# Bass Recording

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Bass recording in #recording-talk covers the DI vs amp debate, DI + mic blend workflows, and the art of capturing bass guitar in a mix-ready way. The community generally recommends always capturing a clean DI, with amp miking as a secondary or parallel signal for character.

## Community Consensus

- **Always take a DI** -- Even if you love the amp sound, the DI is essential for editing and flexibility
- **DI + mic blend is the professional standard** -- Most engineers record both simultaneously
- **Playing dynamics matter enormously** -- "Hitting them harder makes them record bigger. Not necessarily. Can choke out the tone." (BatMeckley)
- **Palm muting technique** is an underrated tonal tool in the recording context

## DI vs Amp

### The Case for DI
- Clean DI provides the best editing reference -- you can see transients clearly
- Essential for [[Reamping]] if you want to try different amp tones later
- Modern DI boxes like [[Radial JDI]], [[Radial J48]], and [[Rupert Neve Designs RNDI]] provide excellent tone on their own
- For many modern productions, a well-recorded DI with plugin amp simulation is sufficient

### The Case for Amp
- Amp miking captures the physical interaction between speaker, cabinet, and room
- [[Electro-Voice RE20]] is frequently mentioned for bass cab miking
- The player responds differently to an amp in the room -- the performance changes
- Low-end from a real bass cabinet has a character that DI alone cannot replicate

### DI + Mic Blend
The standard professional approach:
1. Split the bass signal (DI box with thru output or dedicated splitter)
2. DI goes direct to interface for clean capture
3. Amp gets miked simultaneously
4. Blend to taste during mixing, or commit during tracking if confident

- peterlabberton: "Palm muted P bass between like, the 5th and 10th fret is :chefkiss:"
- Lighter touch often yields bigger recorded tone
- String choice and setup affect the recorded sound significantly

- The instrument itself is the first and most important variable
- Ross Fortune: Timing quantization at 60-80-90% can modernize a bass performance, and "might mean you then have to move bass notes accordingly" to keep bass and drums locked

## Signal Chain Considerations

| Component | Budget | Professional |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| DI Box | [[Radial JDI]] | [[Rupert Neve Designs RNDI]], A Designs REDDI |
| Preamp | Interface preamp | [[Neve 1073]], [[API Preamps]] |
| Compression | Plugin | [[UREI 1176]], [[Teletronix LA-2A]] |
| Amp Mic | [[Shure SM57]] | [[Electro-Voice RE20]], [[Neumann U47]] FET |

## Tips from the Community

- A clean DI with good transient detail makes editing and comping far easier than working from an amp recording
- Consider the bass tone in context of the full arrangement, not in isolation
- Palm muting and pick vs fingers are more impactful tonal choices than most gear decisions
- If tracking live with the full band, isolate the bass amp to prevent bleed into drum mics

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping the DI** when recording through an amp -- Always capture both
- **Digging in too hard** thinking it will sound bigger -- Lighter playing with preamp gain often sounds larger
- **Not checking phase** between DI and amp mic signals
- **Over-compressing on the way in** without leaving room for dynamics
