# Session Mindset and Engineering Philosophy

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Some of the most highly-reacted messages in #recording-talk are not about gear or technique -- they are about mindset, professionalism, and the human side of recording. The community consistently emphasizes that being a great recording engineer is as much about people skills, attitude, and psychological awareness as it is about microphone placement.

## Community Consensus

- **Headspace is everything** -- Your mental state and the artist's comfort determine session quality
- **Be a people person** -- Interpersonal skills are as important as technical skills
- **Pitch can be fixed, emotion cannot** -- Prioritize performance energy over technical perfection
- **Every session is an opportunity to learn** -- Even boring projects offer chances to experiment
- **Communication is almost the whole game** -- From first contact through final delivery
- **Don't be a wuss when recording** -- Commit to sounds and don't kick the can down the road

## Working with Artists

### Creating a Safe Space
> [!quote] BatMeckley (2022-08-20)
> "Headspace is so so important. You guys are already friends, you already get along. He's probably more scared than you are. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, or on him. Singing is a scary thing, a bit like a trust fall, and if the singer sees the engineer is panicking it's not going to be conducive to getting the best performance. Just remember it's not rocket science, it's rock and roll."

### Being a People Person
> [!quote] Zakhiggins (2022-11-11)
> "Just came here to say how important it is to be a people person when recording others. Just back from a session with an extremely talented singer who is also a great song writer -- but he can get really down in the dumps about really minor details and ruin sessions for himself. If it wasn't for the fact that there was cool people in the room to elevate the mood, we absolutely would not have gotten great performances."

### Giving Feedback During Takes
> [!quote] BatMeckley (2022-08-20)
> "When something's genuinely awesome, tell them genuinely. Goes a long way. When something's not, be like 'let's try that again, let's get some options to comp from.' Very rarely is a take ALL bad. 'I especially loved the first three words and the last one. Let's focus on that energy' is helpful. 'I think we've got this, this and this, I'm just looking for this one word.' A lot of times that line actually gets you better takes of other words."

## Performance Over Perfection

> [!quote] BatMeckley (2022-11-16)
> "Pitch can be easily fixed, emotion can not. One of the worst things that a VP can do in a session is sacrifice vibe for pitch. My constant battle in the booth is convincing the artist to make mistakes, to go for it, rather than try to get it 'right'."

### Commitment and Confidence
> [!quote] BatMeckley (2024-02-28) — Pinned
> "Don't be a wuss when you're recording. Don't kick the can down the road. 'Oh God! We clipped one syllable in a 4 minute take'. Whatever. Find it on another take. Don't be so worried about fucking up that you forget to be awesome. Make it sound good."

## The Engineer's Role

### When There Is No Producer
> [!quote] NoahNeedleman (2024-03-30)
> "Being an 'engineer' when there's no 'producer' in the room is tricky. Usually it's cut & dry, make the guitar or vocal or whatever sound good, give them as much time & encouragement as they need to feel confident about the performance. But you still have to be the best listener in the room."

### Reframing the Relationship
> [!quote] Nomograph Mastering (2023-12-01)
> "You're hired for the session, and not going anywhere. Just a simple reframing with better gang/team/tribe language can empower people and unlock better outcomes."

### Not Patronizing the Client
> [!quote] LAPhill (2023-08-09)
> "Want to caution folks against this sort of thing. It's usually not wise to treat your client like an idiot. Better to teach them how much better it can be. Now that artist is going to keep thinking their chain is fire and insisting it get used, rather than realize it was in their way the whole time."

## Professional Attitude

### Every Session Is an Opportunity
> [!quote] cian riordan (2023-11-30)
> "Don't like what you're working on? This is your problem, not the clients. You took the job, now you should do the work. Find something to like about it. I cut my teeth recording weekend warriors in a sleepy surf town -- a lot of spiritual singer songwriters, shitty reggae bands, christian rock, audiobook recordings... you name it, I've probably recorded it. Every session was an opportunity to learn or try something new. If you know something is just a passion project that noone is going to listen to? Try something new on the vocal. Change up the kick drum microphone. Play with some effects plugins. If you're bored in a recording studio, you're doing it wrong."

### Communication Is the Whole Game
> [!quote] cian riordan (2023-11-30)
> "Communication is almost the whole game, from start to finish. How you present yourself in first contact, how you set expectations for the services, expectations for your skills, realistic expectations for optimal outcomes. Computer glitching out on you? Be honest with the client, send them away for 15 minutes while you deal with it. Are you burned out and need a break? Let them know."

### Hi-Fi Recordings of Lo-Fi Sources
> [!quote] NoahNeedleman (2022-10-24)
> "One of my favorite producers told me once his whole vibe is hi fi recordings of lo fi sources."

## The Value of Community

> [!quote] Zack Hames (2023-02-09)
> "I can't emphasize enough how important community is to growing in this industry. I feel very alone in my scene. Everyone stays to themselves and is very competitive in our market and having someone to shoot the shit with on ideas is difficult because no one wants to share their 'secrets'. I am thankful that I get to absorb all these different perspectives, ideas, and experiences and then interpret and apply them to my own work."

## Voice Care and Singer Remedies

> [!quote] Ross Fortune (2023-02-24) — Pinned
> **Voice Remedies:**
> 1. Peppermint Tea and Honey (peppermint opens up the throat and also serves as a healing agent. Honey soothes and serves as a healing agent).
> 2. Gargle warm water and salt. Opens up the vocal cords. Salt removes anything that shouldn't be there and, like honey, is an anti inflammatory.
> 3. Steam. Boil water on the stove and breathe in the steam. Same can be done in the shower.
> 4. Ginger. Another anti inflammatory. Disgusting. But it helps with pain.
> 5. Yawning relaxes the larynx and raises the soft palate.

BatMeckley additions:
- Advil/ibuprofen for bringing down inflammation -- "Always keep some in my studio back pack for singers"
- Lays potato chips can "lube up a throat, help with dry mouth"
- Altoids "do this weird steroid like thing where I've found they give a singer a note or two extra"

## Tips from the Community

- Be positive first. If you cannot be positive, be funny. If you cannot be either, "there might be another place in the business for you" (BatMeckley)
- Convincing the artist to make mistakes yields better takes than chasing perfection
- Keep singer remedies in your studio backpack
- Shoot out your mics periodically -- "recalibrate your life" (BatMeckley)
- Boring sessions are opportunities to experiment with new techniques
- Treat every project with professionalism regardless of the client's budget or profile

## Common Mistakes

- **Sacrificing vibe for pitch** -- Emotion cannot be fixed in post
- **Panicking visibly** when something goes wrong -- The artist mirrors your energy
- **Not communicating honestly** about problems, timelines, or limitations
- **Treating "less important" clients with less effort** -- Every session builds skills and reputation
- **Being so worried about mistakes** that you forget to be creative and bold
- **Patronizing the client** rather than educating them
