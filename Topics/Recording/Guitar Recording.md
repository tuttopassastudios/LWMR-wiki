# Guitar Recording

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Guitar recording in #recording-talk covers electric amp/cab miking, acoustic guitar stereo techniques, DI workflows, and the philosophical approach to capturing guitar tones. The community emphasizes that polar pattern selection is an underutilized tool, that doubling with different guitars beats stereo miking for width, and that the player's relationship with their sound directly affects the performance.

## Community Consensus

- **The guitarist plays differently through different sounds** -- Performance is linked to the monitoring chain
- **Polar patterns matter as much as mic choice** -- Figure 8 on guitar cabs is hugely underrated
- **Double with a different guitar for width** rather than relying on stereo miking techniques
- **A guitar speaker is a heavily filtered lo-fi device** -- What sounds good solo'd may not work in the mix
- **API preamps are favored for guitar** alongside drums

## Electric Guitar: Amp/Cab Miking

### The SM57 Standard
The [[Shure SM57]] remains the default close mic on guitar cabinets, but the community encourages looking beyond it:
- Pairs well with a ribbon or condenser for blended tones
- A 3D-printed bracket can hold an SDC and SM57 on one stand
- Vintage Unidyne III SM57s are reported to sound better than modern ones

### Figure 8 / Polar Pattern Approach
> [!quote] BatMeckley (2022-07-25)
> "Polar patterns are a HUGELY underutilized tool in the box for most engineers I know. I love figure 8 on a lot of sources, guitar especially. I have a sneaking suspicion that much of what many people like about ribbons on guitar cabinets has as much to do with the fact that most are figure 8 patterned as it is the ribbon. I've loved a 414 (a real one) on guitar cabs and or acoustics in fig 8."

### Ribbon Mics on Cabs
- [[Royer Ribbon Mics]] (235 mentions in channel) are a staple for guitar cab recording
- Figure 8 pattern naturally rejects side bleed in live tracking situations
- BatMeckley's insight: the pattern may be as important as the ribbon element itself

### Reverb Placement in Guitar Chain
> [!quote] BatMeckley (2024-11-08)
> "A classic drippy spring type verb I'll usually put before the Iridium so it gets that 60's coming out of your combo amp type sound. A big stereo room or cathedral I'll often use something like 7th Heaven in the box after. Cian hit the nail on the head, in that a guitar speaker is a pretty heavily filtered lo-fi device."

## Acoustic Guitar Miking

### Stereo Technique for Wide Acoustic
> [!quote] cian riordan (2023-01-14)
> "Widest I've gotten is when you get two small condensers, preferably good ones, and you have one at about the 15th fret, above the guitar, about 4-5 inches off of the low E, at a 45 degree angle. Then the other mic is also at 15th fret, below the guitar, pointed up at the high E, 45 deg angle, 4-5 inches off. Pan those hard L and R and you get a wide image across the strings. It can sound massive."

### Doubling vs Stereo Miking
> [!quote] Eric Martin (2023-01-14)
> "I usually just double with a different guitar because I feel like all those techniques end up being big mono for me."

### Keeping the Player in Position
> [!quote] cian riordan (2024-01-03)
> "A fun EV trick he did back in the day is he'd have a mic stand with three cheapy laser pointers attached and would have tape with three dots on the acoustic guitar. Once he had the mics and the player where he wanted them, he'd setup the lasers to point right at the dots on the guitar. That way the player could look down and line up and try and stay in that position."

### Acoustic Guitar Mic Selection
- NoahNeedleman: "each guitar is different. Martins & Gibsons & Taylors may have tendencies, but to count out any make isn't super helpful when looking for your unicorn"
- [[Neumann KM184]] / KM84 are praised for acoustic guitar
- Go light on EQ when tracking -- "the fundamental shifting from song to song in different keys can really fuck you" (NoahNeedleman)

## Guitar Tone Philosophy

> [!quote] Jack (2024-11-13)
> "One of the reasons I own a few guitars, a few gain stages and a few amps — aside from mad dopaminergic satiation — is so I can pick from a mindmap of how these pieces of gear express tonally and can choose my palette based on a sessions demands."

- The palette approach: different guitars, amps, and gain stages for different songs
- Do not chase tone solely through pedals -- the instrument and amp are the foundation

## DI and Reamping for Guitar

- Always capture a clean DI alongside the amp signal for editing reference
- See [[Reamping]] for detailed DI workflow and gear recommendations
- The guitarist's performance is shaped by what they hear -- a DI-only take may lack energy
- Creative reamping through guitar pedals works for vocals and synths too

## Tips from the Community

- Schedule guitar tone time separately from the full band -- "If you wanna focus on guitar tones, have the guitarist come in early" (NoahNeedleman)
- Try figure 8 on a condenser before reaching for a ribbon mic
- Use different guitars for doubled parts rather than stereo miking a single take
- Laser pointer trick for keeping acoustic players in the sweet spot
- Check how the guitar sounds in the mix, not solo'd

## Common Mistakes

- **Defaulting to SM57 without trying other options** -- Especially polar patterns
- **Stereo miking when doubling would serve better** -- Big mono is a real risk
- **Solo'ing the guitar mic and judging tone** -- It needs to work in the full arrangement
- **Heavy EQ on acoustic guitar at tracking** -- Key changes make baked-in EQ problematic
- **Not capturing a DI** for editing reference on electric guitar
