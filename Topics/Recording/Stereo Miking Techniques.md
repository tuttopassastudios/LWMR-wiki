# Stereo Miking Techniques

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Stereo miking techniques are a frequent discussion point in #recording-talk, particularly in the context of drum overheads, acoustic instruments, and ensemble recording. The community debates the trade-offs between XY, ORTF, spaced pair, Blumlein, and mid-side approaches, with a general preference for wider techniques that create an exciting image -- even at the cost of some phase complexity.

## Community Consensus

- **XY is the safest technique** -- Excellent mono compatibility, less exciting width
- **Spaced pair creates more excitement** but introduces phase challenges with close mics
- **Blumlein with ribbons is beautiful for softer material** -- Jazz, chamber, acoustic ensembles
- **ORTF is a practical middle ground** -- More width than XY, better phase than spaced pair
- **The "right" technique depends on the application** and how much you can control the environment

## XY (Coincident Pair)

Two cardioid mics at the same point, angled 90-110 degrees apart.

**Best for:**
- Situations where mono compatibility is critical
- Drum overheads when close mics need to blend cleanly
- BatMeckley: "I tend to xy above the drummers head, or space them like ears"

**Limitations:**
- Less spatial excitement than wider techniques
- Can sound "big mono" in some contexts

## ORTF (Near-Coincident Pair)

Two cardioid mics spaced 17cm apart, angled 110 degrees.

- David Fuller used Soyuz 013 FETs in ORTF for string recording
- More width than XY while maintaining reasonable phase coherence
- A practical choice when you want some spaciousness without the risk of spaced pair

## Spaced Pair

Two mics separated by a wider distance (typically 2-6 feet).

- Eric Martin: Uses spaced pair "very tight, more like cymbal mics" for drums, treating them as spot mics rather than a stereo image
- NoahNeedleman: "X/Y is a much safer bet than a spaced pair with regard to having the OHs play nicely with the close mics"
- Wide spaced pairs on ensemble recording with omni outriggers for orchestral/choral work

## Blumlein (Crossed Figure-8)

Two figure-8 mics at the same point, angled 90 degrees apart.

- Eric Martin: "I also like blumlein ribbons for softer stuff, either a stereo ribbon or mics that are easy to setup blumlein"
- Iwan Morgan: "Went with a Blumlein pair of R84s in the end to contrast to the Line Audio spaces omnis on the string ensemble"
- Captures room ambience naturally due to the rear pickup of figure-8 pattern
- Sensitive to room quality -- works best in good-sounding spaces

## Mid-Side (M/S)

A cardioid (mid) and figure-8 (side) at the same point, decoded for adjustable width.

- Less frequently discussed than other techniques in the channel
- Advantage: Width is adjustable after recording
- Useful when you are uncertain about the final stereo image needs

## Application-Specific Recommendations

| Application | Recommended Technique | Notes |
|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| Drum overheads | L-C-R (cian), XY, or spaced pair | See [[Drum Recording Techniques]] |
| Acoustic guitar | Two SDCs at 15th fret (cian's method) | One above, one below strings |
| String quartet | Spaced pair + spots | David Fuller: "U87 spaced pair and SF24 blumlein" |
| Large ensemble/choir | Stereo pair + omni outriggers | jantrit: Main pair with section spots |
| Leslie speaker | 90-degree corner technique | Calvin Lauber: "mic it so you're forming a 90 degree angle" |
| Piano | SDC pair | See [[Piano and Keys Recording]] |

## Ensemble and Section Recording

### String Sections
> [!quote] LAPhill (2023-12-17)
> "Your 'spot' mics should be probably 18-24 inches away, and you'll save yourself a lot of harshness if you use the stereo pair that covers the whole section as your main sound. Use the spots just for a touch of detail, if you need it."

### Stacking Sections
> [!quote] jantrit (2025-04-23)
> "If planning to stack to make a section I love to set up a stereo room mic and chairs for different positions (cello 1, cello 2, cello 3 etc). Move the player chair to chair between layers but keep the stereo mic in the same spot."

### Gang Vocals / Group Recording
- cian riordan: "Big room, stereo mics... do different takes with the gang standing in different positions, close and far, etc. Power in numbers."

## Tips from the Community

- Use the stereo pair as the foundation of the sound; treat close/spot mics as supplements
- For stacking parts to simulate sections, keep the room mic stationary while moving the player
- The Leslie speaker benefits from a specific 90-degree corner technique
- When in doubt, XY is the safe starting point -- you can always try wider techniques on the next pass
- Match your technique to the quality of the room -- wider techniques expose the room more

## Common Mistakes

- **Using spaced pair without checking phase** against close mics
- **Defaulting to one technique for everything** -- Each has specific strengths
- **Ignoring room quality** when using techniques that capture more room (Blumlein, spaced pair)
- **Over-relying on width** at the expense of mono compatibility
- **Placing spot mics too close** to string sections, creating harshness
