# Room Mics and Ambient Recording

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Room microphones and ambient recording techniques are extensively discussed in #recording-talk, with over 400 substantive messages covering philosophy, placement, processing, and the critical question of when NOT to use room mics. The community consensus is that room mics should capture a room worth hearing -- and most rooms are not worth capturing.

## Community Consensus

- **Most rooms are not worth capturing** -- Room mics are not a default; they are a deliberate choice
- **The room itself must sound good** before room mics add value
- **Room mics can be the most exciting element** of a drum recording when the space is right
- **Heavy compression on room mics** is a classic technique for explosive, larger-than-life drum sounds
- **Bleed management is about mic choice, placement, and arrangement** -- Not just isolation

## Room Mic Philosophy

### When to Use Room Mics
> [!quote] cian riordan (2024-07-17)
> "What makes a great drum room? I think most would agree that the answer is a medium to large sized room, with tall-ish ceilings, non-parallel walls; not too slappy sounding, and not too boomy sounding. Control is the key word here."

- Great rooms (Ocean Way, Sound City, Conway) justify dedicated room mic setups
- Live tracking with a full band in a good space can yield magical room captures
- Room mics provide depth and three-dimensionality that close mics alone cannot

### When NOT to Use Room Mics
> [!quote] BatMeckley (2025-12-27)
> "Unless you're going for that coveted 'small hard walled phasey slap' sound, I wouldn't even bother with room mics. Room mics should capture the room, and this doesn't scream 'room I want to capture' and to be fair, MOST rooms I don't want to capture. It's why Ocean Way can sell room impulse responses; it's hard to find a good drum room. Fake it til you can get to Conway or SoundCity."

## Room Mic Techniques

### Unconventional Placement
> [!quote] cian riordan (2025-01-21)
> "Everyone else out here doing room mics over the drums" [implying his are placed elsewhere -- behind, below, in adjacent spaces]

### Cross-Instrument Room Capture
> [!quote] montrose recording (2025-02-22)
> "Using mics that are already up on other instruments are my favorite room mics. esp piano mics on drum kit etc."

- Piano mics in a live room naturally capture a beautiful room perspective on drums
- This technique works best in live tracking situations where multiple instruments share a space

### Compressed Room Mics
- Ross Fortune: [[Coles 4038]] "driven into deranged madness with a pair of Distressors in Nuke" for explosive drum rooms
- Zack Hames: "The SSL channel compressors set to stun on room mics seriously do so much" for Phil Collins-style sounds
- R88 close with TG1 compression is another favored combination

### Multiple Room Mic Perspectives
- peterlabberton: "Do LCR overs and like 3 pairs of room mics" -- Multiple distances and angles give mix options
- Ross Fortune: Two sets of rooms that could be opened up track-dependent, allowing different sonic characters per song

### Room Mics as Reverb Sends
> [!quote] NoahNeedleman (2023-07-30)
> "I love using a second mic further back in the room, and then if I need real ambience on that instrument, I use that second mic as the send. Surprisingly deeper / wider imaging."

## Tracking Room vs Control Room Acoustics

> [!quote] cian riordan (2025-02-21)
> "I find all of the best resources for acoustics tend to be geared towards making room monitoring useful for translation (with respect to mixing and mastering). I find very little of the acoustics discourse useful for guidance on how to record real instruments in real spaces. Not to mention that any revered tracking space over the past 100 years would likely never pass a frequency response sniff test."

The community distinguishes between:
- **Mixing room acoustics** -- Flat response, controlled reflections, translation accuracy
- **Tracking room acoustics** -- Character, musicality, inspiration, "interesting" over "correct"

## Bleed Management

### Philosophy
- Bleed is not inherently bad -- In a good room with good players, bleed adds glue and dimension
- In a bad room or with timing issues, bleed becomes destructive

### Practical Techniques
- Use gobos to shield drum mics from guitar amps
- cian riordan: "Do everything you can to protect the drum microphones from the guitar amps. Use the gobos to shield the drum microphones from guitar amps. Moving the amps outside of the room will solve LOTS of problems"
- Cardioid and figure-8 patterns can reject bleed from specific directions
- chrissorem shared jazz live recording setups using isolation techniques while maintaining line-of-sight between musicians

## Isolation Techniques

- Gobos between instruments during live tracking
- Moving amplifiers to separate rooms or iso booths
- Using headphones for monitoring to eliminate playback bleed
- Figure-8 pattern mics positioned to null toward bleed sources

## Tips from the Community

- If your room does not sound good with drums, skip room mics and use reverb plugins instead
- Impulse responses from great rooms (Ocean Way, etc.) are a legitimate alternative
- Room mics through heavy compression is a production technique, not a mixing fix
- Use room mics as reverb sends during mixing for natural-sounding ambience
- Record at least one pair of room mics even if you are unsure -- you can always mute them

## Common Mistakes

- **Defaulting to room mics in a bad-sounding room** -- This captures problems, not character
- **Using room mics without compression** and expecting them to sound exciting
- **Not managing bleed** when tracking multiple instruments simultaneously
- **Treating tracking room acoustics** the same as mixing room acoustics
- **Ignoring the room mic contribution** when checking phase on close mics
