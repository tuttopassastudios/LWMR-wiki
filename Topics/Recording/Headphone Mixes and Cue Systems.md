# Headphone Mixes and Cue Systems

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Headphone mixes and cue systems are critical to getting great performances during recording sessions. The #recording-talk community emphasizes that what the artist hears directly affects how they perform -- a bad headphone mix leads to bad takes. Topics range from headphone selection and click management to the philosophy of controlling the artist's monitoring environment.

## Community Consensus

- **The headphone mix is a performance tool** -- It directly shapes the quality of takes
- **The engineer should control the headphone mix** -- Not the artist (in most cases)
- **Click bleed is a real problem** that requires active management
- **Drummer headphones need isolation** -- Vic Firth drummer headphones are recommended
- **The artist hearing themselves well** is more important than hearing everything else

## Headphone Mix Philosophy

> "For the most part at my place I'm in control of the singer's mix and I like it that way. I will certainly ask them what they need, and together dial in a good mix for themselves (it's also a good trust building exercise) but then during the take I love if they're pushing too hard to be able to sneakily pull back their vocal in the headphones to help them ease off."

Key principles:
- Build the headphone mix collaboratively with the artist at the start of the session
- Maintain control to make subtle adjustments during takes
- Pulling back the vocalist's level in headphones can help them ease off when pushing too hard
- Adding reverb/effects to the headphone mix helps vocalists feel comfortable

## Click Track Management

> "Band passing the click can be useful. With sealed headphones you can get away with brighter click with less mids, as the headphone cups tend to attenuate the high end more."

- Click bleed into microphones is a common problem, especially with open-back headphones
- Use sealed/closed-back headphones for tracking
- Band-pass filtering the click reduces bleed -- remove mids, keep it bright and clicky
- Lower click volume is always better if the performer can still follow it

## Headphone Selection for Tracking

| Use Case | Recommendation | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Drummers | Vic Firth isolation headphones | "do a good job at this" -- cian riordan |
| Vocalists | Closed-back (sealed) | Prevents bleed into vocal mic |
| General tracking | [[Beyerdynamic DT770]] | Community standard for closed-back tracking |
| Guitarists | Closed-back or none | Some prefer amp monitoring in the room |

## Isolation and Bleed Prevention

- cian riordan: "Do everything you can to protect the drum microphones from the guitar amps. Moving the amps outside of the room will solve LOTS of problems, so if you have the patience to wire up that headphone stuff... you'll be much happier come mix time."
- Running amps in separate rooms requires a well-organized headphone/cue system
- The trade-off: better isolation vs less natural feel for the musicians

## Talkback

- Talkback mic in the control room is essential for communication during takes
- Nomograph Mastering (joking): "Beta 52 for talkback seems awfully specific" -- Use whatever is handy
- Keep talkback routing simple and reliable -- fumbling with communication kills session flow

## Tips from the Community

- Build the headphone mix as a trust exercise at the beginning of the session
- Add reverb to vocals in the headphone mix -- singers perform better when they sound good to themselves
- Secretly adjusting levels during takes is a powerful tool for guiding performance
- Use sealed headphones and filtered click to minimize bleed
- For drum tracking, invest in proper isolation headphones
- Test the headphone system before the artist arrives

## Common Mistakes

- **Letting the artist control their own mix entirely** -- They may not know what they need
- **Loud click through open-back headphones** -- Creates audible bleed in recordings
- **Not adding effects to the headphone mix** -- Dry vocals in headphones feel exposed and uncomfortable
- **Poor talkback setup** -- Communication problems slow sessions down
- **Using the same headphone mix for every musician** -- Drummers, vocalists, and guitarists all need different balances
