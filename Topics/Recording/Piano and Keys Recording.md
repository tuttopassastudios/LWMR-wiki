# Piano and Keys Recording

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Piano and keyboard recording is a recurring topic in #recording-talk, covering grand piano, upright piano, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, and other keyboard instruments. The community emphasizes that pianos are "phasey as hell" and that the room plays a huge role in the final sound. Small diaphragm condensers -- particularly the [[Neumann KM184]] / KM84 -- are the most recommended mics for piano.

## Community Consensus

- **KM84 / KM184 are the gold standard** for piano recording
- **Pianos are inherently phase-complex** -- Don't overthink placement, but do check phase
- **The room matters enormously** -- Piano mics in another room can serve as incredible drum room mics
- **Remove the front panel on uprights** for a more direct, clear sound
- **Go light on EQ when tracking piano** -- Key changes across songs make baked-in EQ problematic

## Grand Piano

### Mic Placement
- Open the lid fully for a brighter, more projected sound
- Stereo pair over the strings is the most common approach
- Small diaphragm condensers ([[Neumann KM184]], Soyuz 013 FET) are preferred for accuracy
- dudeitsmarcus: "decided to throw a Coles under the grand piano for the hell of it. sounds awesome!" -- Ribbon mics can add warmth
- chrissorem on tonal zones: "I almost always mic the bridge of piano, I find that it's the richest in tone and even in notes. Micing the hammers can be cool for some mechanical sound... moving further from the piano will make it darker and less articulated"

### The 414 Omni Hammer Technique
> [!quote] Ross Fortune (2023-02-09)
> "That 414 omnis thing originally came from Jimmy Napes' engineer Gus Pirelli. They were writing Sam Smith's 2017 album at Livingstone Studios in north London, and on the occasions when Sam might, eh, not turn up, Gus and the assistant would spend the time trying different arrays on various instruments. After a day of grand piano experiments, they determined the 414 B-ULS omnis on hammers + 87 body to be the ultimate combo."

### The Piano-as-Room-Mic Trick
> [!quote] montrose recording (2025-02-22)
> "using mics that are already up on other instruments are my favorite room mics. esp piano mics on drum kit etc"

When tracking a full band live, piano mics in the room capture a natural ambient perspective of the entire ensemble.

## Upright Piano

> [!quote] cian riordan (2023-11-23)
> "First thing I'd suggest is pulling off the front panel if you haven't already. It'll give a much more direct, clear sound and will help you better visualize where you're putting the mics. Those KM84s are going to sound wonderful... would be hard to argue for a better pair of mics on upright."

### Tape Bridge Technique
chrissorem shared a "piano tape bridge" technique for dampening/modifying the piano sound -- a creative approach to getting specific tonal colors.

## Rhodes and Wurlitzer

> [!quote] cian riordan (2024-05-10)
> "Dynamics have always been ideal for me as they won't pick up as much of the keyboard noise given how close they are. 441 had always worked well. But my ideal Wurli recording move has always been defeating the speaker (with a 1/4\" adapter in the headphone jack) and using an Ampeg Jet with an m160 on it. Very flexible from dark to bright, dirty to clean, and a nice spring reverb that blends well."

- Dynamic mics help reject mechanical keyboard noise
- Defeating the internal speaker and running through an external amp gives more tonal control
- Sennheiser 441 works well for close miking Rhodes/Wurlitzer

## Tracking Tips

> [!quote] NoahNeedleman (2023-02-12)
> "Also go light on eq'ing on the way in -- the fundamental shifting from song to song in different keys can really fuck you."

- Phase is inherently complex with piano -- Oli J: "Pianos are phasey as hell anyway so don't sweat placement"
- Consider the room sound carefully -- position the piano where it sounds best acoustically before placing mics
- For live tracking with a band, piano mics often double as valuable room captures

## Recommended Mic Choices

| Instrument | First Choice | Alternatives |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Grand Piano | [[Neumann KM184]] pair | Soyuz 013 FET, [[Coles 4038]] (for warmth) |
| Upright Piano | [[Neumann KM184]] / KM84 pair | Any quality SDC pair |
| Rhodes/Wurlitzer | Sennheiser 441, dynamic mics | Beyerdynamic M160 (on external amp) |

## Common Mistakes

- **Not removing the front panel on uprights** -- It blocks direct sound access
- **Heavy EQ during tracking** -- Key changes between songs make this risky
- **Over-thinking mic placement** given that pianos are naturally phase-complex
- **Ignoring the room** -- Piano recording quality is heavily room-dependent
- **Using only close mics** without capturing the room perspective
