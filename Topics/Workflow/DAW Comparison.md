# DAW Comparison

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> A cross-reference guide comparing major DAWs discussed in the community. No single DAW is universally "best" — each excels in different areas. Many professional engineers use multiple DAWs for different tasks. This page synthesizes community opinions across Pro Tools, Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Cubase, and Reaper.

## Comparison Matrix

| Category | [[Pro Tools]] | [[Ableton Live]] | [[Logic Pro]] | [[Cubase]] | [[Reaper]] |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Best For** | Tracking, mixing, editing | Production, sound design, live performance | All-around, production | Post-production, MIDI, export | Power users, customization |
| **CPU Efficiency** (M1 benchmark) | #1 | #4 | #3 | Not tested | #2 |
| **Price** | Subscription | $750+ | $200 | $580+ | $60 |
| **Plugin Format** | AAX | VST, AU | AU | VST, VST3 | VST, AU, JS |
| **Export Workflow** | Good | Poor | Good | Excellent | Good |
| **Comping/Playlists** | Excellent | Basic (Live 11+) | Very good | Good | Good |
| **Creative Workflow** | Limited | Excellent | Good | Good | Good (after setup) |
| **Video Support** | Good (Ultimate: multi) | Basic | Single video only | Excellent (Nuendo) | Good |
| **Industry Adoption** | Dominant (studios) | Dominant (producers) | Common (Apple users) | Niche (post, EU) | Growing (indie) |
| **Customizability** | Low | Medium | Low | Medium | Extremely high |

## Community DAW Journeys

Many experienced engineers have used multiple DAWs and settled on workflows that combine strengths:

> "My evolution: ~2003 GarageBand > Logic 8-9 > Ableton 6-11 > Pro Tools 9-current. Pro Tools wins for tracking and mixing. Ableton feels amazing for writing and production."

> [!quote] Source
> **Author:** ALXCPH — **Date:** 2022-11-15 — **Channel:** #daw-talk
> "I started in GarageBand, then Logic 7-9, then Ableton 8 and Pro Tools, and now I'm using Ableton and Reaper. The reason I like Ableton is because getting stuff done takes less steps. Audio manipulation and sound design is such a breeze."

> **Author:** mixedbywong_my — **Date:** 2021-12-20 — **Channel:** #daw-talk
> "I was using PT at a previous job. My next job used Nuendo, which is somewhat Cubase but with more audio post features. Mixing in Cubase seems easier in terms of routing and creating buses."

> [!quote] Source
> **Author:** Slow Hand — **Date:** 2023-11-14 — **Channel:** #daw-talk
> "I want Pro Tools to be a beast for tracking, mixing, and editing. I want Ableton to be fast and fluid for generating ideas. I want Cubase to do really detailed sequencing. I want Reaper to be an over-optimized GUI nightmare."

## When to Use Which DAW

- **Starting a career in studios:** Learn [[Pro Tools]] first, [[Logic Pro]] second (Slow Hand)
- **Production and beatmaking:** [[Ableton Live]] for speed and creativity (oaklandmatt)
- **Mixing professionally:** [[Pro Tools]] for AudioSuite, comping, and industry compatibility
- **Post-production/scoring:** [[Cubase]] or Nuendo for video support and MIDI (mixedbywong_my)
- **Budget-conscious power users:** [[Reaper]] for $60 with infinite customization
- **Apple ecosystem all-rounder:** [[Logic Pro]] for $200 with everything included

## The Multi-DAW Approach

Several community members advocate using different DAWs for different tasks:
- Produce in Ableton → mix in Pro Tools (Ross Fortune, oaklandmatt)
- Write in Ableton → track in Pro Tools → mix in Pro Tools
- Use Reaper for vocal production, Ableton for everything else (ALXCPH)

> **Author:** Adam Thein — **Date:** 2023-12-12 — **Channel:** #daw-talk
> "I'm at the start of the multi-DAW journey. Goal would be Jeff Ellis style — able to receive sessions in whatever state and format they were in."

## Common Mistakes

- Choosing a DAW based on perceived sound quality (all DAWs sum identically — see [[DAW Summing and Sound Differences]])
- Switching DAWs without committing to learning the new one deeply
- Not investing in templates and customization for your chosen DAW
- Assuming one DAW is objectively "better" rather than "better for specific tasks"
