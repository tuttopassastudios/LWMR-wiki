# Learning Resources and Education

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> The #general-talk community shares and evaluates learning resources for audio production — courses, YouTube channels, books, and mentorship approaches. The strongest consensus: nothing replaces doing the work, and community learning (like this Discord) accelerates growth faster than passive consumption.

## Detail

### Community-Recommended Platforms

**Paid courses:**
- **Mix with the Masters** — consistently cited as the highest-quality resource for intermediate-to-advanced mixing
- **Nail the Mix** — monthly mixing exercises with real multitracks
- **PureMix** — video tutorials with professional engineers
- **Groove3** — DAW-specific and plugin-specific tutorials

**Free resources:**
- **YouTube channels** — Pensado's Place, Produce Like a Pro, Recording Revolution mentioned frequently
- **Discord communities** — this server itself is repeatedly cited as the most valuable learning resource

> It's no overstatement to say that you *are* this server and the reason for its success. We've got a very special community that's been built up over our short history and this place would fall apart if each and every one of us wasn't maintaining the level of discourse.

### The Learning Curve

Community wisdom on the audio learning journey:
- **Year 1-2** — learning tools, basic technique, finding your ear
- **Year 3-5** — developing taste, building speed, finding your voice
- **Year 5-10** — refinement, specialization, teaching others

### Practice vs Consumption

The community strongly emphasizes active practice over passive learning:
- **Mix real songs** — volunteer to mix for local artists, not just tutorial multitracks
- **Ear training** — actively listening and analyzing professional mixes
- **Deliberate practice** — focusing on weaknesses rather than repeating what you're comfortable with
- **Reference mixing** — A/B comparing your work against professional releases

### Mentorship

The server's culture of mentorship is one of its defining features:
- Verified experts answer questions across all channels
- Community Profiles series (by austenballard) highlights member journeys
- oaklandmatt's live streams provide real-time education
