# Career Development for Audio Professionals

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> The #general-talk channel is the server's richest source of career advice, with 1,652 messages covering freelancing, transitioning to full-time audio work, building a client base, internships, and sustainable career trajectories. oaklandmatt, NoahNeedleman, Slow Hand, and BatMeckley provide the most-cited career guidance.

## Detail

### The Path to Full-Time

The community's consensus arc for going full-time in audio:

1. **Build skills while employed** — work a day job and take every project you can on nights/weekends
2. **Build a client base organically** — through venue networking, word of mouth, and genuine relationships
3. **Establish financial runway** — save enough to cover 6-12 months of expenses before transitioning
4. **Go full-time gradually** — reduce day job hours as audio income increases, rather than quitting cold

> Do all of it. Show your work, show your process, reach out to people, etc etc. Spend some time doing ALL of it, and then figure out what rhythms and processes you feel authentic doing. Everything new always feels weird. But suffer through that and you'll find what sticks.

### Internships and Assisting

Studio assisting is consistently recommended as the fastest path to professional development:

> I worked hard to build a culture on the road where my team raises their hands when something goes wrong and points their fingers when something goes right.

Key principles:
- **Be proactive** — anticipate needs before being asked
- **Own your mistakes** — the community emphasizes radical accountability in studio environments
- **Document everything** — take notes on every session technique you observe
- **Build relationships, not just skills** — the people you assist become your network

### Education: Formal vs Self-Taught

The community is split but leans toward experience over formal education:
- **Audio school** — useful for networking and hands-on gear access, but expensive and not required
- **Self-teaching** — YouTube, courses (Mix with the Masters, Nail the Mix, PureMix), and community mentorship
- **Apprenticeship** — the most consistently recommended path: find a working engineer and assist them

### Sustainable Freelancing

Long-term career sustainability patterns discussed:
- **Diversify income streams** — mixing, mastering, production, teaching, session work
- **Raise rates gradually** — undercharging creates unsustainable volume pressure
- **Protect creative time** — schedule admin work separately from creative sessions
- **Maintain relationships** — follow up with past clients, stay visible in your scene

### Work-Life Balance

> At the urging of Cian & Ruairi and a few other good friends, I took a full 3 months off when my daughter was born. During my paternity leave, my creative outlets were cooking, and photography.
