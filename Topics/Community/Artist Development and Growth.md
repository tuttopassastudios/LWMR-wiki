### Finding Your Sound

The community's perspective on developing artistic identity:

> Do all of it. Show your work, show your process, reach out to people. Spend some time doing ALL of it, and then figure out what rhythms and processes you feel authentic doing.

Key principles:
- **Volume of work** — make a lot of things, taste develops through doing
- **Reference widely** — study the sounds you love and analyze what makes them work
- **Accept evolution** — your sound will change over years, and that's healthy
- **Serve the artist** — as an engineer/producer, your "sound" should enhance, not override

### Social Media and Promotion

The community's approach to self-promotion is notably restrained:

> Two very strict rules we have here are "no self-promotion" and "no politics." It keeps this place focused on helping each other make better records.

Discussion topics around social media:
- **Show your process** — behind-the-scenes content performs better than self-congratulation
- **Authenticity over frequency** — posting when you have something genuine to share
- **TikTok and Instagram** — platforms discussed as discovery tools, not validation metrics
- **Community over followers** — the server philosophy emphasizes genuine relationships

### Supporting Artist Growth

For engineers and producers working with developing artists:
- Help artists articulate their vision rather than imposing yours
- Create a safe space for experimentation in the studio
- Understand that artist development is a long game
- The producer's role includes emotional support and creative confidence-building

### Standing Out in a Crowded Field

> Next time someone gets at you about not posting try hearing it as "Man, we think you're good and we'd like the world to know."
