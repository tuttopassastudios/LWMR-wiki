# Plugin Formats and Compatibility

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Audio plugins come in several formats — AAX (Pro Tools), VST/VST3 (cross-platform), and AU (macOS). Format choice is dictated by DAW: Pro Tools requires AAX, Logic uses AU, and Ableton/Cubase/Reaper support VST and/or AU. The Apple Silicon transition created significant compatibility challenges, with Rosetta bridging the gap during the transition period.

## Detail

### Format Overview

| Format | Developer | DAW Support | Notes |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **[[AAX]]** | Avid | [[Pro Tools]] only | Required for Pro Tools; limits plugin availability |
| **[[VST]]/VST3** | Steinberg | [[Cubase]], [[Reaper]], [[Ableton Live]] | Most widely supported cross-platform format |
| **[[AU]]** (Audio Units) | Apple | [[Logic Pro]], [[Ableton Live]], [[Reaper]] | macOS only |

### Apple Silicon Compatibility

The M1 transition created a multi-year compatibility challenge:

- [[Logic Pro]] went M1-native first — Rosetta-only plugins couldn't load in native mode (Slow Hand, 2021)
- [[Ableton Live]] and most others ran under Rosetta initially, allowing older plugins to work
- Plugin developers needed to release separate M1-native builds
- Many developers have since updated, but some legacy plugins remain Rosetta-only

### VST3 Goes Open Source (October 2025)

In October 2025, Steinberg/Yamaha released the VST 3.8.0 SDK as open source (10 reactions in #nerd-talk — one of the channel's most-reacted posts). This has significant implications for the plugin ecosystem:

- **Lower barrier to entry** for plugin developers — No licensing fees or agreements required
- **AI-assisted development** becomes more practical — Open-source code can be used with AI coding tools to accelerate VST3 plugin creation
- **Community-driven improvements** to the SDK are now possible
- **Long-term format stability** — Open-source governance reduces the risk of Steinberg making breaking changes

> [!note]
> The nerd-talk community discussed whether this could accelerate the transition away from VST2 (which Steinberg stopped licensing in 2018) and whether it might encourage DAWs currently not supporting VST3 to adopt it.

### AAX Limitations

Pro Tools' AAX-only requirement can limit plugin choices and create stability issues:

### Licensing and Authorization

Plugin licensing varies by manufacturer — iLok, native licensing, subscription models. The iLok system remains controversial:

> "Why does every company have a download manager and installer app? I generally groan at them all — Acustica, IK, Steinberg. I don't need to see products I don't own."

## Practical Application

- Check plugin format support before purchasing — verify your DAW supports the format
- When running Apple Silicon, verify M1-native support for critical plugins before upgrading
- Pro Tools users: ensure plugins are AAX-compatible before purchase
- Consider DAW format support when choosing a new DAW

## Common Mistakes

- Buying plugins in the wrong format for your DAW
- Upgrading macOS/hardware without checking plugin compatibility first
- Assuming Rosetta performance equals native performance
- Not maintaining plugin backups (licenses, installers)
