# Outboard vs In-The-Box

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> One of the most enduring debates in audio production: when does hardware outboard gear justify its cost, complexity, and recall headaches over in-the-box plugin processing? This guide presents the community's nuanced perspectives, which lean heavily toward a pragmatic hybrid approach rather than dogma on either side.

## Community Consensus

- **Plugins have largely caught up** for mixing purposes -- the quality gap has narrowed dramatically
- **The recall problem is real** -- This is the single biggest practical argument against outboard in mixing
- **Outboard on the way IN (tracking) is where hardware shines** -- Nearly unanimous agreement
- **The process matters as much as the sound** -- Using hardware changes how you work, which changes your results
- **Speed and convenience win** in a professional client-facing environment
- **"Use what inspires you"** is the community's default answer to analog vs digital

## The Case for Outboard

### Tracking (Recording)
The community strongly agrees that outboard gear during tracking is the most impactful use of hardware:

> [!quote] Will Melones
> "My recording has gotten much better since I started using gear on the way IN."

- Committing to sounds during recording forces better decisions and creates a more "finished" feeling in the raw tracks
- Mic preamp character (transformer saturation, tube warmth) cannot be perfectly replicated after the fact
- Hardware compressors during tracking (especially on vocals and drums) shape the performance in ways that encourage better musicianship

### Mixing with Outboard
- **Individual channels**: Several members commit outboard processing to individual tracks, then print. This preserves the ability to adjust the mix while getting hardware character
- **Bus processing**: More debated -- the convenience loss is significant for bus processing
- **Transformers and opamps touching audio** adds subtle harmonic content that accumulates pleasantly

> [!quote] BatMeckley
> "I think it's also more the *approach* than the gear itself. Like once I've sent it out and printed it, I treat it differently. Guys like Serb bury me and he's all in the box, so I don't know if analog technically sounds better, but for me the process makes me mix better. Like if you have an analog camera you spend more care framing your shot."

### The Workflow Argument
- Hardware forces commitment, which prevents endless tweaking
- Tactile interaction (reaching for a knob vs clicking a mouse) engages different creative instincts
- Working with fewer options (one compressor vs 40 plugins) can accelerate decision-making
- Using hardware makes you listen more and look at screens less

## The Case for In-The-Box

### Recall and Revisions
> [!quote] hyanrarvey
> "It's just not worth the bullshit of recalls. Time is money."

This is the #1 practical argument. When a client comes back 6 months later wanting a tweak, an ITB session opens exactly as you left it. Outboard settings from a shared studio are long gone.

### Speed and Efficiency
- No patching, no level matching, no printing
- Instant A/B comparison between settings
- Unlimited instances of any processor
- Work from anywhere on a laptop

### Plugin Quality
> [!quote] popaganda
> "I thought I needed analog stuff for a long time, but the pluses of ITB are hard to argue against."

- Modern plugin emulations of classic hardware are extremely convincing
- The ITB [[Neve 33609]] emulation "sounds good enough" for bus duty
- CPU power is now abundant enough to run complex plugin chains without compromise

### Democratization
- A $200/year plugin subscription gives access to emulations of gear that would cost $100,000+ in hardware
- This levels the playing field for engineers who cannot afford or house large amounts of outboard

## The Hybrid Approach (Community Favorite)

The most common workflow among active community members:

> [!quote] popaganda
> "I'd commit gear to tracks but keep busses ITB."

### Typical Hybrid Workflow
1. **Track through outboard** -- Preamps, compressors, and EQ on the way in. Commit the sound
2. **Mix ITB** -- Use plugins for the bulk of mixing work
3. **Print select channels through hardware** -- When a specific piece of outboard adds something plugins cannot match
4. **Keep bus processing ITB** -- For recall flexibility on the mix bus and subgroups

### What the Pros Actually Do
> [!quote] hyanrarvey
> "We have all the fucking gear but we still mix ITB."

Even engineers with access to SSL consoles, racks of Neve and API gear, and Fairchild compressors frequently choose to mix in the box for practical reasons. The gear gets used during tracking, as insert effects on specific sources, or for mastering.

## Where Outboard Still Wins (According to the Community)

- **Mic preamps** -- Character preamps during tracking (Ampex 350, Neve 1073, API 512)
- **Tracking compressors** -- Especially on vocals (LA-2A, 1176, Distressor)
- **Unique hardware** -- Fairchild, DW Fearn, vintage gear that has no convincing plugin equivalent
- **Transformer/tube saturation** -- The cumulative effect of analog signal paths
- **The creative process** -- When the tactile experience genuinely changes your approach

## Where Plugins Have Won

- **EQ** -- Plugin EQs are often more precise and flexible
- **Delay and reverb** -- ITB effects are often superior to all but the most exotic hardware
- **Bus compression** -- Good enough for most applications, with perfect recall
- **Analysis and metering** -- No contest
- **Anything requiring automation** -- ITB automation is infinitely more precise

## Common Debates

### "Does Analog Summing Matter?"
A heated topic. The community is broadly skeptical:
- **Against**: "Analog summing ain't it for me... the only real color you get is whatever is bringing it back up to line" -- hyanrarvey
- **Against**: Bryan DiMaio tried SSL Sigma, Shadow Hills Equinox, and RND 5057 summing and "ultimately gave up on having any sort of analog mixbus due to the convenience lost"
- **For**: Some members are having custom summing mixers built because nothing on the market satisfies them
- **Nuance**: If you want analog character on the mix bus, patching through a console center section (SSL VCA bus compressor, for example) may be more effective than passive summing

### "Can You Hear the Difference?"
> [!quote] peterlabberton
> "Confirmation bias is powerful. It would be really hard for me to reliably say I hear a difference without being able to A/B in real time."

The community acknowledges that sighted comparisons are unreliable. Properly level-matched, blind ABX testing is the gold standard, but few have done it rigorously.

## Tips from the Community

- **Start ITB**, learn your tools deeply, and add hardware only when you hit a specific limitation
- If considering outboard for mixing, ask: "Does running X through Y piece of gear give me a result nothing else can get me to?" If yes, do it. If it is just about convenience or habit, stay ITB
- **Print outboard on individual tracks during the session** rather than running hardware on buses -- this gives you the best of both worlds
- Factor in the total cost of ownership: outboard needs conversion (AD/DA channels), cabling, rack space, maintenance, and power
- Do not let gear acquisition distract from developing your ears and musical taste

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming outboard will "fix" weak mixes** -- If your mixes are not working ITB, adding hardware will not solve the underlying issues
- **Using outboard on buses when revisions are likely** -- This creates enormous headaches
- **Not printing/committing when using outboard** -- Leaving outboard as live inserts means you lose recall and tie up converter channels
- **Buying hardware versions of plugins you already own** just for the sake of having analog
- **Ignoring the converter cost** -- Every hardware insert requires 2 channels of AD/DA conversion, which adds up fast

The community trend is clear: side racks with 500 series and patchbays, minimal desk footprint, everything always connected. P.K. Stephan's hybrid rig — "I like having everything connected and mic'ed up because I notice that I only use the stuff that I can access quickly" (30 reactions) — captures the consensus that accessibility determines whether outboard gets used. LAPhill's comprehensive studio wiring (Tim O'Sullivan build-out, 31 reactions) demonstrates the end-state of mature hybrid integration.
