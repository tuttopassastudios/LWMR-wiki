# DIY and Clone Gear

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> The DIY and clone gear scene is a thriving part of the pro audio community, ranging from simple cable repairs to full 500-series module builds and microphone modifications. This guide covers soldering basics, recommended kits and manufacturers, the ethics and economics of clones, and practical advice from community members who build and modify their own gear.

## Community Consensus

- **Everyone should be able to solder cables** -- This is considered a basic studio skill, not an advanced DIY project
- **Clone manufacturers like Warm Audio provide genuine value** -- The community is broadly supportive of affordable clones that open up classic sounds to more people
- **DIY kits from DIYRE, Hairball Audio, and others** are excellent learning tools and produce professional-quality results
- **Modding budget gear** (ART preamps, cheap condensers) can yield surprisingly good results for minimal investment
- **Vintage gear is not magic** -- Well-built clones using quality components can match or approach originals

## Getting Started: Soldering Basics

### Essential Soldering Kit ($75-100 total)

| Item | Recommendation | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Soldering station | Weller, Hakko, or Aoyue (<$50 station) | Get a station, NOT a loose wall-plug iron. Temperature control is essential |
| Solder | Kester 275 (lead-free) or standard lead solder | Lead solder flows better but requires ventilation. Cardas silver solder for critical audio connections |
| Tip cleaner | Brass wool ball | NOT steel wool -- brass is standard |
| Solder sucker | Engineer SS-02 (Adafruit) | "The solder wick shit is terrible in most applications" -- Felix Byrne |
| Helping hands / Panavise | Any will do | Holds work pieces while you solder |
| Fan | Desktop fan | "Use a fan to blow the solder smoke away from your brain" -- Rollmottle |

> [!tip] Key Advice
> "The biggest thing on staying sane when doing repairs is keep everything clean. Just a pain in the ass when you come back to fix a cable and everything is caked on from the last thing months ago." -- Felix Byrne

### Soldering Tips
- Get a station with at least temperature control; a specific readout is nice but not critical
- Keep tips clean between joints
- Use a proper solder sucker for desoldering, not wick
- Practice on junk cables before touching anything important
- Lead solder is easier to work with but use proper ventilation

## Clone Manufacturers

### Warm Audio
The most frequently discussed clone manufacturer in the community. Reception is generally positive:

| Product | Original | Community Verdict |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| [[Warm Audio WA-87]] | [[Neumann U87]] | Solid vocal mic for the price |
| [[Warm Audio WA-251]] | [[Telefunken ELA M 251]] | "Really great, especially for the price" |
| [[Warm Audio WA-47jr]] | [[Neumann U47 FET]] | Great for kick drum low end; clean but not "rich" |
| [[Warm Audio WA-76]] | [[Universal Audio 1176]] | Widely endorsed |
| [[Warm Audio WA-73]] | [[Neve 1073]] | Functional 1073-style preamp |

### Other Clone/Budget Manufacturers

| Manufacturer | Known For | Community Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| [[Klark Teknik]] | Behringer-owned clones (76-KT, etc.) | Controversial but functional. Extremely affordable |
| [[Heritage Audio]] | Neve-style equipment | Higher quality than most budget clones |
| [[Electric and Company]] | Ampex 350 reproductions | "Look really cool" -- not widely tested by community |
| SSL-style bus comp manufacturers | Various | Sub-$1,500 options with extra features praised highly |

## DIY Kits and Projects

### Recommended Kit Manufacturers

| Manufacturer | Products | Difficulty | Community Notes |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| [[DIYRE]] (DIY Recording Equipment) | 500-series modules, colour format | Beginner-Intermediate | Bryan DiMaio is "a big fan of the DIYRE kit" |
| [[Hairball Audio]] | 1176 Rev D clone, other classics | Intermediate-Advanced | Well-documented builds |
| [[Microphone Parts]] (micparts.com) | Condenser mic kits and mods | Intermediate | Matt McGlynn provides excellent support. Fox 460 and V-251 circuits discussed |

### Popular DIY Projects

#### Microphone Modifications
- **Carvin CTM100 conversion** -- Swap guts with Microphone Parts circuits to create a U47-style or 251-style mic for a fraction of the cost
- **ART MPA modifications** -- Opamp swaps, component upgrades, JJ tube replacements. A fun project that genuinely improves a budget preamp
- **Chinese condenser upgrades** -- Capsule and circuit swaps in inexpensive large-diaphragm condensers

> [!quote] Matt McGlynn (via shaunobi)
> "The V-251 circuit is easier to build, and is more similar to the U47 circuit than is the Fox 460 circuit. On low-volume sources, the two circuits sound the same, because the sound of any condenser mic mostly comes from the capsule. On louder sources, the V-251 circuit has more saturation."

#### Cable Building
- Most cost-effective DIY project for immediate studio benefit
- Mogami and Canare bulk cable with Neutrik connectors is the community standard
- Custom cable lengths eliminate clutter and reduce noise floor

## The Ethics of Clones

### Community Perspective
The channel has discussed the broader implications of the clone/acquisition market:
- Companies building affordable clones democratize access to classic sounds
- Concern about market consolidation and "enshittification" when small companies get acquired
- The best clone manufacturers bring their own innovations, not just copies
- Vintage originals maintain value partly because of mystique, not just measurable superiority

> [!quote] kieronmenzies
> "The goal of the company should not be to eventually sell off and get absorbed by the highest bidder. The goal should be to set up a profitable business that provides competitive goods and/or services."

## Common Debates

### Clones vs Originals
- **Clones are "good enough"** for the vast majority of applications
- **Originals have vintage iron and components** that cannot be perfectly replicated with modern parts
- **The difference narrows** as clone manufacturers improve quality
- **For recording**: The source, performance, and room matter far more than clone vs original

### DIY vs Factory-Built
- DIY saves money but costs time; worthwhile if you enjoy the process
- Factory-built clones (Warm, Heritage) offer consistency and warranty
- DIY teaches you how your gear works, which helps with troubleshooting and maintenance
- Some DIY builds (well-executed 1176 clones) can rival or exceed factory clones

## Recommended Gear

| Category | Budget DIY | Mid-Range Clone | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Preamp | DIYRE 500-series kit | [[Warm Audio WA-73]] | DIYRE teaches fundamentals |
| Compressor | Hairball 1176 Rev D kit | [[Warm Audio WA-76]] | The Hairball is a serious build |
| Microphone | Microphone Parts capsule swap | [[Warm Audio WA-87]] | Mic modding is rewarding |
| EQ | DIYRE colour modules | [[Warm Audio EQP-WA]] | Start with colour format |
| Cables | Mogami bulk + Neutrik | -- | Everyone should make cables |

## Tips from the Community

- Start with cable building and repair before attempting electronics projects
- Invest in a proper soldering station -- the $20 difference between a loose iron and a station saves enormous frustration
- Read the full build documentation before ordering parts
- Join DIY audio forums (GroupDIY, etc.) for support during builds
- **ChatGPT and AI tools can be misleading for technical audio questions** -- shaunobi confirmed that Matt McGlynn said "The text quoted from my website is correct. Everything else is wrong" about a ChatGPT Deep Research query on mic circuits
- When buying used vintage gear, factor in recap and maintenance costs

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting too ambitious** -- Build cables and simple kits before attempting a full 1176 clone
- **Cheaping out on solder and tools** -- Bad solder and a poor iron create unreliable joints
- **Not ventilating** when using lead solder
- **Trusting AI-generated technical information** about circuit design without verification
- **Expecting a $300 clone to sound identical** to a $3,000 original -- appreciate it for what it is
- **Not testing thoroughly** after building -- always verify with test tones and signal measurements
