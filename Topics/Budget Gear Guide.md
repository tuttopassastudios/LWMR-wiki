# Budget Gear Guide

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> One of the most frequently discussed topics in #gear-talk: how to get professional-quality results without spending professional-level money. This guide synthesizes hundreds of community recommendations across every gear category, organized by price tier. The core philosophy: spend wisely on what matters most (monitoring, room treatment, microphones) before chasing expensive outboard.

## Community Consensus

- **Monitoring and room treatment come first** -- This is the single most repeated piece of advice in the channel. As cian riordan put it: "because consumer gear & plugins are so damn good at the entry level, [the priority] is almost always monitoring & room treatment"
- **Modern budget gear is remarkably capable** -- Interface preamps from Focusrite, Audient, and UAD are more than adequate for most work
- **Buy used aggressively** -- Reverb, eBay, and local shops are gold mines. Patience pays off enormously
- **Prioritize one great piece over many mediocre ones** -- Better to have one excellent microphone than a locker of cheap ones
- **Plugins have largely caught up** to outboard for mixing, making ITB mixing viable at any budget level

## Priority Order for Studio Investment

The community consistently recommends this upgrade path:

1. **Room treatment / acoustic panels** ($500-1,000)
2. **Monitors** + proper placement
3. **Microphones** (one or two great ones)
4. **Interface / conversion** (adequate is fine)
5. **Preamps** (your interface preamps are probably fine)
6. **Outboard processing** (last priority for most people)

## Budget Microphones

### Large Diaphragm Condensers

| Mic | Price Range | Best For | Community Notes |
|-----|------------|----------|-----------------|
| [[Shure KSM32]] | ~$500 | Vocals, acoustic, cabs, drums | "The star of the show" -- handles sibilance better than most budget mics. SoundsLikeJoe beat a Grammy engineer's $40k vocal chain with this mic |
| [[Austrian Audio OC18]] | ~$850 | Vocals, guitar amp, kick, acoustic | "If I had to get ONE mic I'd get that. Way better than an AKG 414 ULS/XLS" -- Zack Hames. Designed by original C12 capsule designers |
| [[Austrian Audio OC818]] | ~$1,200 | Multi-pattern versatility | Dual-output, stunning on everything |
| [[Warm Audio WA-47jr]] | ~$300 | Kick drum, bass cab | Solid low end without distortion; clean but not "rich" |
| [[Warm Audio WA-87]] | ~$350 | Vocals | Community-approved Neumann clone |
| [[Warm Audio WA-251]] | ~$400 | Vocals | Frequently praised for the price |
| [[AT4033]] | ~$350 | Vocals, instruments | "Solid workhorse" -- cian riordan |

### Dynamic Microphones

| Mic | Price Range | Best For | Community Notes |
|-----|------------|----------|-----------------|
| [[Shure SM7B]] | ~$400 | Vocals, guitar cabs | Ubiquitous. Works best with a good preamp or Cloudlifter. Pair with a Distressor for incredible results |
| [[Shure SM57]] | ~$100 | Everything | The desert island mic. Buy several |
| [[Shure SM58]] | ~$100 | Vocals, live | Indestructible. Still sounds great on records |
| [[Sennheiser MD421]] | ~$400 | Toms, guitar cabs, vocals | Classic for a reason |

### Ribbon Microphones

| Mic | Price Range | Best For | Community Notes |
|-----|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Budget ribbons | $100-300 | Guitar cabs, room sound | Several members use inexpensive Chinese ribbons to good effect |

## Budget Interfaces and Conversion

| Interface | Price Range | Channel Count | Community Notes |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| [[Focusrite Scarlett]] series | $150-500 | 2-18 | Solid entry point, millions of records made on these |
| [[Focusrite Saffire 56]] | Used ~$200 | 56 | "So many producers are still running the Saffire 56" -- legacy workhorse |
| [[Audient iD series]] | $200-500 | 2-20 | Clean preamps, great value |
| [[Universal Audio Apollo]] | $600-2,500 | 2-16+ | The most popular "step up" -- UAD plugins are the main draw |
| [[SPL Crimson]] | ~$500 | Multi | Capable monitoring section |

> [!tip] Community Advice
> Do not obsess over converter quality at the entry level. "Distortion is below perception in all but the cheapest converters, frequency response is ruler flat from DC-Nyquist" -- David Fuller

## Budget Preamps

| Preamp | Price Range | Character | Community Notes |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| [[Focusrite ISA One/Two]] | $300-500 | Transformer-based, clean | "Better than stock preamps in the focusrite or audient or UAD offerings" -- Zack Hames |
| [[Joe Meek Twin Q2]] | ~$300 | Transformer, thick | 2-channel with basic EQ and compression. "Super transformer vibes, very thick sounding" |
| [[ART Pro MPA]] | ~$250 | Tube (sort of) | Moddable; gain is solid state with tube color circuit. Fun project piece |
| [[Warm Audio WA-73]] | ~$500 | Neve-style | Solid 1073 clone for the money |
| Your interface preamps | $0 | Clean/transparent | Honestly fine for 90% of work |

> [!quote] cian riordan
> "As quality preamps have become cheaper and more accessible, the outboard mic-pre as a concept has become less of a limiting factor to achieving quality recorded sounds."

## Budget Compressors

| Compressor | Price Range | Type | Community Notes |
|------------|------------|------|-----------------|
| [[Warm Audio WA-76]] | ~$600 | FET (1176 clone) | Multiple members own and endorse |
| [[Klark Teknik 76-KT]] | ~$300 | FET (1176 clone) | Controversial quality but functional |
| SSL-style bus comp clones | $500-1,500 | VCA | "Cannot recommend enough" -- praised for extra features like ratio and sidechain solo |
| [[Empirical Labs Distressor]] | ~$1,500 | Digital/analog hybrid | Not exactly "budget" but considered the best single compressor investment. Does everything |

## Budget EQs

| EQ | Price Range | Type | Community Notes |
|----|------------|------|-----------------|
| [[Warm Audio EQP-WA]] | ~$400 | Pultec clone | Decent for the money |
| Plugin EQs | $0-200 | ITB | FabFilter Pro-Q, stock DAW EQs are genuinely excellent |

## Budget Monitoring

| Monitor | Price Range | Community Notes |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| [[Yamaha HS8]] / [[Yamaha HS80M]] | $300-500/pair | Longtime community favorite. Multiple members have used them for years professionally |
| [[Yamaha NS-10]] | Used $300-600 | The classic. Still relevant for midrange translation |
| [[Amphion One18]] | ~$2,500/pair | Not budget, but frequently cited as the upgrade that changed everything |
| [[Sennheiser HD650]] / [[Sennheiser HD600]] | $200-350 | Best value reference headphones |
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-M50x]] | ~$150 | Ubiquitous closed-back option |
| [[Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro]] | ~$150 | Open-back alternative |

> [!important]
> Headphone impedance matching matters. "Most entry level interfaces don't power low impedance headphones too well (150 ohms below). For some reason they can power high impedance headphones well."

## Budget DI Boxes

| DI | Price Range | Type | Community Notes |
|----|------------|------|-----------------|
| [[Radial JDI]] | ~$200 | Passive | Community standard |
| [[Radial J48]] | ~$200 | Active | Best for pedal chains |
| [[Rupert Neve Designs RNDI]] | ~$270 | Active | "Loved the J48 until I had the RNDI" -- NoahNeedleman |
| [[Countryman Type 85]] | ~$200 | Active | Reliable studio standard |

## Budget Power and Utilities

| Item | Price Range | Community Notes |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| [[Furman]] rack power conditioner | $50-150 | "Just get one with a switch on the front" -- basic Furman is all you need |
| Pyle rack power strip | ~$30 | cian riordan: "Nothing fancy, works great" |
| Patch bay | $50-200 | Essential for routing flexibility once you have outboard |

## Buying Used -- Tips

- **Reverb.com** is the community's preferred marketplace for used pro audio
- **Sweetwater and Vintage King** both offer financing/payment plans
- Be patient -- deals come in waves. "If you're patient, you'll find a combo of bells and snare from the 90s that some parent is selling for $100" -- Eric Martin
- Always try to buy gear that holds value so you can sell without losing much
- Factor in potential maintenance costs for vintage gear

## The "One Mic" Question

If the community had to recommend a single microphone for someone starting out:

1. **[[Austrian Audio OC18]]** -- The most versatile single mic recommendation
2. **[[Shure SM57]]** -- If budget is extremely tight
3. **[[Shure KSM32]]** -- Excellent all-rounder that punches way above its price

## Amp Simulation on a Budget

| Software | Price Range | Community Notes |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| [[Neural DSP]] plugins | $100-150 each | "Everyone's been loving Neural DSP" -- community favorite for guitar tones |
| [[Neural DSP Cory Wong]] | ~$100 | "For clean fender type stuff, Cory Wong is the best I've heard ITB" -- popaganda |
| [[Helix Native]] | ~$400 | Full-featured modeler |
| [[IK Multimedia AmpliTube]] | $150-300 | Mixed reviews -- cab sims are the weak point. "Amplitube is quite woofy in general" -- David Fuller |

> [!quote] popaganda
> "Bang for the buck is overrated. Find a couple sounds that work. With cleaner tones it's really all about the transient... does the modeler respect your transients?"

## Common Mistakes

- **Buying preamps before treating your room** -- The single most common misallocation of budget
- **Chasing "the sound" through gear** when the issue is performance, arrangement, or room acoustics
- **Buying too many cheap things** instead of one or two excellent things
- **Ignoring the used market** -- Pro audio gear holds value well and used units are often indistinguishable from new
- **Upgrading converters before monitors** -- You will not hear converter differences through budget monitors in an untreated room
- **Assuming expensive = better for your situation** -- A $200 SM57 may genuinely outperform a $3,000 condenser on certain sources

## Budget Studio Builds from #show-your-setup

The setup channel provides real evidence of budget-friendly studio solutions:

### DIY Desk Builds
- **bobby k's $100 desk** — Sold his Output Platform and built a replacement from scrap wood. "Noticeably better, plus feels good to get that money back" (9 reactions). Acoustically superior due to reduced reflective surface area.
- **Josh Bowman's weekend renovation** — Repurposed old wood and a closet shelf into a minimal desk after REW measurements showed dramatic improvement without the big desk.
- **The tiny desk consensus** — Multiple members confirm that downsizing furniture and investing in treatment produces better results than expensive studio desks.

### Affordable Treatment
- **AYOSHADOW's DIY panels** — Handmade acoustic treatment built as a family project for a living room studio
- **EliHeathMusic's wheeled panels** — DIY rolling bass traps with accessible construction plans shared with the community
- **Will Melones' corner treatment** — Simple rockwool wedge at ceiling/front-wall junction yielded +6dB improvement at 135Hz
- **bobby k's $200 double-paned window** — Found a gas-insulated, double-paned window (new $1,700) for his garage studio conversion

### Budget Monitor Options
- Community setup photos document successful mixes on Adam A7Xs (jantrit, 11 years), Kali speakers (discussed as upgrade recommendations), and other affordable monitors paired with proper treatment.
