# Studio Design and Setup

## Overview

> [!abstract]
> A comprehensive guide to designing, building, and optimizing production environments — from bedroom setups to purpose-built studios. Drawn primarily from the #show-your-setup channel, where 260 community members share photos, build progress, and hard-won lessons about creating functional workspaces. This page covers room layout, speaker placement, acoustic treatment integration, furniture choices, ergonomics, lighting, and cable management as a unified discipline.

## Community Consensus

- **Smaller desk = better sound** — The community has strongly converged on minimizing desk size to reduce reflections and improve monitor imaging. Multiple members (Josh Bowman, masteredbyjack, nachomaquieira) report dramatic REW measurement improvements after downsizing.
- **Treatment before gear** — Spending on [[Acoustic Treatment Guide|acoustic treatment]] before upgrading monitors or outboard is the community's #1 recommendation for improving mix quality.
- **Accessibility drives usage** — "I only use the stuff that I can access quickly" (P.K. Stephan) is a widely shared philosophy. Gear that requires setup time tends to collect dust.
- **The studio is never "done"** — A running joke and truth. LAPhill: "I'm going to run out of reasons not to call this studio 'done' soon."

## Room Layout and Speaker Placement

### The Mix Position

The mix position is the single most important design decision. Community guidelines:

- **38% rule** — Place the listening position at approximately 38% of the room's length from the front wall to minimize modal interference
- **Symmetry is non-negotiable** — Left/right symmetry for speakers and treatment is critical for stereo imaging
- **Speaker height** — Tweeters at ear height when seated, angled slightly down if on stands
- **Equilateral triangle** — Speaker-to-speaker distance should equal speaker-to-listener distance

### The Tiny Desk Movement

A defining trend in the community. Members consistently report that oversized studio furniture creates acoustic problems:

- **bobby k** built a $100 DIY desk after selling his Output Platform — "noticeably better, plus feels good to get that money back"
- **masteredbyjack** had to have his custom desk cut down during his Unf*ck build after Nomograph Mastering (Ruairi) flagged it as too large
- **nachomaquieira** moved from a big desk to a side rack with PMC 6s — "No more big desk, moved to side rack"
- **thegreatcarsoni** converted to a tiny desk setup for better acoustic performance

> "I love this trend towards people minimizing their cockpit layout and putting time into real, meaningful bass trapping." — cian riordan, #show-your-setup, 2022-06-11

### Screen Placement

Screens between speakers create reflections. Community strategies:
- **Side-saddle** — Rollmottle moved screen behind and to the right, working in the sweet spot
- **Below speaker line** — Keep screens below the acoustic axis between speakers
- **Monitor arms** — Allow repositioning screens out of the acoustic path when mixing critically

## Studio Builds

The community has documented several major studio construction projects in real-time:

### Eric Martin's Commercial Studio Build
- Purchased a commercial building (2023-07) and documented the full journey from concrete block to finished studio
- 6 months in bureaucratic limbo before construction approval
- Built from exterior concrete block with proper treatment — "nearing the finish line of the very difficult part of building a studio from exterior concrete block and a roof into a finished space"
- Passed all department of safety inspections (2024-06-21) with Gerhard Westphalen design treatment still to come

### peterlabberton's Studio House
- Building a combined studio/small house from the ground up
- Broke ground (2025-02-12) with tielines to the living room and a full Gerhard Westphalen acoustic build
- "Permits and construction take a long ass time!" (2026-02-06) — still finishing rockwool installation

### Zack Hames' Trident/SSL Studio
- Bought a house (2023-03) and enlisted the Discord community to help plan a basement build-out
- Installed a Trident 24 console during construction
- Later acquired an SSL 6040 E (2025-10-15, 52 reactions — the most-reacted gear post in the channel)
- Completed Gerhard Westphalen room design with diaphragmatic membrane absorbers — "I don't understand how these diaphragmatic membrane absorbers work… but damn do they work!"
- "And we are live!!!! She's a beaut. Thanks everyone for going on this ride with me." (2026-01-06)

### masteredbyjack's Basement Mastering Room
- Built in basement: 13ft long x 30ft wide x 8ft tall
- Designed by Nomograph Mastering (Ruairi): entire ceiling stuffed with 9" pink fluffy, rockwool in walls, tuned mass loaded vinyl, 6" Safe'n'Sound back wall with friction-fit frame
- Wall finishes are acoustic felt board — absorptive with no reflections
- Hard front wall proved "far superior" to soft felt front wall — room was too dead with absorption everywhere

### denimes' Home Studio
- Multilayer absorption: 1ft thick side walls, 2.5ft thick rear, 6in ceiling
- Custom 3-way mains with Hypex amps
- Detailed construction photos and REW measurements shared with community

### Gerhard Westphalen as Community Acoustician

Gerhard Westphalen has emerged as the community's go-to acoustic designer, with multiple members commissioning room designs:
- bobby k, Adam Thein, Eric Martin, Zack Hames, Jasper Boogaard, jonmatteson all credit Gerhard for designs
- Specializes in membrane absorbers, ceiling clouds, and comprehensive room treatment plans

> [!quote] Discord Source
> "I'm so tired but the final panel went up today! Thank you to @Gerhard Westphalen for the design help. And more broadly I wouldn't have ever found my way to this result without being on this server." — Adam Thein, #show-your-setup, 2023-08-10 (27 reactions)

## Rental vs. Owned Studio Trade-offs

### For Renters: Portable Treatment
- **[[Attack Wall|Attack walls]]** and [[ASC Tube Trap|tube traps]] — Portable, no permanent modification required
- **jantrit's DIY attack wall** — "Changed my mixing life absolutely. Came to be when I was looking for a portable solution, working in this rented space. I didn't want to invest in a proper build out and lose the space so everything here can be packed up and moved."
- **Wheeled bass traps** — EliHeathMusic designed rolling panels on wheels for closet access: "huge improvement sonically and still gives me access to the closet"
- **GIK panels** — Free-standing acoustic panels that don't require wall mounting

### For Owners: Permanent Treatment
- **Built-in treatment** — masteredbyjack's ceiling stuffed with 9" insulation, rockwool in walls
- **Floated floors and double walls** — For serious isolation
- **Custom-built frames** — bobby k's back wall bass trap frame, peterlabberton's rockwool studio build

## Ergonomics and Workflow

### Desk Depth and Reach
- Keep frequently used gear within arm's reach
- Side racks keep outboard accessible without adding desk surface area between you and speakers
- Patchbays should be reachable from the seated position

### Cable Management and Workflow Design
LAPhill's studio wiring overhaul (by Tim O'Sullivan) exemplifies thoughtful workflow:
- All pedals, synths, and preamps wired to patchbays for flexible routing
- MIDI-over-Ethernet (Mio units) for reliable clock distribution
- Headphone connections routed to convenient positions (right side of desk, by piano)
- Ready-to-go cables pre-plugged at instrument positions

### Machine Room Isolation
- Separate noisy computers from the listening environment
- P.K. Stephan's approach: MADI and AES/EBU conversion with everything always connected and mic'd up

## DIY Furniture and Budget Solutions

- **bobby k's $100 desk** — Built from scrap wood after selling an Output Platform, acoustically superior
- **Josh Bowman's closet-shelf desk** — Repurposed old wood and a closet shelf during a weekend renovation
- **EliHeathMusic's wheeled bass traps** — DIY rolling panels for rental-friendly treatment with closet access
- **AYOSHADOW's handmade panels** — Acoustic treatment built with his father as a family project

> [!quote] Discord Source
> "New mixing desk I built after selling my output platform. Noticeably better, plus feels good to get that money back (this cost me under $100)." — bobby k, #show-your-setup, 2021-10-20

## Studio Lighting and Aesthetics

Lighting is the most discussed non-acoustic element of studio design. The community balances vibe with function:

- **Indirect/ambient lighting** preferred over harsh overhead fluorescents
- **LED strips and RGB** — Popular for mood setting during sessions
- **Curtains** — herbie's curtain installation dramatically opened up the room feel
- **Vibe as a session tool** — "I don't feel like any of these pictures fully capture the vibe yet" (popaganda.) reflects the community's view that studio aesthetics affect creative energy

### Practical Lighting Tips
- Avoid lights that create screen glare at the mix position
- Dimmable options for tracking sessions vs. mixing
- Consider color temperature — warm lighting for creative sessions, neutral for critical listening

## Hybrid Studio Integration

The community extensively documents hybrid setups that bridge analog and digital:

- **P.K. Stephan's hybrid rig** — XLR patchbay for recording paths, Dangerous Liaison for mixbus/mastering gear, MADI/AES conversion, everything always connected
- **LAPhill's pedal/synth integration** — Patchbay routing for flexible analog signal flow with DAW clock sync
- **Side rack philosophy** — Move outboard to side racks instead of desk-mounted units for better acoustics

> [!quote] Discord Source
> "I like having everything connected and mic'ed up because I notice that I only use the stuff that I can access quickly while producing/mixing." — P.K. Stephan, #show-your-setup, 2022-09-06

## Mobile and Unconventional Setups

- **Eric Martin's checked-bag studio** — Mac Studio, Apollo x4, Genelec 8020s, multiple mics, headphones and cabling all in a Pelican Air 1615
- **kylem's truck-powered studio** — Electric company cut power, ran entire studio rig off truck battery for 6 estimated days
- **noahc's Hawaii mixing room** — "Plz hit me up when y'all need a getaway!"
- **kidcutler's barn studio** — Neighbor's barn repurposed as a tracking space

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting with gear instead of room** — Buying expensive monitors before treating the room
- **Oversized furniture** — Large desks between speakers and listener destroy imaging
- **Ignoring the back wall** — Front-of-room treatment without rear bass trapping leaves low-end problems
- **Skipping measurements** — Not using [[REW]] before and after treatment changes
- **Over-deadening** — masteredbyjack's experience: soft front wall made the room "too dead, uncomfortable" — hard front wall restored depth and energy
- **Aesthetics over acoustics** — Making treatment decisions based on looks rather than measurements
