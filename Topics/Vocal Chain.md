# Vocal Chain

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> The vocal recording chain -- microphone, preamp, compressor, and any processing on the way in -- is one of the most discussed and debated signal paths in audio production. This guide synthesizes community recommendations on mic selection, preamp pairing, compression during tracking, and the philosophy of committing to sounds at the source.

## Community Consensus

- **The singer matters more than the chain** -- Technique, performance, and mic placement outweigh gear choices
- **Match the mic to the voice**, not to the price tag -- A $500 mic may outperform a $5,000 mic on a given vocalist
- **Commit to compression during tracking** when you know what you are doing -- it shapes the performance
- **The "default" chain** (U87 → Neve 1073 → LA-2A) is a cliche for a reason, but it is not the only path
- **Budget chains can compete** -- The community has multiple stories of inexpensive chains beating expensive ones

## The Chain That Beat a Grammy Engineer

> [!quote] SoundsLikeJoe
> "She finished production and went into vocals... AND HATED IT. They had huge mics going into a HUGE vocal chain... like $40k worth of stuff. They tried C800 and another thing or two. She hated it. Called me and said 'I gotta come back and do my vocals there.' What was I using? A Shure KSM32 into a Buzz Audio ARC1.1 strip."

This story encapsulates the community's philosophy: the right chain for the voice beats the expensive chain every time. The Grammy engineer's response -- "What the fuck are you using man? You can't use that. Those mics are terrible." -- reveals how assumptions about gear can mislead.

## Vocal Microphone Recommendations

### Budget to Mid-Range

| Mic | Type | Price | Community Notes |
|-----|------|-------|-----------------|
| [[Shure KSM32]] | LDC | ~$500 | "The star" -- handles sibilance well, works on everything |
| [[Shure SM7B]] | Dynamic | ~$400 | Pairs brilliantly with a [[Distressor]] (6:1, slow attack). Works best with loud, confident vocalists |
| [[Austrian Audio OC18]] | LDC | ~$850 | Exceptional vocal mic, designed by C12 capsule engineers |
| [[Warm Audio WA-87]] | LDC | ~$350 | Solid U87 clone |
| [[Warm Audio WA-251]] | LDC | ~$400 | Praised for vocals at its price |
| [[AT4033]] | LDC | ~$350 | "Solid workhorse" |

### High-End
| Mic | Type | Price | Community Notes |
|-----|------|-------|-----------------|
| [[Sony C800G]] | Tube LDC | $8,000+ | Hip-hop and pop standard; not universally loved |
| [[Neumann U87]] | LDC | $3,200+ | The default. Not always the best choice |
| [[Neumann U47]] | Tube LDC | Vintage | The Holy Grail for many |
| [[AKG C12]] / variants | Tube LDC | Vintage | Legendary warmth |
| [[Telefunken ELA M 251]] | Tube LDC | $10,000+ | Bright, detailed, expensive |

### Ribbon Mics for Vocals
- [[RCA 44]] -- cian riordan's pick for ribbon vocals
- Coles 4038 / KU3A -- "If it's a good one"
- Ribbons work beautifully on singers with harsh or sibilant voices

## Preamp Pairing

| Preamp | Character | Best Pairing | Community Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| [[Neve 1073]] / clones | Warm, thick, transformer color | Thinner voices that need body | Classic pairing with any vocal mic |
| [[Buzz Audio ARC1.1]] | Channel strip with EQ/comp | All-in-one solution | SoundsLikeJoe's chain of choice |
| [[Ampex 350/351]] | Big tube sound, musical distortion | When you want TONE | "If I could have one pre to record everything for the rest of my life, this would be it" -- cian riordan |
| [[API 512]] | Punchy, midrange-forward | Vocals that need to cut | Great for aggressive performances |
| [[Focusrite ISA]] | Clean, transformer-based | Transparent with subtle warmth | Best "budget pro" option |
| Interface preamps | Clean/transparent | When the mic is doing the work | Genuinely adequate for most vocal work |

## Compression During Tracking

### The SM7B + Distressor Trick
> [!quote] Josh
> "He's literally just running the SM7 through the Distressor on the input. 6:1 ratio, slow attack. The slow attack helps prevent plosives from pumping."

This combination produces polished, controlled vocals from an affordable dynamic mic. The key insight: the slow attack lets transients through while the 6:1 ratio provides consistent level control.

### General Tracking Compression Approach
- **Light compression** (2-4 dB of gain reduction) is safe and recommended during tracking
- **Slow attack** preserves vocal transients and natural dynamics
- **Fast release** keeps the compressor from holding down the signal between phrases
- **Commit to the sound** -- If you are using hardware compression during tracking, print it. Do not try to undo it later

### When to Skip Tracking Compression
- When the vocalist has excellent dynamic control
- When you are unsure of the arrangement and want maximum flexibility
- When the compressor is adding artifacts you do not want

## The "Right" Vocal Chain

There is no universal answer. The community's approach:

1. **Listen to the vocalist** -- Record a test with 2-3 microphones if possible
2. **Choose the mic that flatters the voice**, not the most expensive one
3. **Add preamp character if needed** -- Some voices need warmth, others need clarity
4. **Compress only if you know what you are doing** -- Light gain reduction is usually safe
5. **Focus on mic placement** -- Distance, angle, and pop filter placement matter enormously

## Tips from the Community

- Record vocal tests with different mics before committing to a session's vocal chain
- The [[Shure KSM32]] handles sibilance better than most mics in its price range -- consider it before buying de-esser plugins
- If a vocalist sounds harsh through a condenser, try a ribbon or dynamic mic instead of reaching for EQ
- Mic distance matters more than mic choice in many cases -- a vocalist eating the mic sounds fundamentally different from one at 8-12 inches
- Do not be afraid to use "cheap" mics -- kidcutler did half of rapper Lucki's first project on a KSM32 and it matched seamlessly with the other half recorded through a vintage 87/Avalon/LA-2A chain

## Common Mistakes

- **Defaulting to the "industry standard" chain** without testing alternatives on the actual vocalist
- **Over-compressing during tracking** -- You cannot undo this
- **Ignoring room acoustics** -- The best vocal chain in an untreated room sounds worse than a budget chain in a treated one
- **Placing the mic too close** for vocalists who are not experienced with mic technique
- **Not recording a DI/clean take** for safety alongside the processed version
- **Spending $5,000 on a microphone** before investing in room treatment and monitoring
