# Acoustic Treatment Guide

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Acoustic treatment is consistently cited as the single most important investment an audio engineer can make. The community places it above microphones, preamps, converters, and even monitors in the priority chain. This guide covers why treatment matters, what to prioritize, DIY vs professional options, and common myths.

## Community Consensus

- **Acoustic treatment is the #1 priority** -- Mentioned in virtually every "what should I buy" thread
- **You cannot make good mixing decisions in a bad room** -- No amount of gear compensates for poor acoustics
- **$500-1,000 of treatment provides enormous returns** -- You do not need to spend a fortune
- **Bass trapping is the most important and most neglected** element of room treatment
- **Treatment is NOT soundproofing** -- These are different problems requiring different solutions
- **DIY panels are cost-effective** and produce professional results

> [!quote] Slow Hand
> "If you're working as an audio engineer or producer or mastering engineer, my vote is that you spend a fraction of that to invest in getting your room dialed in with some acoustic treatment. The dividends it will pay by budgeting just $500 or $1000 will be enormous. It will affect all of your future productions in a positive way."

## Priority of Treatment

### The Community's Investment Hierarchy
1. **Acoustic treatment and speaker positioning** -- First and most impactful
2. **Quality monitors**
3. **Monitor controller signal path**
4. **DAC quality**
5. Everything else

### What to Treat First
1. **First reflection points** -- Side walls, ceiling, and rear wall at the mix position
2. **Bass traps** -- Corners of the room (floor-to-ceiling)
3. **Rear wall** -- Behind the listening position
4. **Front wall** -- Around and behind speakers (if possible)

## Treatment Types

### Absorption
- **Broadband absorbers**: Rigid fiberglass or mineral wool panels (2-4" thick) mounted on walls
- **Bass traps**: Thick absorption (4-6"+) in corners, or membrane/resonant absorbers
- **Ceiling clouds**: Suspended panels above the mix position

### Diffusion
- **Diffusers**: Scatter sound energy rather than absorbing it
- **Best used on rear walls** where you want to preserve liveliness without flutter echoes
- **Not a replacement for absorption** -- Treat first reflections before adding diffusion

### What NOT to Do
- **Foam tiles** (Auralex-style) are mostly ineffective for low frequencies and over-damp high frequencies
- **Egg cartons** do virtually nothing
- **Covering every surface** creates an unnaturally dead room
- **Treating only high frequencies** without addressing bass buildup

## DIY Treatment

### DIY Panel Construction
The community endorses DIY panels as highly cost-effective:

| Material | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Rigid fiberglass (OC 703/705) | $30-50 per panel | The standard absorber material. 2" for mid/high, 4" for broadband |
| Mineral wool (Rockwool Safe'n'Sound) | $10-20 per panel | More affordable alternative to fiberglass, widely available |
| Fabric covering | $5-15 per panel | Acoustically transparent fabric (burlap, speaker cloth) |
| Wood framing | $5-15 per panel | 1x4 or 1x3 lumber for frames |

**Total DIY cost per panel**: approximately $30-60 depending on size and material

### Panel Placement Guide
- **Side walls**: Place at first reflection points (use the mirror trick -- sit in your mix position and have someone slide a mirror along the wall; where you can see the speaker in the mirror is the first reflection point)
- **Ceiling**: Directly above the mix position, between speakers and listener
- **Corners**: Floor-to-ceiling bass traps (stack panels or use purpose-built corner traps)
- **Rear wall**: Absorption and/or diffusion

## Professional Treatment Options

| Manufacturer | Products | Price Range | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| GIK Acoustics | Panels, bass traps, diffusers | $50-500 per panel | Excellent value, community-recommended |
| Primacoustic | Panel systems | $50-400 per panel | Clean aesthetic, easy mounting |
| ATS Acoustics | Budget panels | $30-200 per panel | Good entry point |
| Custom installations | Room-specific designs | $5,000+ | For dedicated control rooms |

## Measurement and Analysis

### Room Measurement Tools
- **REW (Room EQ Wizard)** -- Free software for room analysis
- **Measurement microphone** (Dayton Audio UMM-6, miniDSP UMIK-1) -- ~$75-100
- Measure BEFORE and AFTER treatment to verify improvements
- Focus on frequency response flatness and decay times

### What Good Treatment Achieves
- Flatter frequency response at the listening position
- Reduced flutter echoes and standing waves
- Shorter and more even RT60 (reverb time)
- More accurate stereo imaging
- Mixes that translate better to other systems

## Common Debates

### DIY vs Commercial Panels
- **DIY**: Significantly cheaper, customizable sizes, requires construction skills
- **Commercial**: Cleaner aesthetic, consistent quality, no construction needed
- **Community verdict**: DIY provides better value if you can do the work; commercial panels for those who cannot or prefer a polished look

### How Much Treatment Is Enough?
- **Too little**: Room still dominates your monitoring
- **Too much**: Room sounds dead and lifeless; fatiguing to work in
- **Right amount**: Controlled reflections, even bass response, natural feel
- A mix room should feel "tight" but not "dead"

### Room Correction Software
- [[Sonarworks]] (SoundID) and [[IK Multimedia ARC]] can compensate for room issues in headphones/monitors
- **Not a replacement for treatment** -- Software cannot fix early reflections, flutter echoes, or timing issues
- Useful as a supplement to physical treatment

## Tips from the Community

- **Start with the mirror trick** for first reflection points -- It is the single easiest way to identify where to place panels
- **$500 in DIY panels will transform your room** more than $5,000 in microphones
- **Thick panels work better** -- 4" broadband absorbers handle a wider frequency range than 2" panels
- **Air gaps behind panels** increase their effective thickness for low-frequency absorption
- **Do not neglect the ceiling** -- First reflections from the ceiling are just as important as from walls
- Slow Hand offers to help community members plan treatment via DM

## Common Mistakes

- **Buying gear before treating the room** -- The most universal mistake in audio
- **Using foam tiles as primary treatment** -- They absorb high frequencies but not the problematic low frequencies
- **Over-treating and creating a dead room** -- You need some natural ambience
- **Treating symmetrically without measurement** -- Every room is different; measure to verify
- **Ignoring bass buildup** -- Low-frequency issues are the hardest to hear and the most damaging to mix decisions
- **Placing monitors against the wall without treatment** -- Creates massive bass buildup
- **Assuming treatment = soundproofing** -- Treatment controls sound within a room; soundproofing prevents sound from entering/leaving
