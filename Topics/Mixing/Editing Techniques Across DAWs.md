# Editing Techniques Across DAWs

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> Audio editing workflows vary significantly across DAWs, with each platform offering distinct strengths. [[Pro Tools]] remains the industry standard for detailed audio editing with features like Tab to Transient and Beat Detective, while [[Ableton Live]] excels at non-destructive clip-based workflows. Community members frequently share cross-DAW techniques for crossfading, comping, time stretching, and transient editing.

## Detail

### Crossfading and Fades
Crossfade techniques are essential for clean edits across all DAWs. [[Pro Tools]] offers precise crossfade editing with a dedicated Fades dialog, while [[Ableton Live]] uses simple drag handles on clip edges. [[Logic Pro]] provides a dedicated Fade tool. Members stress the importance of using equal-power crossfades for musical transitions and equal-gain crossfades for speech or dialog editing.

### Time Stretching and Flex
Time manipulation is handled differently across platforms. [[Pro Tools]] uses Elastic Audio with multiple algorithms (polyphonic, rhythmic, monophonic, X-Form), while [[Logic Pro]] offers Flex Time with similar algorithm choices. [[Ableton Live]]'s warp modes (Beats, Tones, Texture, Complex, Complex Pro) are considered among the most intuitive. Members caution that heavy time stretching introduces artifacts regardless of DAW.

### Comping Workflows
Comping (assembling the best take from multiple recordings) varies widely. [[Pro Tools]] uses Playlists with swipe comping, [[Logic Pro]] offers Take Folders with Quick Swipe Comping, and [[Ableton Live]] provides a take lane system introduced in later versions. [[Reaper]] allows highly customizable comping with its flexible take system. Members note that [[Pro Tools]] and [[Logic Pro]] have the most efficient comping workflows for vocal production.

### Strip Silence and Transient Editing
[[Pro Tools]]' Strip Silence and Tab to Transient remain gold-standard editing features. Beat Detective is widely used for drum editing and alignment. [[Logic Pro]]'s Strip Silence equivalent and [[Ableton Live]]'s transient markers offer similar functionality but with different interaction models. Members working on drum editing frequently recommend dedicated tools like [[Sound Radix]] Drum Leveler alongside DAW-native features.

### DAW-Specific Editing Strengths
Each DAW has particular editing strengths valued by the community:
- **[[Pro Tools]]:** Tab to Transient, Beat Detective, Playlist comping, nudge shortcuts
- **[[Logic Pro]]:** Flex Time/Pitch, Quick Swipe Comping, Marquee tool
- **[[Ableton Live]]:** Warp modes, non-destructive clip editing, Session View arrangement
- **[[Reaper]]:** Fully customizable editing actions, scripting, razor edits

## Practical Application
- Use [[Izotope RX]] as an external sample editor for repair tasks beyond DAW capabilities
- Set up keyboard shortcuts for nudge values matching your grid resolution
- Learn Tab to Transient in [[Pro Tools]] for rapid navigation during editing
- Use equal-power crossfades for musical content, equal-gain for dialog
- Commit time-stretched audio to avoid real-time processing overhead

## Common Mistakes
- Over-relying on time stretching instead of getting better performances
- Using destructive editing without keeping original audio backed up
- Not crossfading every edit point, leading to clicks and pops
- Ignoring phase alignment when comping between takes
- Editing at the wrong zoom level and missing micro-timing issues
