# Automation and Mix Moves

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Automation — the art of dynamic changes throughout a mix — generated 726 categorized messages in #mixing-talk. The community emphasizes that automation is often what separates a good mix from a great one. Volume rides on vocals, fader automation for energy builds, and clip gain for pre-compression leveling are the most discussed techniques. Felix Byrne's pinned advice on clip gain and the community's discussion of "Kodawari" — the Japanese philosophy of perfecting craft through meticulous effort — frame automation as the detail work that defines professional mixing.

## Detail

### Volume Rides

Vocal volume rides are the most discussed automation technique:

- **Ride the vocal through the entire song** — ensuring every word is intelligible and the vocal sits consistently in the mix
- Volume rides compensate for what compression cannot: musical dynamics that need to change with the arrangement
- Professional mixers spend significant time on vocal rides — it's not glamorous but it's critical
- Automate in small moves (1-3 dB) rather than dramatic jumps

### Clip Gain

Clip gain (adjusting the level of audio regions/clips before they hit the channel strip) is Felix Byrne's strongly recommended first step:

Clip gain benefits:
- Evens out dramatic performance dynamics before compression, allowing compressors to work more evenly
- Faster than adding multiple compressors to handle dynamic range
- Preserves the natural character of the performance while solving level problems
- Works pre-insert, so all downstream processing sees a more consistent signal

### Fader Automation for Arrangement

Beyond vocal rides, fader automation shapes the energy and dynamics of the entire mix:

- **Verse-to-chorus lifts:** Subtle 0.5-1 dB boosts on the drum bus and instrument bus entering choruses
- **Build/drop automation:** Gradually increasing levels and effects leading into a drop or climax
- **Muting and un-muting:** Pulling elements in and out for arrangement interest
- **Effects throws:** Automating reverb and delay sends for specific moments (delay throws on last words of phrases)

### Plugin Automation

Automating plugin parameters adds movement and interest:

- **Filter sweeps:** Automating a low-pass or high-pass filter for build/release effects
- **Reverb send automation:** More reverb on sustained notes, less on rhythmic passages
- **Compression threshold:** Adjusting compression intensity between song sections
- **Saturation drive:** Increasing distortion for aggressive sections

### The Kodawari Philosophy

chrissorem introduced the Japanese concept of Kodawari to the mixing-talk community as a framework for understanding the meticulous detail work of automation:

### Pro Tools Metering Discovery

Iwan Morgan's discovery about Pro Tools metering settings affecting his mix approach highlights how monitoring and metering influence automation decisions:

> "All it took was changing my Pro Tools metering" (36 reactions) — followed by: "Feeling pretty good today, I spent yesterday morning pulling apart a mix for an artist who said last week they 'really loved' it." (34 reactions)

## Practical Application

- Use clip gain as the first step to even out dramatic level changes before any processing
- Ride the vocal through the entire song — every word should be intelligible
- Automate subtle fader moves (0.5-1 dB) between sections for energy management
- Set up delay/reverb throw automation on vocal sends for dramatic moments
- Listen through the mix multiple times focusing only on automation, not processing

## Common Mistakes

- Relying entirely on compression for dynamics control instead of manual volume rides
- Making automation moves too dramatic — subtlety is key
- Automating before the mix is otherwise finished — automation should be one of the last steps
- Not using clip gain before compression, forcing compressors to handle extreme dynamics
- Ignoring automation entirely and delivering a static, lifeless mix
