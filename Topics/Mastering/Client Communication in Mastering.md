# Client Communication in Mastering

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Client communication is one of the most discussed topics in #mastering-talk (1,166 messages), reflecting its central importance to professional mastering. The channel provides extensive guidance on handling reference tracks that contradict client notes, diplomatically communicating mix problems, managing revisions, dealing with rejected masters, and working with non-technical artists. The overarching philosophy is that mastering engineers sell confidence and emotional assurance as much as technical processing.

## Detail

### The Confidence Product

Several community members articulate that mastering engineers provide an intangible service beyond technical processing.

> "The confidence this gives people is part of what we are paid for, but again nothing I'm doing tonight can sell more gear, plug ins or tutorials so we never see it focused on."

> [!quote] Nomograph Mastering (2025-07-03) — 9 reactions
> "That stuff stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what it is we do. They think we sell processing, or our fancy speakers. But we sell the feeling that it's done, or could not be better."

### Working with Young and Non-Technical Artists

> "Very important for working with younger artists — don't ask them for notes, ask them how it feels. If you create a space for notes they will feel compelled to give them."

This principle — asking "how does it feel?" rather than "what changes do you want?" — is one of the channel's most impactful communication techniques. It prevents artists from generating technical feedback they aren't qualified to give, while still capturing their artistic intent.

### Handling Contradictory References

A common challenge: clients send reference tracks that contradict their written notes.

> "Lots of good points. But there is a 3rd way. 'Hey man, feels great. Can you send me a screenshot of your GP settings and a print without?'"

The community advises:

- Trust the reference track over the written notes when they conflict
- Ask clarifying questions rather than assuming
- When a reference contradicts the client's stated goals, gently point out the difference and ask which direction they prefer

### Diplomatically Communicating Mix Problems

Mastering engineers frequently receive mixes with issues (stereo image problems, excessive processing, tonal imbalances) but must communicate this without damaging the relationship.

> [!quote] Nomograph Mastering (2025-06-20) — 17 reactions
> "Your clients will be your greatest teachers. I learn more every year than the last, and I'm 31 years into record life and 23 in mastering. Clients understand music intuitively, they are reaching for something bigger than LUFS, and tonal balance curves. Keep an open ear, write short emails and you'll keep learning."

Key approaches discussed:

- **Frame issues as questions, not criticisms** — "Is this how the vocal is intended to sit?" rather than "The vocal is too loud"
- **Offer alternatives** — "I can work with this, but if you have a version without the limiter on the mix bus, I may be able to give you more options"
- **Focus on the outcome** — describe what you're hearing rather than what's "wrong"

### The Revision Trap

> [!quote] Berlin (2024-08-28) — 30 reactions
> "New one today from a 'returning' client — 'We ended up not using your master on the last track, we went another direction. That being said, we would like you to master our next single, but perhaps at a discounted rate since we ended up not approving the last track we did together?'"

Revision management is a major topic:

- **Set revision limits upfront** in your terms of service
- **Multiple versions are usually counterproductive** — kylem (25 reactions) described receiving 6 versions from a mastering engineer, creating decision paralysis for the artist, manager, and producer
- **Send one confident master** — if the client needs options, provide them on request rather than preemptively

### Master Rejection

The channel documents scenarios where masters were rejected and how to handle them professionally:

- Accept that rejection happens and is part of the business
- Don't take it personally — the artist's vision may simply not align with your approach
- Use rejection as a learning opportunity rather than a grievance
- Don't publicly criticize clients

> [!quote] Berlin (2025-10-28) — 18 reactions
> "Just a reminder to not criticize your client base publicly on your IG stories."

### Working from Limited References

One of the channel's most-reacted threads involved Edsel Holden mastering from a pre-limited mix reference rather than the unlimited mix:

> [!quote] Edsel Holden (2023-03-14) — 48 reactions
> "The mixer bullseye'd this song. It was totally ON POINT and my chain was getting nowhere close... A great word of advice came through — 'The only rule is what gives the best final outcome.'"

This challenged conventional mastering practice and sparked extensive discussion about when it's appropriate to work from a limited reference.

### Mentorship and Professional Growth

The channel has a strong mentorship culture, particularly around professional conduct.

> [!quote] cian riordan (2023-05-11) — 25 reactions (pinned)
> "Seeing him traverse the music industry, doing the best job possible, while being kind and fair to people, understanding artist intent and vision, and being absolutely honest about his own shortcomings — you couldn't pay enough money for that kind of masterclass."

## Practical Application

- Ask artists how the music **feels** rather than requesting technical notes
- Trust reference tracks over written descriptions when they conflict
- Send one confident master; offer alternatives only if requested
- Frame mix issues as questions, not criticisms
- Set revision limits and terms before starting work
- Never criticize clients publicly
- Build relationships based on trust and consistent quality
