# AD-DA Conversion

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion is one of the most debated topics in the community, with strong opinions on whether converter quality matters, how much to spend, and whether standalone converters justify their cost over built-in interface conversion. With 382 matches, this topic generates passionate discussion that spans the full spectrum from objectivist measurement-based perspectives to subjective listening-based arguments.

## Community Consensus

- **For AD (recording)**: Most modern converters sound functionally identical above the entry level
- **For DA (monitoring)**: Differences are more audible and may justify investment
- **The [[Topping]] DAC** ($350) is the community's consensus "best value" recommendation for monitoring conversion
- **Shop for converters based on features and I/O count**, not sound quality -- they are closer in sound than marketing suggests
- **Room and monitors matter more** -- You will not hear converter differences through budget monitors in an untreated room
- **This topic generates more heat than light** -- The community acknowledges it is a contentious area

## The Great Converter Debate

### "Converters All Sound the Same"

> [!quote] David Fuller
> "Realistically? Converters all sound the same. Distortion is below perception in all but the cheapest converters, frequency response is ruler flat from DC-Nyquist."

> [!quote] cian riordan
> "Like Fuller said, they sound the same. I'd shop based on features and compatibility. Having 32 in/out enables me to have all my outboard on dedicated inserts which makes integrating hardware in my mixes a real breeze."

The objectivist position: measurably, modern converters are extremely close in performance. Differences in THD+N, frequency response, and jitter are well below audibility thresholds. For AD (recording), this is especially true.

### "I Can Hear the Difference"

> [!quote] Rob Domos
> "The difference between say, RME and Dangerous converters isn't even subtle to me. The Dangerous I used has audibly more distortion than the RME... but it pops out of the speakers more. None of the top finishers are falling for audiophile power cables, but pretty much all of them without exception are spending racks on DACs."

> [!quote] Zack Hames
> "I notice dramatic differences in DACs for monitoring. But as far as analog inputs/outputs in interface/converters I've never heard any difference."

The subjectivist position: DA conversion for monitoring is audibly different between units, especially through high-resolution monitoring in treated rooms. THD+N measurements correlate with subjective impressions.

### The Pragmatic Middle Ground

> [!quote] cian riordan
> "I think if you're a top finisher and making 7 figures a year, you should definitely blow your load on analog converters -- even though that's 100% not the reason for your success. If you're living in the mortal realm, I think it's OK to accept that it's a small part of the puzzle and move on."

> [!quote] Zakhiggins
> "Surely above a certain level the difference is negligible? This is kinda putting the cart before the horse in terms of sonic quality."

## Converter Recommendations by Category

### Budget Interfaces with Good Conversion

| Interface | Price Range | Community Notes |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| [[Focusrite Scarlett]] series | $150-500 | Perfectly adequate conversion |
| [[Audient iD]] series | $200-500 | Clean conversion, good value |
| [[Universal Audio Apollo]] | $600-2,500 | Community-standard "step up" from budget interfaces |

### Standalone Converters

| Converter | Price Range | Channel Count | Community Notes |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| [[Antelope Orion 32]] | ~$3,000 | 32 in/out | cian riordan switched from Lynx Aurora to Orion for PT Native HD compatibility: "works flawlessly" |
| [[Lynx Aurora]] | $2,000-4,000 | 8-32 channels | Classic choice, though older blue-face models had Pro Tools compatibility issues |
| [[RME]] converters | $1,000-3,000 | Various | Excellent measured performance, very low THD+N |
| [[Dangerous Music]] converters | $1,500-3,000 | 2-16 channels | Slightly higher distortion that some members prefer as "character" |
| [[Prism Sound]] | $3,000-8,000 | 2-8 channels | Ultra-high-end, mastering standard |

### Monitoring DACs

| DAC | Price Range | Community Notes |
|-----|------------|-----------------|
| [[Topping]] DAC (various models) | ~$350 | "15 times less THD+N than the Dangerous... Perfect for mere mortals" -- Rob Domos. Community consensus best-value DAC |
| [[Grace Design m906]] onboard DAC | Included with controller | High-quality DAC built into monitor controller |
| Interface DAC outputs | $0 (already own) | Functional for most applications |

## AD vs DA -- Different Priorities

### AD Conversion (Recording)
- Differences between modern converters during recording are minimal
- Focus on **channel count, reliability, and DAW compatibility**
- The Antelope Orion 32's value is in its 32 channels of clean I/O, not a "sound"
- "I'd shop based on features and compatibility" -- cian riordan

### DA Conversion (Monitoring)
- This is where differences may be more audible
- The monitoring DAC feeds your ears all day -- accuracy matters
- The Topping DAC provides reference-grade DA for $350
- Higher-resolution monitoring chains reveal DAC differences more clearly

> [!quote] Eric Martin
> "The higher the resolution your monitors are, the easier it is to notice this in the converters."

## The Topping DAC Story

The [[Topping]] series of DACs (particularly models in the $200-500 range) have become a community phenomenon:
- Originally from the hi-fi world, adopted by pro audio engineers
- Measurably superior THD+N to many pro audio units costing 10x more
- "A third of this discord" uses Topping DACs according to Rob Domos
- Demonstrates that converter performance does not correlate linearly with price
- Available as a 2-channel monitoring DAC -- not a replacement for multi-channel interfaces

## Interface vs Standalone Conversion

### When Interface Conversion Is Fine
- Recording and mixing at home/project studio level
- Budget under $3,000 for your total interface/conversion setup
- You do not need more I/O than your interface provides
- You have not maxed out improvements in room treatment, monitors, and microphones

### When Standalone Converters Make Sense
- You need high channel counts (16-32+) for tracking live bands or integrating lots of outboard
- You want to separate your DAW connection (Thunderbolt/USB) from your conversion (MADI/AES)
- You are a mastering engineer requiring the highest monitoring accuracy
- Your monitoring chain is already at a level where conversion differences become audible

## Common Debates

### Antelope: Love It or Hate It
- David Fuller: "I wouldn't get any Antelope stuff if I was paid to use it"
- cian riordan: Uses the Antelope Orion 32 and it "works flawlessly"
- Mixed reputation for software/driver stability but praised for conversion quality and I/O density

### Do All-in-One Solutions Compromise?
- Some members believe separating conversion from preamps from monitoring yields better results
- Others argue that modern all-in-one interfaces (Apollo, Antelope) have eliminated meaningful compromises
- "At this price point, do they still come with compromises?" -- The answer appears to be "not really"

### Objective Testing vs Subjective Listening
> [!quote] peterlabberton
> "Confirmation bias is powerful. It would be really hard for me to reliably say I hear a difference in D/A conversion going to my monitors without being able to A/B in real time."

The community acknowledges that proper comparison requires level-matched, blind, instantaneous ABX testing -- which most people have never done rigorously.

## Tips from the Community

- If you are going to invest in conversion, prioritize your **monitoring DAC** over your AD converters
- The Topping DAC at $350 is a "no brainer" for 2-channel monitoring DA
- Do not upgrade converters until your room, monitors, and speaker positioning are dialed in
- For high channel counts, shop based on I/O density and DAW compatibility
- Clock quality matters less than conversion quality in modern units -- most have excellent onboard clocks
- The difference between a $500 interface and a $5,000 converter is far smaller than the difference between an untreated room and a treated one

## Common Mistakes

- **Upgrading converters before treating your room** -- You cannot hear converter differences in a bad room
- **Obsessing over AD conversion quality** when DA quality matters more for your daily work
- **Spending thousands on converters while mixing on budget monitors**
- **Assuming expensive = audibly better** -- The Topping DAC outmeasures many units costing 10x more
- **Ignoring compatibility and reliability** in favor of specifications -- The best-sounding converter that crashes your DAW is useless
- **Conflating DAC quality with interface quality** -- They are related but not the same thing
