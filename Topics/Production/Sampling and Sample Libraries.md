# Sampling and Sample Libraries

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Sampling and sample libraries are discussed in #production-talk with 603 categorized messages. The channel covers sample library recommendations, sample pack workflow, creative sampling techniques (chopping, flipping, layering), the role of samples in modern production, and the philosophical tension between using samples and tracking live instruments. Notable community resources include Skyler Young's shared sample packs (29 reactions) and oaklandmatt's recommendations for Oliver Power Tools and KSHMR packs.

## Detail

### Sample Pack Workflow

> "Oliver power tools and kshmr are the most useful and most modern packs. Not sure what kind of music you're making but for my workflow I like doing whatever I feel on a production and then having quick access to one-shots and loops that can fill in the gaps."

Key workflow principles:
- **Use samples to fill gaps** — start with your creative vision, then use samples to supplement where live tracking isn't practical
- **Organize by type and character** — one-shots, loops, textures; bright, dark, aggressive, subtle
- **Audition in context** — a sample that sounds great solo may not sit in the mix

### Creative Sampling Techniques

- **Mono-ing for arrangement contrast** — spectrummasters (12 reactions): accidentally mono-ing a sample in the verse but not the chorus created an effective width contrast
- **Click track replacement** — BatMeckley (13 reactions): using a drum loop instead of a click to help singers with timing
- **Happy accidents** — several members share stories of errors leading to creative discoveries

### Sample Libraries and Services

**Subscription services:**
- **Splice** — the dominant sample subscription platform; widely used for one-shots, loops, and presets

**Major sample library developers (for Kontakt and other samplers):**
- **Spitfire Audio** — orchestral and cinematic libraries
- **8Dio** — deep-sampled orchestral instruments
- **EastWest** — Hollywood Orchestra and other professional libraries
- **Native Instruments** — Kontakt platform and first-party libraries

### Live vs Sampled

The debate is not binary — community consensus favors hybrid approaches:

> "Quick shoutout to @Zack Hames for remote recording & delivering pro level drums. He saved me on that cranberries loop thing I was looking for and then absolutely smashed a full song performance for a country song. Pro delivery, great communication, enthusiastic collaborator, reasonable rate, tight and tasteful performances."

Remote session musicians (like Zack Hames for drums) bridge the gap between programmed samples and in-person live recording, providing real performances without the overhead of booking a studio session.

### Community Shared Resources

Skyler Young contributed free sample packs to the community (29 reactions on the Dropbox link), and actively develops production tools — including building a custom 808/synth bass plugin because "there's a lot of room for improvement over 808 Cooker and SubLab."

## Practical Application

- Build a personal library of go-to samples organized by type and character
- Use samples to supplement, not replace, creative decisions — start with your vision first
- Audition samples in the context of the mix, not in isolation
- Consider remote session musicians as a middle ground between samples and full studio sessions
- Experiment with creative processing on samples (mono-ing, pitching, reversing) for unique textures

## Common Mistakes

- Using samples as a substitute for learning to program or perform parts
- Not processing samples to fit the mix — raw samples rarely sit perfectly without EQ and level adjustment
- Over-relying on loops without making them your own through chopping, layering, or reprocessing
- Ignoring licensing terms on sample packs when releasing commercial music
- Using too many samples from the same pack, creating a generic sound
