# Beat Making and Drum Programming

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Beat making and drum programming is a major topic in #production-talk with 593 categorized messages. The channel's perspective differs from [[Drum Mixing]] (which focuses on mixing recorded drums) — production-talk covers **creating drum parts**, whether programmed, sampled, or performed. Key themes include the live-vs-programmed debate, groove and swing philosophy, sample augmentation, percussion as "the sauce," and the philosophical question of when technical perfection serves (or undermines) the music.

## Detail

### Live vs Programmed Drums

One of the channel's most debated topics:

> "I can just imagine this scenario. A producer sequences all the drum parts, they do the demos, write the song and whatever. Then they book a session and Matt Chamberlain shows up with a pristine Drum-Doctor tuned kit and an invoice for cartage."

The community consensus is pragmatic: use whatever serves the song.

- **Programmed drums** work well for electronic genres, precise pop production, and demos
- **Live drums** bring feel, dynamics, and humanity that are difficult to replicate
- **Hybrid approach** — many members program drum parts as demos, then have a session drummer interpret them, sometimes keeping the programmed parts as augmentation

### Groove, Swing, and Quantization

The community discusses groove as a production fundamental:

- **Quantization debate** — strict quantization works for some genres (EDM, trap) but kills the feel of others
- **Swing** — adding swing to quantized patterns humanizes them; the specific swing percentage is genre-dependent
- **Groove templates** — extracting groove from a reference performance and applying it to programmed parts
- oaklandmatt expressed wanting to "spend hours (maybe my whole life?) talking about groove"

### The "One-Take" vs "Assembled" Debate

> "Dr Luke might be the best guitarist I've ever been around (and I've hung with Blake Mills, Tim Pierce, Phil X), and he CONSTANTLY would just hit record, play the four chords of the song free time, and then cut them up and drop them on the ones. My favorite thing about making records vs performing them live is that on record NO ONE CARES how you got there, just that you did."

### Percussion and Layering

### Sample Augmentation

### Arrangement Through Subtraction

> **Author:** Rollmottle — **Date:** 2024-11-26 — **Channel:** #production-talk — 11 reactions
> "Adding stuff is always effective but I like trying to pare back the arrangement to see if I can get away with something. Dropping the kick, the bass or snare for a bar, 1/2 a bar, or one beat can sometimes give you the push and pull you were looking for."

### Creative Techniques

- **Click track alternatives** — BatMeckley (13 reactions): "Putting down a drum loop solved a singer's timing issue today"
- **Varispeed for low end** — cian riordan (15 reactions): "Often when I'm recording drums I'll track the drummer at a higher BPM then varispeed everything down to tempo... great way to get deep low end"
- **Happy accidents** — spectrummasters (12 reactions): accidentally mono-ing a sample in the verse but not the chorus created an effective arrangement contrast

## Practical Application

- Start with the groove — if the drums don't feel right, nothing else will sit properly
- Use a click track alternative (drum loop, percussion pattern) when a strict click kills the feel
- Layer percussion on top of programmed drums to add life and movement
- Try subtraction before addition — dropping elements creates contrast and forward motion
- Don't quantize everything — some genres need the human imperfection

## Common Mistakes

- Over-quantizing and removing the groove from drum parts
- Using too many drum sounds instead of making a few sounds work well together
- Neglecting percussion as an arrangement tool
- Prioritizing technical drum performance over what serves the song
- Not considering the varispeed technique for achieving deeper low end
