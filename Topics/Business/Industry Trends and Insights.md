## Detail

### AI in Music Production

A major discussion topic, especially from 2023 onward:
- **AI mixing/mastering tools** — community is skeptical of fully automated solutions but acknowledges incremental utility
- **AI-generated music** — ethical concerns about artist replacement and creative authenticity
- **AI as tool vs replacement** — the consensus favors AI as assistant (e.g., better Melodyne, faster QC) rather than autonomous creator

- **Loudness normalization** varies significantly between platforms and devices
- **Distribution** — DistroKid, TuneCore, CD Baby compared for indie artists
- **Playlist economics** — algorithmic vs editorial playlists, the impact on artist discovery
- **Streaming fraud** — flagging issues, fake streams, pool model exploitation

### Grammy and Awards Culture

> One of the great signs of success in our line of work is when your records win awards, the artist goes on stage and thanks you profusely. Seeing Annie thank cian riordan over and over today is so cool and beautiful.
