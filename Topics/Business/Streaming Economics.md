# Streaming Economics

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> The #biz-talk community provides a sobering analysis of the streaming economy. Key data points — 13,000 artists earning $50k/year from Spotify out of 7M+ artists, 250 artists capturing 90% of streams, and the pool payment model that benefits major labels — paint a picture of extreme consolidation that most independent artists and producers cannot rely on for income.

## Detail

### Spotify's Pool Payment Model

Spotify does not pay a fixed per-stream rate. Instead:
- All subscription revenue goes into a pool
- Each artist's share is determined by their percentage of total streams on the platform
- This means a listener's subscription fee goes to the most-streamed artists, not necessarily the artists they personally listen to
- The effective "per-stream rate" fluctuates based on total platform activity and varies by country
- This model inherently favors artists with massive stream counts over niche artists with dedicated fanbases

### The Consolidation Problem

Community-cited statistics on streaming concentration:
- **13,000 artists earn $50,000/year from Spotify** — out of 7+ million artists on the platform
- **~250 artists capture approximately 90% of all streams**
- The top 1% of artists earn the vast majority of streaming revenue
- This concentration has worsened over time as platform growth hasn't kept pace with artist growth

### Major Label Conflicts of Interest

The community identifies structural conflicts in the streaming ecosystem:
- **Major labels own equity stakes in Spotify** — they benefit from Spotify's growth regardless of artist payouts
- Labels negotiate bulk deals for their entire catalog, receiving guaranteed minimums
- Independent artists compete for the remaining pool after label guarantees are met
- Label-owned playlist curation creates a feedback loop favoring major label artists
- The major labels' dual role as both content suppliers and platform stakeholders creates inherent conflicts

### Playlist Economics and Major Label Favoritism

Playlist placement is the primary driver of streaming volume:
- Editorial playlists controlled by platform employees heavily favor major label releases
- Algorithmic playlists are influenced by initial momentum, which playlist placement provides
- Independent artists face a chicken-and-egg problem: need playlist placement for streams, need streams for playlist placement
- Some community members report success with organic playlist strategies, but the consensus is that the system favors established acts

### Fraudulent Stream Flagging

A particularly frustrating issue for independent artists:
- Streaming platforms flag and remove streams they suspect are artificial/fraudulent
- Artists have reported legitimate streams being flagged with zero recourse or appeal process
- The algorithms for detecting fraud are opaque and can penalize genuine viral moments
- Revenue from flagged streams is withheld or clawed back
- This creates existential risk for independent artists relying on streaming revenue

### Distributor Issues

Community experiences with distribution services:
- **TuneCore disputes** — multiple members report difficulties with TuneCore's accounting and customer service
- **DistroKid** — generally positive sentiment for simple distribution needs; split functionality appreciated
- **CD Baby** — mentioned as a reliable alternative
- Distribution choice matters less than understanding that distribution alone doesn't generate income

## Practical Application

- Do not build a business plan around streaming revenue as a primary income source
- Use streaming primarily as a discovery and credibility tool, not a revenue generator
- Focus on revenue streams you can control: live performance, sync licensing, direct sales, services
- If you do pursue streaming, understand the pool model and set realistic expectations
- Consider alternative platforms and direct-to-fan models (Bandcamp, Patreon) for engaged audiences

## Common Mistakes

- **Expecting streaming to replace traditional income** — the math doesn't work for 99.9% of artists
- **Paying for playlist placement services** — most are scams that risk getting your music flagged
- **Ignoring the pool model** — thinking in "per-stream rates" misrepresents how payment works
- **Not diversifying revenue streams** — streaming should be one small piece of a larger strategy
- **Blaming the distributor** for low streaming income — the platform economics are the fundamental issue
