# Business Structure for Music Professionals

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> Rollmottle emerges as the channel's definitive expert on business structure, providing detailed frameworks for LLC vs S-Corp decisions, self-employment tax strategies, and accounting tool recommendations. The community consensus: an LLC is almost always the right first step, with S-Corp election becoming beneficial only after reaching a certain income threshold.

## Detail

### LLC vs S-Corp Decision Framework

The most detailed business structure discussion in #biz-talk, primarily driven by Rollmottle:

**LLC (Limited Liability Company):**
- Recommended starting point for virtually all freelance music professionals
- Separates personal and business liability
- Simple formation and maintenance (varies by state)
- Pass-through taxation — business income reported on personal return
- No requirement for payroll, board meetings, or complex compliance
- State formation fees range from ~$50 to $800/year depending on state

**S-Corp (S-Corporation election):**
- Not a separate entity — an LLC elects S-Corp tax status with the IRS
- Primary benefit: reduces self-employment tax on income above a "reasonable salary"
- Requires paying yourself a W-2 salary and running payroll
- Additional compliance: payroll taxes, quarterly filings, potentially annual reports
- Estimated additional annual cost: ~$2,500/year for payroll service and additional accounting

**When S-Corp makes sense:**
- Generally when net business income exceeds ~$60,000–80,000/year (varies by situation)
- The self-employment tax savings must exceed the additional compliance costs
- Consult with a CPA familiar with music industry/freelance income before electing

### Self-Employment Tax Burden

Key tax realities for freelance music professionals:
- Self-employment tax is 15.3% on net earnings (Social Security 12.4% + Medicare 2.9%)
- This is in addition to income tax
- S-Corp election allows splitting income into salary (subject to SE tax) and distributions (not subject to SE tax)
- Quarterly estimated tax payments are required to avoid penalties
- Deductible expenses (gear, software, studio space, travel) reduce taxable income

### Business Banking and Accounting Tools

Community-recommended tools:
- **Wave Accounting** — free accounting software, popular for simplicity; handles invoicing and expense tracking
- **QuickBooks** — more robust, preferred as income grows; better integration with CPAs
- **Separate business bank account** — essential for liability protection and clean bookkeeping
- **Business credit card** — simplifies expense tracking and builds business credit

### PPP Loan Requirements (Historical)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, business structure affected PPP loan eligibility:
- Having an established LLC or S-Corp with clean financial records was required
- Sole proprietors could apply but with additional documentation hurdles
- Community members who had proper business structures in place were able to access relief funds more quickly
- This served as a real-world lesson in the value of maintaining formal business structure

### State-Specific Fee Variations

Annual business entity maintenance costs vary dramatically by state:
- **Lowest:** States like Wyoming, New Mexico (~$50/year)
- **Moderate:** Most states ($100–300/year)
- **Highest:** California ($800/year franchise tax minimum, regardless of income)
- Some community members formed LLCs in low-fee states for cost savings, though this introduces nexus and compliance complexity

## Practical Application

- Form an LLC as soon as you're earning regular freelance income from music
- Open a dedicated business bank account immediately
- Track all business expenses from day one — even before forming an entity
- Use Wave (free) or QuickBooks for bookkeeping; graduate to a CPA as income grows
- Evaluate S-Corp election annually once net income exceeds $60k
- Set aside 25–30% of income for quarterly estimated taxes

## Common Mistakes

- **Operating as sole proprietor for too long** — no liability protection, mixed finances
- **Electing S-Corp too early** — the compliance costs exceed tax savings at lower income levels
- **Not making quarterly estimated tax payments** — leads to penalties and a painful April surprise
- **Commingling personal and business funds** — undermines liability protection
- **Forming an LLC in a "cheap" state without understanding nexus rules** — may create multi-state filing requirements
- **Not keeping receipts** — deductions without documentation are useless in an audit
