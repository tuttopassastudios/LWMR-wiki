# Music Business Pricing and Rates

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> Pricing is the single most discussed topic in #biz-talk. The community extensively debates standard rates for mixing and production, the merits of hourly vs project-based pricing, geographic rate variations, and strategies for raising rates over time. The recurring theme: lower-budget clients tend to be far more demanding than high-budget ones.

## Detail

### Standard Mixing and Production Rates

Community-reported rate ranges for mixing vary enormously depending on experience, market, and clientele:
- **Entry-level / building portfolio:** $0–200 per song (often strategic relationship-building)
- **Working professional:** $500–1,500 per song
- **Established / major label:** $2,500–10,000+ per song
- **Top-tier / A-list:** $10,000–50,000+ per song (typically includes backend points)

Production rates follow similar tiers but with more variability due to the creative scope involved.

### Hourly vs Project-Based Pricing

The community is broadly divided but trending toward project-based pricing for mixing:

**Project-based advantages:**
- Client knows total cost upfront — reduces friction
- Rewards efficiency — faster mixer earns higher effective hourly rate
- Prevents "running the clock" perception
- Easier to quote and negotiate

**Hourly advantages:**
- Protects against scope creep
- Fair for open-ended sessions (recording, production)
- Transparent billing

**Community consensus:** Project-based for mixing, hourly for recording/tracking sessions where scope is less predictable.

### Geographic Rate Variations

Rates vary significantly by market:
- **LA / Nashville / NYC:** Highest rates, but also highest competition and cost of living
- **Secondary markets:** Lower rates but often less competition; can build loyal client base faster
- **International markets:** mixedbywong_my provides perspective on how rates differ dramatically outside the US — some markets support strong rates due to less competition, others are extremely price-sensitive

### When and How to Raise Rates

Community strategies for rate increases:
- Raise rates for new clients first, grandfather existing relationships temporarily
- Use demand as the trigger — when you're turning away work, rates are too low
- Small incremental increases (10–20%) are easier for clients to absorb than large jumps
- Communicate value, not just cost — "I've invested in X, my workflow now delivers Y"
- Some members advocate doubling rates and accepting you'll lose some clients

### Sliding Scale Models

Several community members use sliding scale approaches:
- Lower rates for independent/unsigned artists, standard rates for label projects
- "Passion project" rates for music you genuinely believe in
- Free or reduced work in exchange for creative freedom and portfolio building
- The key: be intentional about when and why you discount, not reactive

## Practical Application

- Set project-based rates for mixing; use hourly for open-ended recording sessions
- Know your market's rate range before quoting — ask peers, not just the internet
- Raise rates when demand consistently exceeds capacity
- Never apologize for your rates — present them confidently and let the work speak
- Build in revision limits to project quotes to protect against scope creep

## Common Mistakes

- **Undercharging out of insecurity** — then resenting the work and delivering lower quality
- **Not having a rate card** — improvising prices leads to inconsistency and lost revenue
- **Comparing to top-tier rates too early** — focus on your market and experience level
- **Discounting without strategy** — random discounts devalue your services without building relationships
- **Charging hourly for mixing** — incentivizes slowness and creates billing anxiety for clients
