# Royalties and Backend Revenue

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> The community's consensus on backend revenue is stark: always get your money up front. While producer royalty points (typically 3–4%, up to 5–10%) are standard in major label deals, the harsh reality is that only a tiny fraction of projects ever generate meaningful royalty income. oaklandmatt's pinned advice on this topic is one of the channel's defining contributions.

## Detail

### Standard Producer and Mixer Royalty Rates

Industry-standard royalty allocations discussed in the community:
- **Producer points:** 3–4 points typical, up to 5–10 for top-tier producers
- **Mixer points:** Less common, typically 1–2 points when offered
- **Engineer points:** Rare, usually only on high-profile projects or when negotiated as part of a reduced upfront rate
- **Points are a percentage of the artist's royalty**, not of gross revenue — an important distinction

### The Harsh Reality of Backend Revenue

> "ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY UP FRONT. Backend is a bonus, never a business plan."

Community data points on royalty reality:
- Only about 30 out of hundreds (sometimes thousands) of projects actually generate royalty payments for a working producer/mixer
- Most royalty checks, when they do arrive, are negligibly small
- Recoupment clauses mean the label recoups costs before the artist (and therefore the producer) sees any royalties
- Major label accounting is notoriously opaque — tracking and verifying royalty payments is difficult

### Streaming Revenue Reality

The streaming economy has further compressed backend value:
- **13,000 artists earn $50k/year from Spotify** out of 7+ million artists on the platform
- ~250 artists capture approximately 90% of all streams
- Per-stream rates are not fixed — Spotify uses a pool model (see [[Streaming Economics]])
- For most indie releases, streaming royalties amount to pennies

### DistroKid and Indie Production Deals

For independent production work, DistroKid's splits system is frequently discussed:
- Allows producers and collaborators to receive automatic percentage splits on streaming revenue
- Simple setup — no label infrastructure needed
- Useful for indie production deals where traditional royalty structures don't apply
- Limitation: only covers the distribution platform, not publishing or sync

### When Backend Makes Sense

Despite the pessimistic data, the community identifies scenarios where royalties are worth pursuing:
- **Major label projects** with realistic commercial potential
- **Early-stage artists you genuinely believe in** — as a calculated bet, not a substitute for payment
- **When combined with a full upfront rate** — backend as bonus, never as compensation
- **Co-production deals** where you're a creative partner, not a hired hand

## Practical Application

- Always negotiate full upfront payment; treat royalties as potential bonus income
- Get royalty agreements in writing before starting work (see [[Contracts and Legal for Music Professionals]])
- Use DistroKid splits for indie collaborations where traditional royalty tracking isn't feasible
- Track all royalty-eligible projects in a spreadsheet — you'll need records for tax purposes
- Register with a [[PRO]] to collect performance royalties on any compositions you co-write

## Common Mistakes

- **Accepting reduced upfront rates in exchange for "generous" backend points** — the math almost never works out
- **Not getting royalty agreements in writing** — verbal promises are worth nothing when money is involved
- **Failing to register works with your PRO** — uncollected performance royalties are lost forever
- **Confusing master royalties with publishing royalties** — they are separate income streams with different collection mechanisms
- **Assuming streaming will eventually pay off** — the economics favor extreme consolidation at the top
