# Contracts and Legal for Music Professionals

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> The #biz-talk community consistently emphasizes one principle above all others: get everything in writing. From split sheets to producer agreements, the channel provides practical guidance on protecting yourself legally as a music professional — without necessarily needing a lawyer for every transaction.

## Detail

### Split Sheets

[[Split Sheet|Split sheets]] are the most frequently recommended legal document in the channel:
- Should be completed **before** or **immediately after** every co-writing or co-production session
- Define ownership percentages for each contributor
- Cover both master recording and composition rights (or specify which)
- Even a simple email confirming splits can serve as documentation
- Templates are widely available online and through PROs

### Producer Agreements

Key elements the community identifies for producer agreements:
- **Upfront payment terms** — amount, payment schedule, kill fee if project is abandoned
- **Master vs publishing rights** — specify exactly what rights are being assigned or retained
- **Royalty points** — percentage, calculation basis, audit rights (see [[Royalties and Backend Revenue]])
- **Credit requirements** — how the producer will be credited on releases
- **Revision scope** — how many revisions are included in the agreed fee
- **Delivery specifications** — file formats, stem requirements, delivery timeline

### Label Deal Implications

Community wisdom on label deals and their impact on producers/engineers:
- Label deals often include clauses that affect how producers are paid
- "360 deals" may claim a percentage of revenue streams beyond recordings
- Recoupment clauses determine when royalties start flowing
- Some labels require producers to sign work-for-hire agreements — know what you're giving up
- Getting independent legal review before signing anything with a label is strongly recommended

### Getting Everything in Writing

The community's practical approach:
- Full contracts are ideal but not always practical for every project
- At minimum: an email exchange confirming scope, payment, timeline, and rights
- Text messages and DMs can serve as evidence but are less reliable
- For repeat clients, establish a template agreement and reuse it
- For larger projects or label work, invest in proper legal review

### Never Accept Publishing Buyouts

Strong community consensus against selling publishing rights:
- Publishing generates income over the life of the composition — potentially decades
- Buyout offers are almost always undervalued relative to long-term earning potential
- If you co-wrote the song, you have a right to your publishing share
- The only scenario where a buyout might make sense: if you're in financial distress and need immediate cash (and even then, proceed with caution)

## Practical Application

- Complete a [[Split Sheet]] for every collaborative session, no exceptions
- Create a simple producer agreement template for your standard terms
- Get independent legal review for any label deal or contract you don't fully understand
- Keep copies of all agreements, emails, and correspondence related to each project
- Register all co-written works with your [[PRO]] promptly

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming verbal agreements will be honored** — they frequently aren't when money is involved
- **Signing work-for-hire without understanding the implications** — you may be giving up all rights
- **Not specifying revision limits in agreements** — leads to unlimited revisions and resentment
- **Accepting publishing buyouts** — almost always a bad deal long-term
- **Waiting until there's a dispute to document terms** — by then it's too late
- **Not reading contracts before signing** — particularly label agreements with complex recoupment clauses
