# Music Publishing and Songwriting Splits

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> Publishing rights and songwriting splits represent one of the most valuable and misunderstood aspects of the music business. The #biz-talk community provides practical guidance on co-writing split conventions, protecting publishing rights, and understanding the different royalty collection mechanisms — with a strong consensus that you should never sell your publishing.

## Detail

### Co-Writing Split Conventions

Community guidance on dividing songwriting credit:
- **Equal contribution = equal split** — if two people co-write, default to 50/50
- **"Everyone in the room" approach** — increasingly common in pop/hip-hop: all contributors split equally regardless of individual contribution
- Some sessions use contribution-based splits (lyrics vs melody vs production)
- The community recommends discussing splits before or during the session, not after
- Disputes about contribution are the #1 source of songwriting conflicts

### Split Negotiation Strategies

Practical approaches from the community:
- Have the split conversation early — ideally before the first note is written
- Use a [[Split Sheet]] to document everything immediately
- Be generous rather than territorial — a generous reputation leads to more co-writing opportunities
- If you start a song and someone else finishes it, the split should reflect both contributions
- Producer contribution to a composition (melodic/harmonic ideas, arrangement) can justify a publishing split

### Conflict Resolution

When co-writers disagree on splits:
- Start from equal splits and adjust only with clear justification
- If one person started the song and another finished it, acknowledge both contributions proportionally
- Having a neutral third party (manager, publisher) mediate can help
- The earlier you establish split expectations, the less room for conflict
- Never let a disagreement about splits prevent you from releasing music — the opportunity cost is real

### Protecting Publishing Rights

Strong community consensus on publishing protection:
- **Never accept a publishing buyout** — publishing generates income over the life of the composition
- Understand the difference between master recording rights and publishing/composition rights
- Signing a publishing deal doesn't mean selling your publishing — it means sharing administration
- Some labels ask for publishing as part of a recording deal — this is a separate negotiation
- Co-publishing deals (50/50 with a publisher) are more standard than full publishing assignments

### Mechanical Royalties and Collection

Understanding the [[Mechanical Royalties|mechanical royalty]] system:
- Mechanical royalties are paid for the reproduction of a composition (physical copies, downloads, streaming)
- In the US, the statutory mechanical rate is set by the Copyright Royalty Board
- Streaming mechanicals are paid through a complex formula involving the platform's total revenue
- Collection requires registration: with your [[PRO]] for performance royalties, and with a mechanical rights organization (Harry Fox Agency, Songtrust, etc.) for mechanical royalties
- Many songwriters leave mechanical royalties uncollected simply because they don't register

### PRO Registration for Compositions

Registering works with a [[PRO|Performing Rights Organization]]:
- Register every composition you write or co-write — performance royalties only flow to registered works
- Major PROs: ASCAP, BMI, SESAC (US); PRS (UK); SOCAN (Canada)
- Registration is separate from copyright registration (both are recommended)
- If you co-write, both writers should register the work with their respective PROs
- Registration should happen promptly after the song is written — don't wait for release

## Practical Application

- Discuss and document splits at the session, not weeks later
- Use [[Split Sheet|split sheets]] for every co-writing session
- Register all compositions with your [[PRO]] within days of completion
- Look into mechanical royalty collection (Songtrust, Harry Fox Agency) in addition to your PRO
- Never sign away publishing without independent legal review

## Common Mistakes

- **Not discussing splits until a song becomes successful** — by then, memories differ and tensions are high
- **Accepting publishing buyouts** — you're selling decades of potential income for a one-time payment
- **Forgetting to register works with your PRO** — unregistered compositions earn zero performance royalties
- **Ignoring mechanical royalties** — a significant income stream that many songwriters leave on the table
- **Confusing master royalties with publishing royalties** — they are entirely separate systems
- **Not understanding what a publishing deal actually means** — administration vs ownership vs co-publishing
