# Client Relations and Project Management

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> The #biz-talk community consistently observes that client behavior varies inversely with budget — lower-paying clients tend to be far more demanding. This page covers managing client relationships, setting revision expectations, remote collaboration tools, and the professional communication strategies that keep projects running smoothly.

## Detail

### High-Budget vs Low-Budget Client Behavior

One of the channel's most cited observations:

> "The $100 client has 84 mix notes, the $100k client says 'rad!'"

Community patterns:
- Higher-budget clients tend to trust the professional they hired and provide minimal, focused feedback
- Lower-budget clients often micromanage, provide excessive revision notes, and question creative decisions
- This is attributed to: inexperience (not knowing what to listen for), insecurity about spending money, and lack of context for professional workflow
- The lesson: higher rates often lead to easier, more enjoyable working relationships

### Revision Limits and Expectations

Community best practices for managing revisions:
- **Define revision limits in advance** — "includes 2 rounds of revisions" is standard
- Additional revisions beyond the included rounds should be billed at a clear hourly or per-round rate
- Provide a revision window — "revisions requested within 7 days of delivery" prevents indefinite projects
- First revision round usually addresses the most substantive notes; subsequent rounds should be increasingly minor
- If a client consistently wants many revisions, the issue is usually communication at the project outset, not the mix

### Communication Tools

The community uses and recommends:
- **AudioMovers** — real-time audio streaming for remote mix sessions; allows clients to hear the mix in real-time through a browser
- **Discord** — many client relationships start on this server
- **Zoom / FaceTime** — for face-to-face discussion during remote sessions
- **Email** — for formal communication, file delivery, and creating a paper trail
- **Text/DMs** — for quick check-ins, but not ideal for project-critical communication

### File Transfer Methods

Community-preferred file sharing solutions:
- **Google Drive** — widely used, good for ongoing collaboration with shared folders
- **Dropbox** — reliable, preferred by some for professional appearance
- **WeTransfer** — simple one-time transfers, no account required for recipient
- **Filepass** — purpose-built for audio delivery with streaming preview
- **MASV** — high-speed large file transfer, favored for stem delivery

### Remote Collaboration Workflows

The growth of remote collaboration is a major #biz-talk theme:
- AudioMovers or similar real-time streaming eliminates the need for in-person attendance
- Clear communication about monitoring environment is important — notes from laptop speakers may not be relevant
- Time zone management becomes critical for international clients
- Having a standard delivery format and naming convention prevents confusion
- Remote collaboration has expanded market access — you're no longer limited to local clients

### When to Work for Free or Cheap

The community's nuanced take on discounted work:
- **Strategic free work** can build relationships that lead to paid work later
- The key: be intentional about why you're discounting and what you expect to gain
- Build a portfolio, develop a relationship with a promising artist, gain experience in a new genre
- Set clear boundaries even on free projects — scope, timeline, and expectations still matter
- Avoid open-ended free work — "I'll do this one for free, my regular rate is $X" positions you correctly
- oaklandmatt cautions against chronic undervaluing disguised as "investment"

## Practical Application

- Include revision limits and communication expectations in every project agreement
- Use AudioMovers or similar tools for remote mix sessions to reduce miscommunication
- Standardize your file delivery format and naming conventions
- Create a project brief template that captures the client's goals before you start working
- Set clear timelines and check-in points for every project

## Common Mistakes

- **Not setting revision limits** — leads to endless rounds and growing resentment
- **Communicating only via text/DMs** — no paper trail for disputes; important decisions get lost
- **Accepting vague briefs** — "make it sound good" leads to mismatched expectations
- **Working for free without clear boundaries** — becomes an expectation rather than a gift
- **Not confirming technical specs upfront** — file format, sample rate, stem requirements should be established before mixing begins
- **Taking feedback personally** — revision notes are about the product, not your skill
