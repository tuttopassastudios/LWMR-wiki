## Detail

### Real-Time Session Tools

Tools mentioned for remote session monitoring:

> [!quote] Discord Source
> **Author:** cian riordan — **Channel:** #general-talk
> The sanest way I've found is have Audiomovers and everyone listening on headphones. Then have Zoom or FaceTime in addition. I'll have the conversation audio come out of my display speakers and use open-backed headphones so I can hear the mix and the conversation.

- **Audiomovers** — real-time high-quality audio streaming, most recommended
- **Source-Connect** — industry standard for remote recording with low latency
- **ListenTo** — Audiomovers' free alternative for review sessions
- **Zoom/FaceTime** — for communication alongside dedicated audio streaming

### File Sharing Workflows

Practical file exchange discussed:
- **Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer** — standard file delivery tools
- **Splice** — collaborative project sharing with version control
- **File naming conventions** — critical for remote collaboration to avoid confusion
- **Stem delivery standards** — agreed formats prevent miscommunication

### Revision Workflows

Managing remote client feedback:
- Clear revision limits in contracts prevent scope creep
- Timestamped notes preferred over vague feedback
- Reference tracks as shared vocabulary between remote collaborators
- Turnaround time expectations should be explicit from the start

### Best Practices

Community-endorsed remote collaboration principles:
- Over-communicate — what's obvious in person needs to be stated explicitly remotely
- Document agreements in writing (not just voice calls)
- Send reference mixes at multiple stages, not just at completion
- Account for monitoring differences between your room and the client's listening environment
