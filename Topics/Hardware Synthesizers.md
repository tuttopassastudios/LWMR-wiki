# Hardware Synthesizers

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> Hardware synthesizers remain a passionate topic in the community, with discussions centering on whether analog hardware justifies its cost over software alternatives, which synths provide the best value, and how hardware synths integrate into modern DAW-based workflows. The community's perspective: hardware synths are about joy, tactility, and inspiration as much as (or more than) sonic superiority.

## Community Consensus

- **Hardware synths are instruments, not just sound generators** -- The tactile experience fundamentally changes the creative output
- **The [[Sequential Prophet 6]]** is the community's most recommended analog synth
- **Software synths are functionally excellent** but do not inspire the same way
- **Buy the module if you already have a MIDI controller** -- Save money, get the same sound
- **Consider a synth purchase only after your studio fundamentals are sorted** (treatment, monitors, mics)
- **Used market is your friend** -- Hardware synths hold value well, so buying used carries low risk

## The Hardware vs Software Debate

### Why Hardware Wins (For Those Who Choose It)

> [!quote] oaklandmatt
> "Workflow isn't just about efficiency, it's also about joy. I fucking LOVE my Prophet 6 for this reason. I turn it on and it's just fun to play. Every sound is interesting, the build feels super solid, and tons of useful knobs at your fingertips."

> [!quote] Rollmottle
> "Plugins are nice, but nothing beats that immediate tactility of hardware. I coveted a Prophet for so long and it does pads better than most plugins I've heard."

> [!quote] Zack Hames
> "Soft synths don't give that for me. It's truly an instrument -- inspiring to play."

Key arguments:
- **Tactile interaction** -- Turning real knobs creates a fundamentally different creative experience than clicking a mouse
- **Immediate sonic response** -- No menu diving, no presets to scroll
- **Joy factor** -- Multiple members cite "fun" and "inspiration" as primary reasons
- **Pads and evolving sounds** are where hardware analog particularly excels
- **No CPU load** -- Complex patches do not tax your DAW

### Where Software Wins
- **Cost**: $150 for a plugin vs $2,500 for hardware
- **Recall**: Software sessions reopen perfectly; hardware settings must be photographed or manually logged
- **Variety**: One plugin subscription gives access to dozens of synth emulations
- **Portability**: Laptop-based production
- **Headroom concerns**: "A lot of virtual synths eat up a ton of headroom" -- NoahNeedleman (though this cuts both ways)

## Recommended Hardware Synths

### Analog Polysynths

| Synth | Price Range | Community Notes |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| [[Sequential Prophet 6]] | ~$2,500 new | Community #1 pick. "If I had to have ONE synth it's this one. Be all end all for analog synth sounds" -- Zack Hames. "Every sound is interesting" -- oaklandmatt |
| [[Sequential Prophet Rev2]] | ~$1,500-2,000 new | "Slightly deeper synth than the Prophet 6... save a little $$$ and still get that analog sound" -- joebegalla. Module version available used for ~$1,100 |
| [[Sequential Prophet 5]] | ~$3,500 new | Reissue of the classic. The Prophet 6 can "cop classic Prophet 5 sounds pretty well" |

### Other Synths Mentioned

| Synth | Price Range | Community Notes |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| [[Moog Slim Phatty]] | Used $500-700 | Monophonic, classic Moog sound. Part of Zack Hames's collection |
| [[Korg MS-20]] | ~$500 (Mini) | Semi-modular, aggressive character. Gets regular use alongside the Prophet |
| [[Korg Electribe]] | Used $200-400 | Sequencer/groovebox, fun for experimentation |
| [[Roland Juno]] (module) | Used $300-800 | Classic pads and strings |
| [[Novation UltraNova]] | Used $300-500 | Digital but hands-on. Part of the "affordable synth rabbit hole" |

### Sequential Prophet 6 Deep Dive
The community's most endorsed synth deserves extra detail:
- **Analog oscillators** with digital control -- Best of both worlds
- **Built-in effects** (delay, distortion, reverb) that are genuinely useful
- **Immediate** -- Every knob does something, no menu diving
- **Versatile** -- Pads, leads, bass, sound design
- **Build quality** praised by every owner in the community
- **Holds value** well on the used market

> [!quote] Zack Hames
> "Recently bought a Prophet 6 a few months ago, and it really is a be all end all for analog synth sounds. The quality is top notch, does EXACTLY what you want it to do / expect. Can't recommend it enough."

## Module vs Keyboard

> [!quote] Rollmottle
> "If you have a MIDI keyboard already, you can save yourself the bread and get the synth module without the keyboard. I got my Rev2 used for like $1,100."

### Module Advantages
- Significantly cheaper (often $500-1,000 less)
- Takes up less space
- Use your existing controller keyboard
- Same exact sound engine

### Keyboard Advantages
- Integrated experience, no MIDI configuration needed
- Aftertouch and keybed quality matched to the synth
- Self-contained instrument for performance
- Better resale value in some cases

## Integration with DAW Workflow

### MIDI Recording
- Record MIDI from the hardware synth into your DAW
- This allows editing note data while using the hardware sound engine
- Requires keeping the synth connected and powered during mixing

### Audio Recording (Print)
- Record the audio output of the synth into your DAW
- Commit the sound early in the process
- No need to keep synth connected during mixing
- Use high-quality DI or line input for recording

### Hybrid Approach
- Record MIDI and audio simultaneously
- Use MIDI for editing, audio for the committed sound
- Re-record from MIDI if patch changes are needed

## The Investment Question

> [!quote] NoahNeedleman
> "I'm thinking about grabbing a Prophet 6 but wondering if you guys have thoughts on $150 for a plug-in vs $2,500 for analog."

The community's answer is nuanced:
- **If you will play it regularly** and it inspires you, the hardware investment is justified
- **If you just need sounds**, software is more practical and cost-effective
- **Consider used** -- The Prophet Rev2 module at $1,100 used is a very different proposition than $2,500 new for a Prophet 6
- **Factor in your studio priorities** -- Do not buy a synth before treating your room or upgrading monitors

> [!quote] Slow Hand
> "If you're working as an audio engineer... my vote is that you spend a fraction of that to invest in getting your room dialed in with some acoustic treatment."

## Common Debates

### Analog vs Digital Hardware
- **Analog purists** value the continuous voltage oscillators and filter behavior
- **Digital hardware** (Novation, Elektron) offers more features and recall at lower prices
- **Hybrid** synths (Prophet Rev2, some Moogs) combine analog signal paths with digital control
- The community does not have a strong dogmatic position -- "use what inspires you"

### One Expensive Synth vs Several Cheap Ones
- Zack Hames went through the "affordable synth rabbit hole" (Roland Juno module, Moog Slim Phatty, Korg MS-20, Korg Electribe, Novation UltraNova) before settling on the Prophet 6 and MS-20 as his primary instruments
- The lesson: a few well-chosen pieces get more use than a large collection of compromises

### Hardware Synths as Studio Investments
- Quality hardware synths hold value extremely well
- Some vintage synths appreciate (Juno-106, Prophet 5, etc.)
- "I always try to get discounts or buy used so when I sell later I don't lose much" -- Josh

## Tips from the Community

- Try before you buy -- If possible, visit a dealer and play the actual instrument
- Buy used and sell without losing money if it does not work out
- The module version of any synth sounds identical to the keyboard version -- save the money if you have a controller
- Hardware synths excel at sounds that evolve over time (pads, textures, drones) -- This is where analog particularly shines over digital
- Keep patch notes or use a patch librarian to save your sounds
- Consider the Prophet Rev2 as a more affordable entry into the Sequential ecosystem

## Common Mistakes

- **Buying a hardware synth before sorting studio fundamentals** (room treatment, monitors, microphones)
- **Expecting hardware to make soft synth sounds obsolete** -- Both have their place
- **Not budgeting for audio integration** -- You need converter channels and cables to get audio from the synth into your DAW
- **Buying too many budget synths** instead of one excellent one
- **Neglecting MIDI configuration** and ending up with a frustrating workflow
- **Not playing the synth** -- If it sits unused because your workflow is entirely ITB, it was not the right purchase
