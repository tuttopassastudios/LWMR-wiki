## Channel Description

The #pro-tools channel is the dedicated space for Pro Tools-specific discussions — SoundFlow scripting and automation, Beat Detective drum editing, playlist/comping deep dives, folder and routing architecture, version-specific bugs, MIDI workflows, HEAT, and session organization philosophy. Unlike #daw-talk (which covers cross-DAW comparison), this channel is focused exclusively on Pro Tools workflows. The single richest topic thread is SoundFlow scripting, led by Tristan's deep advocacy and custom script development. The channel has a strong practical focus with many detailed workflow threads and troubleshooting discussions. Bryan DiMaio is the most prolific contributor, bridging SoundFlow with both Logic and Pro Tools workflows.

## Key Findings

1. **SoundFlow is the single most discussed topic** — Tristan's deep SoundFlow advocacy, custom stem printing scripts, Bounce Factory, and Forte export tool dominate the automation discussion. SoundFlow is described as "80-90% JavaScript" with a community forum for shared scripts. Using AI/GPT to help write SoundFlow scripts is an emerging practice.
2. **Beat Detective remains essential for drum editing** — Zack Hames' detailed drum editing workflows, sethmanchester's "record at slower BPM, beat detect, speed back up" trick, and Adam Thein's stray-track fixes demonstrate continued heavy use despite the tool's age.
3. **Playlist comping is deep and nuanced** — EliHeathMusic's pinned comping shortcuts, dual-mic vocal recording workflow challenges, jerikcenteno's playlist color coding, and Matthew The Cooke's Cut Time playlist limitation (doesn't move alternate playlists) reveal that PT's comping system has significant depth and some edge-case limitations.
4. **PT's internal bus doesn't clip audibly but exports can** — Josh Bowman discovered that Pro Tools' internal buses don't produce audible clipping during playback, but the same signal exported at 24-bit will produce destroyed audio. This is critical knowledge for gain staging.
5. **Version updates are a minefield** — PT 2024.3 introduced an aux routing delay bug, 2024.6 had a playlist view crash (Ctrl+Cmd+arrow), M4 Macs get Rosetta assertion errors on new track creation. Community consensus: PT 2023.9 is the stability sweet spot.
6. **HEAT usage is declining** — Community discussion reveals HEAT was popular when introduced but usage has dropped. Will Melones' channel strip questions and montrose recording's "insufficient DSP" errors on blank sessions suggest the feature has maintenance issues.
7. **Folder/routing architecture is evolving** — Matthew The Cooke's exploration of folder-as-aux-bus, Routing Folders discussion, and internal routing preservation challenges show PT's folder system catching up to but not yet matching competitors.
8. **Session corruption recovery has a clear workflow** — Ross Fortune's protocol: shift-open (disable all plugins), reactivate plugins slowly one by one to isolate the corrupted plugin. This is the community's go-to recovery technique.
9. **MIDI in Pro Tools remains a secondary workflow** — MIDI quantization limitations (selective subdivisions), the undo double-tap bug (jerikcenteno), orchestral latency offset workarounds (BatMeckley), and arrangement markers workaround (andrew_yv) all confirm that MIDI is functional but not PT's strength.
