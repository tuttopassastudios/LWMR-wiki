## Channel Description

The #songwriting-talk channel is **oaklandmatt's passion channel** — created on April 2, 2021 with the statement "I might have more thoughts on songwriting than mixing and producing tbh." With 1,933 messages spanning nearly five years, it is the vault's **dedicated songwriting discussion space**, covering lyrics, melody, co-writing, creative process, song structure, and songwriting philosophy.

Unlike the technically focused mixing, recording, and mastering channels, #songwriting-talk is almost entirely **philosophical and craft-oriented**. The largest category is Lyrics & Lyric Writing (304 messages), followed by Demos & Song Production (187), Vocal Performance & Delivery (182), and Instrument-Based Composition (169). The channel's defining philosophy is **lyrics-first songwriting** — oaklandmatt's repeated emphasis that "all the A level songwriters I've worked with are super lyric forward" and Rob Domos's transformative "incriminate yourself" principle.

The channel is notably intimate and personal compared to the higher-volume technical channels. oaklandmatt's messages average 377 characters — the highest average length of any top contributor in any channel — reflecting the depth and care with which he discusses his primary creative passion. The channel spawned the #song-a-week forum exercise (January 2023), which became a community-wide songwriting practice initiative.

**Activity by year:** 2021: 376 | 2022: 205 | 2023: 711 | 2024: 339 | 2025: 231 | 2026: 71

## Active Debates

- **Lyrics first vs melody first** — oaklandmatt strongly advocates lyrics-first, while Rob Domos notes Alan Burgman (legendary lyricist) prefers melody first; the channel leans toward lyrics-first but acknowledges both paths
- **Writing for yourself vs writing for pitch** — tension between artistic authenticity and commercial placement; oaklandmatt advises "think about it in your prep and production, completely ignoring it when you're creating"
- **Solo writing vs co-writing** — oaklandmatt notes "people marinating on songs over time is mostly artists who write by themselves (Leonard Cohen, Tom Petty, Frank Ocean)" while co-writing moves faster; NoahNeedleman embraces his identity as "The Helper" who thrives in collaboration rather than solo creation
- **Slant rhymes** — Rob Domos and Alan Burgman's family debated "phonetic tension and release" at Thanksgiving dinner; generational divide between traditional and modern lyric conventions
- **Songwriting practice vs production practice** — oaklandmatt (2026-02-14) strongly advises separating: "avoid any production at all when doing songwriting practice... trying to also do production will only slow you down"

## Key Quotes

> "Write embarrassingly honest songs about your life. What's exciting you stressing you making you sad making you uncomfortable etc. PS, all the A level songwriters I've worked with are super lyric forward. Most people think it's finding a melody then writing lyrics to it, but 90% of the great writers I know are putting their feelings into words well before they're getting on the mic."

> [!quote] Rob Domos (2021-04-26) — 16 reactions
> "I once got in a lonnnnnnnnng philosophical conversation with this mastering engineer who was mentoring me back when I was still an artist and he gave me the best assignment ever. He said 'I want you to incriminate yourself. Write whatever you least want people to hear from you.' I did and it was the best response I'd ever gotten on something I'd made at that point. It completely changed the way I write."

> [!quote] oaklandmatt (2024-03-23) — 17 reactions
> "I would focus almost all your energy on becoming a better, more truthful, richer lyricist. That's the only place you'll be original because there's only one you. Paradoxically, it's also the way you'll write songs that have a universal appeal because the more personal you get, the more the underlying universal emotions will resonate with people."

> [!quote] oaklandmatt (2023-02-16) — 16 reactions (pinned)
> "Some songwriting-related morning routine thoughts: I've been starting my day with doing piano scales and vocal warm ups to a metronome and then singing/learning a song and recording a voice note of it. Hard to know for sure if it's causal, but my songwriting abilities have sped up. I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks."

> [!quote] Slow Hand (2023-01-01) — 45 reactions
> "We've instituted a new forum #song-a-week for what will be the first of a weekly songwriting exercise that we now invite you to participate in. This is an opportunity to flex your songwriting muscles and share your work with your peers."

> [!quote] oaklandmatt (2023-02-19) — 15 reactions
> "The best songs are never calculated, they're always just felt as they're being created. They are magical/incalculable moments. As soon as people start analyzing — 'is this too generic?' 'maybe we should have a part like *insert artist*' — the song loses its magic. But the paradox is that you can't just sit around and wait for them to happen. You have to be in motion."

> [!quote] Rob Domos (2023-11-24) — 12 reactions
> "Just had thanksgiving dinner at Alan Burgman's house... He's 98 years old and has written lyrics for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Aretha Franklin. 'Writers these days are more interested in immediate appeal than they are in a great song. They aren't the same thing. A great song is only a great song if people will want to cover it in 30 years.'"
