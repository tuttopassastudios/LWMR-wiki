## Community Consensus

- **Always get your money up front** — oaklandmatt's pinned advice, near-universal agreement; backend royalties are unreliable
- **The $100 client has 84 mix notes, the $100k client says "rad!"** — consistent observation that lower-budget clients are more demanding
- **Only ~30 out of hundreds/thousands of projects actually pay royalties** — the harsh reality of backend deals
- **LLC is almost always the right first step** — community agrees on LLC before considering S-Corp complexity
- **Networking at venues beats posting rates online** — organic relationship building is more effective than transactional marketing
- **Never accept a publishing buyout** — strong consensus that publishing rights are too valuable to sell

## Active Debates

- **When to work for free or cheap** — ehutton21 and cypress advocate strategic free work for relationship building; oaklandmatt cautions against devaluing services
- **Hourly vs project-based pricing** — community split on which model works better; consensus trending toward project-based for mixing
- **Whether streaming is viable for indie artists** — longstoryshort presents data showing extreme consolidation; others see niche opportunities
- **S-Corp timing** — Rollmottle provides framework but acknowledges the break-even varies by state and situation

## Notes

- This channel represents almost entirely new territory for the vault — prior business content was limited to [[DAW Pricing and Licensing]] which focuses narrowly on software costs
- oaklandmatt's contributions carry particular weight as the server owner and working professional mixer/producer
- The channel's tone is notably direct and practical — less theoretical debate than technical channels, more "here's what actually happens"
- Rollmottle's business structure knowledge is exceptionally detailed, rivaling professional tax consultation advice
- International perspectives (mixedbywong_my) provide valuable contrast to the US-centric default
- Late 2024–2025 saw increased streaming skepticism as consolidation data became more widely shared
- Strong overlap with #recording-talk contributors discussing the business side of session work
