# cubase Channel Summary

## Overview

> [!info]
> Summary of the **#cubase** channel from the **Live with Matt Rad** Discord server. This is the dedicated Cubase channel (separate from #daw-talk) covering deep Cubase-specific workflow tips, troubleshooting, feature discussion, and community debugging. The channel captures the community's experience across Cubase 12, 13, 14, and early 15, with extensive Logical Editor, VariAudio, and ARA integration discussion.

## Channel Description

The #cubase channel is the dedicated space for Cubase-specific discussions — workflow tips, Logical Editor/PLE mastery, VariAudio techniques, ARA troubleshooting, and version migration advice. Unlike #daw-talk (which covers cross-DAW comparison and general DAW topics), this channel is focused exclusively on Cubase and Nuendo workflows. The channel has a very high substantive rate (81%) and attracts the server's most active Cubase power users, led by Joel "Roomie" Berghult's prolific contributions across modulators, MIDI, and version transitions. Notable threads include deep Logical Editor preset sharing, VariAudio vs Melodyne shootouts, Cubase 14 feature evaluation, and early Cubase 15 reception.

## Key Findings

1. **Logical Editor is Cubase's killer feature** — LAPhill, SoundsLikeJoe, and Jeff Dunne demonstrate that the Logical Editor and PLE provide MIDI manipulation capabilities unmatched by other DAWs; Greg Ondo's shared presets are a community resource
2. **VariAudio vs Melodyne is a workflow choice, not a quality choice** — Community consensus holds that both tools are excellent; VariAudio wins for speed and integration, Melodyne for polyphonic and fine control. Lee Rouse's multi-tool workflow (VA → Auto-Tune → Melodyne) is the power-user approach
3. **ARA integration remains unreliable** — Melodyne clicks/pops at region boundaries and Auto-Tune ARA crashes are persistent issues across Cubase 13 and 14. The recommended workaround is to commit early or bounce in place before ARA processing
4. **Cubase 14 was well received** — Modulators, mixer reordering, blob editing, and PT-style clip gain addressed long-standing community requests. M4 efficiency core support improved performance on Apple Silicon
5. **Cubase 15 reception is cautious** — Expression maps revision and pattern engine melodic mode are welcome, but known bugs (nudge bar) led to community consensus of waiting for the first maintenance update
6. **CC121 + Stream Deck is a powerful combination** — Jeff Dunne's detailed workflow shows how dedicated Steinberg hardware combined with Stream Deck and Logical Editor presets creates an efficient tactile control surface
7. **Nuendo required for ADM import** — Jemody's investigation confirmed that Cubase cannot import ADM files (Dolby Atmos), requiring a Nuendo license for immersive audio post-production
8. **Stock plugins are underrated** — SoundsLikeJoe's blind test showed Retrologue competing with uHe Diva, and Magneto II has a direct lineage to SPL Machine Head hardware
