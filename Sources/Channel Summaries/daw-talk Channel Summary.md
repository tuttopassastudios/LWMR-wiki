## Key Findings

1. **All DAWs sum identically** — confirmed by null tests and technical analysis from multiple experts (ALXCPH, oaklandmatt, Slow Hand)
2. **Pro Tools leads CPU efficiency** — M1 benchmarks show PT > Reaper > Logic > Ableton for track playback (Adam Thein, 2023)
3. **Ableton's export workflow is widely criticized** — requires cumbersome freeze/flatten/rename process (austenballard, Slow Hand)
4. **Multi-DAW workflows are common** — many professionals produce in Ableton and mix in Pro Tools
5. **Apple Silicon transition was significant** — Logic went native first, causing temporary plugin compatibility issues
6. **Session templates save enormous time** — SoundFlow scripting automates Pro Tools mix prep (Nacho Sotelo)
7. **Melodyne/VocAlign can cause timing issues in Ableton** — discovered by Rob Domos
