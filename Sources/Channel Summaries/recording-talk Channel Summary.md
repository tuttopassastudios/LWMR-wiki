## Channel Description

The #recording-talk channel covers all aspects of practical recording and tracking -- drum miking, guitar/bass/vocal tracking, mic placement, stereo techniques, amp recording, room acoustics for tracking, headphone mixes, and the interpersonal side of running recording sessions. The community skews heavily toward experienced working engineers with deep hands-on recording knowledge. Unlike #gear-talk (which focuses on equipment itself) and #daw-talk (which focuses on software workflows), #recording-talk is about the craft of capturing sound in the studio.

## Pinned Messages

The channel has 4 pinned messages capturing core recording philosophy:

1. **cian riordan (2022-06-28):** Detailed drum overhead approach -- L-C-R method with center mic as the anchor, sides as cymbal mics. Emphasis on phase checking and constant adjustment.

2. **Ross Fortune (2023-02-24):** Voice remedies guide -- peppermint tea, salt gargle, steam, ginger. Compiled from multiple community members including BatMeckley.

3. **Edward Rivera (2023-08-17):** Albini's drum tuning method -- knock on shell to find natural resonance, tune batter head to that pitch. Classical (same pitch both heads), jazz (resonant higher), rock (resonant lower).

4. **BatMeckley (2024-02-28):** "Don't be a wuss when recording" -- Commit to sounds during tracking, don't sacrifice quality out of fear. Singers benefit from analog compression on the way in.

## Key Findings

1. **Drum recording dominates the channel** -- More than 1,800 substantive messages, with cian riordan as the acknowledged expert ("the drum master here and pretty much everywhere" -- BatMeckley)
2. **Session mindset is as valued as technical skill** -- The most-reacted messages are about interpersonal skills, not microphone placement
3. **The community favors bold, committed recording** -- Printing compression, committing to tones, and not "kicking the can down the road" to mixing
4. **Room quality is the #1 recurring theme** -- Whether discussing drums, piano, or ambient recording, the room itself matters more than any mic
5. **Polar pattern selection is an underutilized tool** -- BatMeckley's observation about figure-8 on guitar cabs resonated strongly
6. **Phase alignment is non-negotiable** -- Checking polarity and phase between every mic pair is considered fundamental, not optional
7. **API preamps are the consensus choice for drums** -- Multiple engineers advocate specifically for API on drum sessions
