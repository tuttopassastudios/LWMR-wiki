# show-your-setup Channel Summary

## Overview

> [!info]
> Summary of the **#📸show-your-setup** channel from the **Live with Matt Rad** Discord server. This is the community's studio photo and gear showcase channel — a visual documentation of how members design, build, and evolve their production environments. Unlike DAW or technique channels, this channel focuses on physical studio spaces and gear in context.

## Channel Description

The #📸show-your-setup channel was created by oaklandmatt on February 8, 2021 with the opening message: "let's see some pics of yalls setups! mix stations, mic'ing setups, full studio pics, favorite guitars, whatever!" Over five years, it has become the community's primary visual documentation space — a running gallery of studio builds, gear acquisitions, ergonomic experiments, and workspace evolution.

The channel is uniquely photo-heavy (1,814 image attachments) and conversational, with members sharing build progress over months or years. Several studio construction projects have been documented from ground-breaking to completion (Eric Martin, peterlabberton, Zack Hames). The community's acoustic design consultant Gerhard Westphalen has designed rooms for multiple members, making this channel an informal case study library for studio acoustics.

The channel's substantive rate (60.7%) is lower than more technical channels like #daw-talk (92%) or #cubase (81%) because many messages are short reactions to photos, encouragement, or social responses. However, the substantive messages contain rich practical content about room design, treatment results, gear integration, and workflow optimization.

## Key Findings

1. **The tiny desk movement is the channel's defining trend** — Members consistently report dramatic acoustic improvements (measured via REW) after downsizing studio desks. bobby k's $100 DIY desk, Josh Bowman's closet-shelf desk, and nachomaquieira's shift to side racks all confirm: less furniture = better sound.

2. **Gerhard Westphalen is the community's acoustician** — Multiple members (bobby k, Adam Thein, Eric Martin, Zack Hames, Jasper Boogaard, jonmatteson) commissioned room designs from Gerhard. His custom speaker installation (64 reactions) is the all-time most-reacted post.

3. **Multi-year build documentation is unique content** — Eric Martin (concrete block to finished studio, 2023-2024), peterlabberton (studio house, 2025-2026), and Zack Hames (basement to SSL studio, 2023-2026) documented their entire build journeys, creating an informal construction case study library.

4. **Treatment trumps gear — proven visually** — Before/after studio photos combined with REW measurements provide visual evidence for the community's core advice: invest in room treatment before gear upgrades.

5. **Console ownership is becoming a statement** — Zack Hames' SSL 6040 E (52 reactions) and cian riordan's response ("you just flew a 'I'm not fucking around' flag") show that console acquisition is increasingly seen as a career commitment signal rather than a purely technical decision.

6. **Accessibility determines gear usage** — P.K. Stephan's philosophy ("I only use the stuff that I can access quickly") is reinforced across the channel. Studios where everything is always connected and patchbay-accessible see more outboard usage.

7. **The channel is unusually positive** — Unlike more debate-heavy channels, #show-your-setup is predominantly supportive. High-reaction posts are milestones (build completions, console acquisitions, new rooms) that receive community celebration.
