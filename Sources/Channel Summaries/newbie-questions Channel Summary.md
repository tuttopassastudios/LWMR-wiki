## Channel Description

The #newbie-questions channel is a **beginner-focused Q&A channel** on the Live with Matt Rad server. It serves as the entry point for new members to ask questions without judgment — from "where do I start?" to "what gear should I buy?" to "how loud should my master be?" The channel is notable for its high ratio of expert respondents to beginners: 54% of substantive messages come from VERIFIED_EXPERTS, meaning beginners in this channel receive reliable, professional-grade advice.

Unlike #mixing-talk or #recording-talk where professionals discuss technique among peers, #newbie-questions has a distinct teacher-student dynamic. The community's most experienced engineers actively participate here, answering fundamental questions with patience and depth. oaklandmatt set the tone with the channel's creation: "This is why we have a newbie question channel! ❤️" (16 reactions).

**Critical note:** While BoozleBAM is the most active poster (~1,098 substantive messages), they are a dedicated learner and questioner — not an advice source. Their questions are valuable as representative beginner concerns, but their answers should not be treated as authoritative.

**Activity by year:** 2021: 1,108 | 2022: 1,010 | 2023: 2,139 | 2024: 3,090 | 2025: 2,071 | 2026: 441

## Community Consensus

- **48kHz is the recommended sample rate** — Nomograph Mastering's pinned post (59 reactions) gives the definitive answer: film/TV prefer it, converters handle it efficiently, and there's no audible benefit to higher rates for most record-making
- **Be critical of expensive gear marketed to beginners** — cian riordan: "Be critical of things that are expensive for the sake of being expensive. Things that are just instagram ads shilling to newbies" (23 reactions, pinned)
- **Just do the reps** — cian riordan: "just do the reps. Mix your stuff, mix your friends' stuff" (21 reactions); hyanrarvey: "You'll learn more about mixing by recording an album and then mixing that album than any youtube video or class" (9 reactions)
- **Taste matters more than gear** — BatMeckley: "Most decent mics CAN get you where you want to go, they just take a little different approach" (18 reactions, pinned)
- **Get money up front, but stay busy** — cian riordan: "I would rather be slammed busy mixing below my ideal rate than making a higher rate doing less work" (16 reactions)
- **Gain staging is about optimal gain at every stage** — Slow Hand's detailed explanation covers recording through mastering (11 reactions)
- **Car test is essential** — oaklandmatt: "the car is a great counterbalance to the context and precision of the studio" (7 reactions)
- **Dropbox tip: change 0 to 1 at end of link for direct download** — cian riordan (13 reactions, pinned)

## Active Debates

- **How loud should masters be for streaming?** — Ongoing tension between targeting -14 LUFS for Spotify normalization vs mastering louder for competitive playback
- **Condenser vs dynamic for first mic** — SM7B vs AT2020/Rode NT1 debate, with experts noting room treatment matters more than mic choice for beginners
- **When to work for free** — Range from "never" to cian riordan's view that staying busy at lower rates builds momentum
- **Do beginners need acoustic treatment?** — Experts consistently say yes but acknowledge budget constraints; foam is universally panned as ineffective

> "If I was asked 'What sample rate should people make records at in 2022?' And was forced to choose then the answer would be 48k. Why? Film and TV prefer it, converters handle it efficiently, and there's no audible benefit to higher rates for most record-making."
