    "content": "Aside from the usual discussion about headphone preferences and HRTF, I\u2019ll give you my experience with them.\n\nI bought them a few years ago with the intention of just having a baller set of headphones for a bunch of travel I had coming up. I had tried them once at @oaklandmatt\u2019s place and wasn\u2019t super impressed... just thought they sounded like hyped headphones. But I really wanted something with killer noise cancellation and something to potentially reference Spatial mixes. After purchasing, the more I used them, the more I fell in love with listening to music on them. I realized quite early on that there was a lot of parity between how things sounded in the APMaxes vs. my PMC 6-2s\u2026 similar low end presentation, similar high end. But just genuinely enjoyed listening to music on them.\n\nI was traveling for thanksgiving last year and a last minute mix opportunity came up for some video game trailer. Not my normal speed but they were up shits creek with a deadline and the money was good\u2026 so I mixed the whole thing start to finish on my laptop with the Airpods. I was a little sheepish about sending off un-vetted mixes, but the clients loved it and I saved the day. I curiously took a listen when I got back to my studio after the holiday and was very surprised that the mix was 98% there. There was maybe a small low end tweak I could\u2019ve made, but by and large, the mixes translated incredibly well. \n\nNow I use them much more for odd tasks, usually revisions and printing sessions. I can be on my couch on my laptop running files down with transparency mode on, still hanging with my family while watching a show, and lock in with noise cancelling when I need to focus.\n\nFor $600 they\u2019ve been a massive value-add to my work flow.",

    "content": "So obviously starting with the right bass is going to get you 70% of the way there, but you know what *really* surprised the hell out of me? The *strings*. \n\nIf you're not getting anywhere close to the tone that you want, start exploring the wide world of bass strings. I had overlooked this simple thing for ages. I took my choice of strings for granted because I never had to change them. And when I did it made all of the difference in my tone.\n\nI've always been a Fender guy: P-basses and J-Basses, and the DI signal was always voiced way too dark to pop out of a mix without some heavy lifting. Granted I also use flatwounds (which aren't as zippy as roundwounds). \n\nAfter some research on the TalkBass forum, I ordered a few different sets of flats to experiment. One such set were the *Thomastik-Infeld Jazz Flats*, and ho-lee *shit*. There it was. There was the sound I was looking for.\n\nThey were voiced way lighter in the bass, which gave me a far more articulate midrange. Like the sound of an upright bass which (trust me) is a very good quality to have unless you're going for a grindy metal tone. As it turns out, the midrange is where *all* of the action is in the bass. It's okay if your bass DI is voiced with no low-end, because you can always add that weight back in, but if the midrange is not present to begin with it is an uphill battle to make it articulate in a mix.",

    "content": "I've been a \"musician\" since way before i started recording and producing stuff. (Since i was 4 i think). It's such an integral part of how music can feel and make you move. Think about how someone like Anderson paak. can make you dance by just playing 8th notes on a highhat and nothing else(see tinydesk for ref.) or Pino Paladino, will make you break your neck with his bass, playing simple Quater notes. (anything D'angelo).  Even in a genre that is as quantized and on the grid as it gets like a lot of hiphop/trap is, notice how the artist(rappers) that really stand out, are the ones that make those beats really groove/hit because of how they themselves \"groove\" or flow on those beats. They might be slightly behind or in front of the beat, or they might even swing a little. \n\nYou can really get into the micro and macro dynamics of groove. Listen to guys like Led zeppelin, how they might start out a song a few BPM slower than they finish, because of the build up of energy through out the song, and it doesn't sound wrong or unnatural. \n\nA fun thing to do, when looking for inspiration for grooves, is record some foley, and look for naturally occurring rhythms in the sample. Try and build a grove around that probably a bit wonky rhythm. It can really be an eye opening experience once you realise how much fun rhythm and groove is, when you don't have to obey the grid in a daw like a machine. \n\nBut like anything music, it's really about listening and feeling. Really internalising what a forward or laid back snare feels like or a bass thats almost a 16th behind the beat.",

Together they create a single melodic voice.\n\n**2) **How do the instruments stack on each other? Do they clash? Cellos doubling a bass an octave up extend it's timbre into a higher register to make it read better. It's not so different from adding fuzz to an 808 so that it has more presence.\n\n**3) **Which instrument will cut through the music?\n\n---\n\nA few concepts that I'll add:\n\n**4) **Instruments in the foreground vs. the background. Know which part is the lead (focal point) at any given point in the record and then pare down the presence of the rest and push it into the back of the sound stage.\n\n**5)** (Piggybacking off of Felix's excellent post) What is the simplest way to achieve the desired effect? Reduce. Reduce. Reduce.\n\nCut instruments and parts ruthlessly and approach it with a minimalist's eye. Like writing a haiku: How few elements can you use to create an impression? Maybe a guitar part is carrying 90% of the groove and the drums only need to be a kick and a snare. Or maybe the guitar is covering the backbeat too, and you don't even need a snare!\n\nConstantly ask yourself \"What is the most important sensation in the record?\" and then focus it by cutting out everything that gets in the way.\n\n**6)** Hocketing. Pass the melody off between different instruments at different points in the song. Play it in different registers. Combine voices occasionally for special effect.\n\n**7)** Tonal contrast. Dark instruments plus bright instruments. Distorted and clean together. Near vs. distant.\n\nElements that sound same-y will gel together and elements that contrast tonally will pop.",

For intervals other than a 5th, it's not an octave below but some other pitch, and so yeah, you're likely creating unpleasant harmonics outside of the key.\n\nThe dumbest, but easiest way to avoid that is to let the bass be the inversion's lowest note while the plays a 5th from the root note. Otherwise, you're looking at dialing back the distortion on those inversions, or on the tone as a whole, which isn't necessarily what's desired.",

You need to line up your edits so the wave form is perfect in the middle of each note, then use an equal gain cross fade at the edit point. This gives you the most transparency because there is no algorithmic stretching happening. \n\nIt limits very slightly your options with timing because bass wave forms are long, so lining them up perfectly means you can only move the timing the length of each waveform. It's also time consuming compared to stretching.\n\nIf you are editing a DI that is then going through significant processing (amp sims and shit), you can sometimes get away with one of the stretching algorithms. Elastic audio is ok and usable sometimes, but I prefer Ableton's complex mode over everything else I've heard.\n\nI try to avoid time stretching artifacts on lead vocals and bass instruments more than anything else (unless it's creatively interesting of course).",

This is for \"correlated\" signals where the waveform is lining up exactly. A bass guitar, the middle of a vocal note, a synth with a consistent waveform, etc.\n\nWhen you're doing a crossfade on noise (breaths, sss's, ambience between drum hits, etc), you want equal power because these \"uncorrelated\" signals need a bit of boost around the crossfade for the perceived loudness to be the same.\n\nYou can check this by using a synth note or long vocal note, doing an edit to make it longer or shorter, lining up the waveforms perfectly, and doing a cross fade. You will find that equal power causes a volume bump. Equal gain will be smooth.\n\nDo the same thing with white noise and this time equal power will be smooth, while equal gain will cause a volume dip.",

Everything sounds incredible and is dripping with character. It's absurdly capable, but the interface may be overwhelming at first. It can be a lot to get oriented on. It's impossible for this thing to sound \"cold\". The preset library is less bass music/EDM and more balanced. NI offers a lot of genre-themed expansions. If you like programming sequenced/heavily automated one-button patches Massive X is king.\n\nSerum is on the \"cold\" side, but just as capable of \"warmer\" sounds. The sonics and DSP are clear as a bell. Stellar. It's more intuitive to program and the feature set is an embarrassment of riches. It's absurd how much functionality Steve and team crammed into it. Absolutely absurd. If you want to do EDM and bass music, it's the king and it's preset library leans towards that. I still cannot believe that they *gave* it away to Serum 1 users.\n\nBoth excel at cinematic and over the top. If you're looking for the \"classic\" sound, I'd lean Massive X.",

    "content": "Sooo, on the recording side of things: if you\u2019re going DI, most interfaces do not have a high enough input impedance to do passive pickups justice, especially if you want a decent amount of low end. Guitar pickups sound good with 1-2MOhm(the input impedance of a good tube amp), but if I want really clear modern low end that can compete with 808s, then I\u2019ve had the best results with around 10MOhm on passive bass pickups. Another important thing is a transistor-based active DI will not get you a full low end. You will end up re-amping or using amp emulations etc. Octal tubes(the type of tubes IN the B15) will. Octal tubes have a lot more body(think U47, for example) and will get you there much much quicker. I have a Sarno V8, which isn\u2019t perfect, but sounds clean, \u201cfinished\u201d and modern from the get-go. No compression or emulations needed.

There's so much overlap between the feature set and if you can get very intuitive with one synth you'll go so much farther.\n\nBack in the day I bought NI's *Komplete* bundle and it was just way too many new instruments too fast. Too many options. I never got to know any of them very well. Most synths have all of the same features that you'll want, but there's still a learning curve for every single one that you have to get over before you can be really expressive. I wish it were as easy as picking up a guitar or a horn where everything is standardized and lies in the same place. But that's part of what makes synths great: Their plasticity.\n\nNowadays the only synths I reach for (unless I need a very specific sound) are *Massive X*, *Razor*, and my Moog Sub 37. The first two are very different and don't share many features. I use the Moog when I don't want to be tethered to my computer. Limiting my available tools has been a net benefit for me.",

Then playing with some subtle percussion elements like triangle, clave, wood blocks, to differentiate later choruses.",

I always find the impact lessened when I do. Something about a lack of confidence in the low end makes me like the song less. There are exceptions but they are rare imo. And I hardly ever let the down beats of transitions be off grid too. I usually want the sections to be obvious. I also start with going behind the beat first. I have also recently in the last year or so found that if I start with getting the very basic part of the groove right first, I am less likely to overcrowd my production. So before I put hats in, I\u2019ll just put in snare and kick and try and find the groove with just those 2 elements (unless there is some other clear rhythmic element at play) but I feel like if you can\u2019t feel the groove with just the kick and (snare/clap/perc) then it\u2019s not there.",

I've had guitars recorded loosely toa click and worked the groove around that - lining up the downbeats of the drums/bass  with the guitars even if it's a bit early or late. that was for a more indie type of joint. and for something more trap /modern hip hop, I've nudged bass notes or samples to get them to either sync w drums up for impact  or nudge slightly off to hype of of pull back the energy in the groove. \n\nas far as programming. I'll play with forward swing and dragging notes a lot if I'm going for a more real/dynamic feel when programming. keeping in mind that if the goal is trying to stay \"on time\" any fwd swing that might happen at the start of a phrase will be compensated with some drag  after or vice versa.  keeping velocities in mind w drum hits + linking it to a filter env so that harder hits have more high end and softer hits end up a bit rounder.\n\nadding subtle layers that are similar   to the main drums but occupy a different texture or tone  in dif  sections to thicken up the groove or automate the attack /sustain of certain elements thru diff sections to help shift the listener  focus throughout",

    "content": "(Ok. Now I'm starting to run with this train of thought. Now would be a good time to step off if you've gotten what you need.)\n\nI don't want this to sound like the end-all be-all. One of my absolute favorites is James Brown, and there is no way that some of his songs would hold up to the level of scrutiny I'm describing. And those records *kill*. It's all vibe. It's vibe all the way down, bebe. Not a chord change in sight. Barely a melody in some cases. And that's alright.\n\nSo what did James do? More often than not James would get all of his band (real jazz killers) in the studio and he would sing the parts to them one by one and allow them to input their own feel.\n\nHe'd start with the drummer and have them play a pattern that James was feeling. Once the drummer was jamming on that he would move on to the bass player and sing them an idea. Once the bass player had that germ of an idea they would continue to jam on it with the drummer, refining and adding their own thing. Then James would move on to the horns, and so on, and so on.\n\nWhile James could be dictatorial and (from the perspective of music education) the least technically qualified person in the room he had *vision*. \n\nIf the song has a strong identity you can give your players a good (non-technical) prompt and they can interpret that through their own sensibilities. You can describe a mood, or a scene, or an abstract sensation.\n\nR. Kelly once said (I'm paraphrasing): \"RnB is supposed to feel like the best moment of your *life*.\" That simple description conveys so much about the feel, the pleasure, and the joy that he is looking for in his music. It also excludes a lot of possibilities as well. If you can give your players a prompt like *that* then you can get everyone aligned on the same wavelength and it will carry you so much further without the need to dictate parts.\n\n----",

Or how to communicate and prevent really good players from over powering a song and doing too much? For this project I chose to leave a lot of room for the players to play and write their own parts, but I also needed to reel them in a little bit and simplify what was happening. Even then when I dug through the tracks I had to mute certain fills, take a simpler pass of the keys to let the bass do it\u2019s thing or vice versa. This also makes me consider the question: when do you let a song suggest to you when something special needs to happen?",

And does it really matter to care about things like that if it costs so much more to get a real 47, if it does then at what point does it start becoming a worthwhile investment other than for a self satisfaction? \n\nI\u2019m in the camp of just buy a sub 1k mic/guitars that does its thing. 1 - because it would be a ridiculous decision to spend more money than that with what I make now 2 - It\u2019s case by cases but a lot of times when I hear comparison it\u2019s not really a matter of \u201cit\u2019s better\u201d but more so it\u2019s exactly that thing or that sound we know and like.

This is their first production gig (which is fine), but we're wasting a lot of time on ideas that get scrapped later on. This person has a good ear, and occasionally has GREAT ideas, but it takes forever for them to let go of bad ideas. \n\nIt takes all of my patience to very slowly walk them through why the ideas aren't working, and there's a lot of pushback when I do. A lot of \"but can we just try it? I really feel like it will work\" then 3 hours later \"oh yeah I think you were right let's delete it\".",

The part is kind of loose and not always locked-in with the bass and guitar, so maybe they overdubbed a harmonica at double speed, so that it would play back an octave lower. That would also explain the heavy chorusing effect on the pitch, which might be the pitch fluctuation in the reeds being exaggerated.",

I was listening to an episode on Sonic Scoop about Nigel Godrich\u2019s approach to mixing and it was really eye opening to hear how bold his mixes are. I used to get distracted when something was panned but not balanced but after just forcing myself to do it I\u2019ve gotten more comfortable, and even fallen a bit in love with what panning can do. I\u2019ve noticed I have a tendency to pan instruments a certain way, pianos sound better panned, electric guitars always feel better panned right, no reason why it just does. Find what feels good to you! I haven\u2019t gotten bold enough to pan bass and drums to a side. One day",

I heard a very subtle low and thump after two particular downbeat and we could not figure out what it was. We solo'ed some groups and then I remembered that he had replicated my autotune settings on the bass guitar (he had a slightly different version). I know from lots of tuning experience that different modes will occasionally cause different types of artifacts. So we solo'ed the bass, switched from \"modern\" (his default) to \"classic\" and it was solved.",
