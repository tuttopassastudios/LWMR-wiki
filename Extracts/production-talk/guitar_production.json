    "content": "This made me think of a production technique Ive stumbled on.  We all have our go to instincts that can lead to a similar feeling across a  record.  Generally there is a dominant instrument that the song was written on such as guitar or piano maybe a synth.  Take a filled out productions and mute all the main ingredients and leave the additive colors, only the sprinkles on top. And start rebuilding the production around that. It can take you to an entirely different  universe and provide contrast in the arch of the record",

I heard a great story of someone telling (I want to say) Richard Marx that he hadn\u2019t released his record yet cause he\u2019s a perfectionist and RM replied \u201cBullshit. Name one thing you\u2019ve ever done that\u2019s actually perfect. You\u2019re just scared to move on.\u201d  That story has stuck with me.\n\n2) I\u2019m a fairly decent guitar player, have made an actual career of being paid to do it. And I STILL am either constantly hiring people better than I or recording things note by note and then assembled in protools afterwards. Dr Luke might be the best guitarist I\u2019ve ever been around (and I\u2019ve hung with Blake Mills, Tim Pierce, Phil X), and he CONSTANTLY would just hit record, play the four chords of the song free time, and then cut them up and drop them on the ones or wherever they\u2019re supposed to go in the song. My favorite thing about making records vs performing them live is that on record NO ONE CARES how you got there, just that you did. Unless your groove has something particularly magic to offer I\u2019d get over the one take mentality pretty quick.",

Hint: it\u2019s very rarely strictly the sonics and/or mix. That Olivia Rodrigo album sounded objectively terrible, but FELT awesome. And that\u2019s what mattered in the end.  Benny Blanco became successful with a folder full of songs at 120 bpm cause he didn\u2019t know how to change the tempo, and stacks of kick drums because he didn\u2019t know how to eq (he just layers a brighter kick on top if it needs more snap). When I\u2019d ask him why he pretty much did anything it was always \u201cI dunno, man, it just sounds cool!\u201d. Make sure you\u2019re attacking the work with that kind of mindset. \n\nWhen I get lost in the minutiae I try to zoom out and just be like \u201cdoes this whole track feel good? Am I instinctually bobbing my head?\u201d And if not, why?\n\n95% of the songs that people have sent me here, the issue hasn\u2019t been their space, or their monitoring, or whether they used a 60s or 70s guitar, or if they mixed analog or in the box. The issues almost always tend to be much less narrow in scope. Make sure you zoom out and just go \u201cis this cool?\u201d",

Together they create a single melodic voice.\n\n**2) **How do the instruments stack on each other? Do they clash? Cellos doubling a bass an octave up extend it's timbre into a higher register to make it read better. It's not so different from adding fuzz to an 808 so that it has more presence.\n\n**3) **Which instrument will cut through the music?\n\n---\n\nA few concepts that I'll add:\n\n**4) **Instruments in the foreground vs. the background. Know which part is the lead (focal point) at any given point in the record and then pare down the presence of the rest and push it into the back of the sound stage.\n\n**5)** (Piggybacking off of Felix's excellent post) What is the simplest way to achieve the desired effect? Reduce. Reduce. Reduce.\n\nCut instruments and parts ruthlessly and approach it with a minimalist's eye. Like writing a haiku: How few elements can you use to create an impression? Maybe a guitar part is carrying 90% of the groove and the drums only need to be a kick and a snare. Or maybe the guitar is covering the backbeat too, and you don't even need a snare!\n\nConstantly ask yourself \"What is the most important sensation in the record?\" and then focus it by cutting out everything that gets in the way.\n\n**6)** Hocketing. Pass the melody off between different instruments at different points in the song. Play it in different registers. Combine voices occasionally for special effect.\n\n**7)** Tonal contrast. Dark instruments plus bright instruments. Distorted and clean together. Near vs. distant.\n\nElements that sound same-y will gel together and elements that contrast tonally will pop.",

Maybe something really trashy and blown-out like Devil-Loc or Vulf Compressor. Something that really messes with the proportions of a sample.\n8. Easy and flexible integration of feedback loops.\n9. Intuitive integration of polyrhythmic looping or sequencing.\n10. A feature for easy implementation of Steve Reich 'It's Gonna Rain' style tape loop phasing.\n11.

You need to line up your edits so the wave form is perfect in the middle of each note, then use an equal gain cross fade at the edit point. This gives you the most transparency because there is no algorithmic stretching happening. \n\nIt limits very slightly your options with timing because bass wave forms are long, so lining them up perfectly means you can only move the timing the length of each waveform. It's also time consuming compared to stretching.\n\nIf you are editing a DI that is then going through significant processing (amp sims and shit), you can sometimes get away with one of the stretching algorithms. Elastic audio is ok and usable sometimes, but I prefer Ableton's complex mode over everything else I've heard.\n\nI try to avoid time stretching artifacts on lead vocals and bass instruments more than anything else (unless it's creatively interesting of course).",

Vibe is singer-songwriter, soul, RnB.\n\nWe tracked drums, bass, and keys live in the studio OD'd to scratch tracks we cooked up together. The scratch tracks / demos were just guitar vocal and we were really relying on the players to fill out the arrangements, but we knew more would be added down the line.\n\nAll the players were incredible. Could singe your eyebrows off with technical prowess and shredtastic chops. Tracks turned out great, still working on the arrangement, but..\n\nThis project has got me thinking more about the importance of how you present a song to session musicians and the 'space' you ask them to fill in a production. As well as the changing dynamics project to project affected by a revolving cast of participants, more fleshed out demos, etc... I find this a really interesting topic. Curious if anyone in the group has any unique experiences or insights whether as a producer or a musician.\n\nI've found that the more I flesh out demos with the artist beforehand the more bound and limited the session players we bring in are based off our decisions. This can make ODs more efficient, add a clearer direction, but can also remove the opportunity for the player to really add something special. Sometimes I don't want to be too suggestive b/c I want the players to have more of a blank canvas to work with.",

    "content": "Good question! \n\nAs @cian riordan said, when you're perfectly lining up the waveform of any solid tone, you want equal gain so it doesn't give you a boost on the crossfade. This is for \"correlated\" signals where the waveform is lining up exactly. A bass guitar, the middle of a vocal note, a synth with a consistent waveform, etc.\n\nWhen you're doing a crossfade on noise (breaths, sss's, ambience between drum hits, etc), you want equal power because these \"uncorrelated\" signals need a bit of boost around the crossfade for the perceived loudness to be the same.\n\nYou can check this by using a synth note or long vocal note, doing an edit to make it longer or shorter, lining up the waveforms perfectly, and doing a cross fade. You will find that equal power causes a volume bump. Equal gain will be smooth.\n\nDo the same thing with white noise and this time equal power will be smooth, while equal gain will cause a volume dip.",

You can get a Warm 47 for a grand or real 47 for 15 grand and they\u2019re preeeetttyy  close. But the devil is in the details. The original Dare you to Move (I think that song has had 4 different versions now) is pretty close to the Fields version\u2026 Fields rocked up the drums a little more, and by far most importantly  had my sage input (and gear) for a more kickass guitar sound. The song went from a heavily pushed song that couldn\u2019t quite get its footing for them to a massive multi platinum career defining hit. It can be frustrating to watch someone else turn something we got 95% of the way there into the thing that got released, but often times it\u2019s that exact skill which makes them worth the investment from the label. Understanding that difference and learning how to bridge the gap is the whole secret to making a living in this business.",

If you are trying to converge on final guitar takes while your client is wanting to diverge and explore new creative ideas, then might be worth explicitly communicating 'this is where we're at and here's what we need to get done today' as lead producer before you begin tracking just so everyone knows. I'd be wary of stifling the exploration / play of your client, but maybe you could have them channel that into a notebook or voice memo in the back of the studio and you could schedule a time with the sole purpose of fucking around and exploring / playing with new ideas. Really just wanna make sure everyone knows when you're in 'convergence mode' and when you're in 'divergence mode' to avoid that frustration.",

That also led to cool \u201cchoices\u201d that came from like, having my violist play a part I made the demo of on a semi-modular mono synth. Ensemble can be a unifying lens to capture your diverse ideas through and give them a sense of unity",

    "content": "Sooo, on the recording side of things: if you\u2019re going DI, most interfaces do not have a high enough input impedance to do passive pickups justice, especially if you want a decent amount of low end. Guitar pickups sound good with 1-2MOhm(the input impedance of a good tube amp), but if I want really clear modern low end that can compete with 808s, then I\u2019ve had the best results with around 10MOhm on passive bass pickups. Another important thing is a transistor-based active DI will not get you a full low end. You will end up re-amping or using amp emulations etc. Octal tubes(the type of tubes IN the B15) will. Octal tubes have a lot more body(think U47, for example) and will get you there much much quicker. I have a Sarno V8, which isn\u2019t perfect, but sounds clean, \u201cfinished\u201d and modern from the get-go. No compression or emulations needed. It\u2019s also comparatively affordable, so totally worth every penny.",

    "content": "I think the best thing you can do when learning a synthesizer is to pick just one or two and really take the time to learn them inside and out. There's so much overlap between the feature set and if you can get very intuitive with one synth you'll go so much farther.\n\nBack in the day I bought NI's *Komplete* bundle and it was just way too many new instruments too fast. Too many options. I never got to know any of them very well. Most synths have all of the same features that you'll want, but there's still a learning curve for every single one that you have to get over before you can be really expressive. I wish it were as easy as picking up a guitar or a horn where everything is standardized and lies in the same place. But that's part of what makes synths great: Their plasticity.\n\nNowadays the only synths I reach for (unless I need a very specific sound) are *Massive X*, *Razor*, and my Moog Sub 37. The first two are very different and don't share many features. I use the Moog when I don't want to be tethered to my computer. Limiting my available tools has been a net benefit for me.",

And that\u2019s because time was only taught to the picking hand. Being able to internalize it through the whole body is my current goal. Bending legs or moving the whole body as opposed to just tapping one foot or moving my head back and forth. This may be a weird territory, but I feel the time from all the way down the navel when I feel locked in. But all of that can also collapse immediately once I start thinking about it. So visualizing clicks as my navel lighting up is something I am adding to my practice these days. \n\nI don\u2019t really play drum sets but I\u2019ll do a paradiddle every now and then to teach myself how to coordinate the timing between two arms",

But the self doubt was brought on because I didn\u2019t spend enough time practicing my instrument and maintaining a healthy relationship with my fingers and the guitar. I\u2019m still with a tons of self doubt but I am learning that as long as I\u2019m working on the right things, practice won\u2019t betray me. What I put in comes back out, and I had a weird relationship with that for a long time because I would work on a lot of wrong things and spend a long time doing that.",

Found this dude power sagging different fuzzes - the Octa Hive pedal around 12:15 could be kind of close to the tone from that Blake Mills / Pino ref.

I've had guitars recorded loosely toa click and worked the groove around that - lining up the downbeats of the drums/bass  with the guitars even if it's a bit early or late. that was for a more indie type of joint. and for something more trap /modern hip hop, I've nudged bass notes or samples to get them to either sync w drums up for impact  or nudge slightly off to hype of of pull back the energy in the groove. \n\nas far as programming. I'll play with forward swing and dragging notes a lot if I'm going for a more real/dynamic feel when programming. keeping in mind that if the goal is trying to stay \"on time\" any fwd swing that might happen at the start of a phrase will be compensated with some drag  after or vice versa.  keeping velocities in mind w drum hits + linking it to a filter env so that harder hits have more high end and softer hits end up a bit rounder.\n\nadding subtle layers that are similar   to the main drums but occupy a different texture or tone  in dif  sections to thicken up the groove or automate the attack /sustain of certain elements thru diff sections to help shift the listener  focus throughout",

I started to using a DAW in my 14s (FL Studio, yeah I know xD) and in the last 3 years I've been using Logic Pro and last months Pro Tools (just for editing and mixing).\n\nI love to produce electronic pop with a mix between synths and acoustic instruments. I want to be more versatile and confortable producing other genres (genres that I can produce just in my bedroom studio without having a great recording gear). \n\nI'm feeling stuck, I'm trying to listen different genres. I'm feeling very limited because I don't have a great background as a music player or student (my bsc is physics engineering). The music industry is tough and I want to be more confortable to work in other genres.\n\nI tried to be as brief as possible. What advice do you have for this situation?

Seems like we tend to be extra conscious of the way our words are perceived with singers, and not just because of diva personalities or fragile egos.",

    "content": "As a dude who's musical education was mostly in accapella music and who's production has mostly been midi that was easily quantizable, my sense of rhythm is nowhere near tight enough for the tier of work that I've been entering into lately. This means if I play something, I'm going to need to be quantizing audio and I'm relying on the visual aid of the waveform because my inherent sense of groove is pretty weak. So I'm looking for advice on quick heuristics for quantizing audio. \n\nTodays example: I played some palm muted acoustic guitars, I've marked the scrape of the pick in red and the peak of the waveform where the note truly starts ringing in green. The waveform actually starts a little before the scrape as you can see where the pick touches the string wave over on the left . How are y'all thinking about which part of this waveform should fall on which side of the beat?",

It can feel better to be early in certain styles but it can feel better to be late on other styles. it also depends on who else is doing what\n\nBut groove template is always there if you wanna line it up with other instruments. bounce and make the source and destination audio files the same length, make sure the markers are in the correct place then sync them up. \n\nI\u2019m 90% manual editing though. Because aligning automatically can fix notes I didn\u2019t want to fix. you can also go measure by measure to be more careful if you want to auto align with groove templates \n\nyou want to ask yourself \u201cis this note late or early?\u201d before making any moves. I like nudging with keyboard so I can fine tune how far it goes. \n\nNowadays I\u2019m more committed to \u201cthe only way to make the groove feel good is to play it that way\u201d. I hate having to edit and to be honest, nothing beats well played rhythm section\u2026 Especially because I do a lot of in between the groove stuff, 30% quantization can mess with the feel of well landed notes.

I believe there\u2019s a difference between wanting to be better and working towards it vs not being able to move on out of fear and holding onto something without knowing the next move. If that was the case I wouldn\u2019t have sent what I first recorded to the artist.

Is it a workflow preference or the aesthetic of edit/sampling? I can only imagine it being faster playing the parts in rather than stitching bits together. \n\n\n\nThe whole goal is to be able to consistently reproduce that magical groove, and being able to create great moments when I am with other people. I really believe I have a good sense of groove but can\u2019t execute it just yet. \n\nI can see myself spending countless hours editing myself. (Which I already do daily). That time is better spent working on my chops. If I can hire other musicians so I can stop wasting time trying multiple takes, I would. But I don\u2019t have that just yet.

Leaves no strong impression, or the impression that the performance lacks intention.\n\nBand rocks (his guitar included), Harmonies and Gang Vocals are cool. \nReally the lead vocal is the only thing in the way of getting the song to be really good. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel like his intuition for the release date (deadline is in 4 days) is good and could be very valuable for us.\nOn the other, I don't see why anyone would be truly excited for us if singer is mid.\n(I know he's good deep down, he's given me chills when singing with no pressure, rn we're just lacking some of that magic.)\n\nAs the song is today, you wouldn't love to listen to the song on your way to work or school, enjoying it for what it is.\n\nAnyway, right now I'm going to try and squeeze that magic out of him in the next following days when we can see each other.\nAs I'm typing this I also realize I should send him the instrumental and let him try shit alone. \n\nMaybe that's my answer.",

But I think we can dig a bit deeper.\n\nI like to work in a way during tracking/production that\u2019s maybe a bit more old school with shooting for around -18dbFS on the average. It gives me a kind of fixed reference in my mind which gives me enough headroom for most dynamics. Now the important part is you have to turn up your monitoring/headphones volume to be adequately loud to work with those lower levels and then leave it there.That being said it might be necessary to bring down other pre existing tracks that are too loud.\n\nNow since the volume of the monitoring/headphones stays the same during that tracking session you can use the gain of your preamp (or the output gain of the compressor, if you\u2019re using one on the way in) to adjust the vocal or instrument so that for every part of the arrangement it feels right. So in a sense you are pre mixing during the recording, taking off some work down the line",

The part is kind of loose and not always locked-in with the bass and guitar, so maybe they overdubbed a harmonica at double speed, so that it would play back an octave lower. That would also explain the heavy chorusing effect on the pitch, which might be the pitch fluctuation in the reeds being exaggerated.",

I was listening to an episode on Sonic Scoop about Nigel Godrich\u2019s approach to mixing and it was really eye opening to hear how bold his mixes are. I used to get distracted when something was panned but not balanced but after just forcing myself to do it I\u2019ve gotten more comfortable, and even fallen a bit in love with what panning can do. I\u2019ve noticed I have a tendency to pan instruments a certain way, pianos sound better panned, electric guitars always feel better panned right, no reason why it just does. Find what feels good to you! I haven\u2019t gotten bold enough to pan bass and drums to a side. One day",

Noah's comment unlocked something, I hadn't done before, moving the melody thru different layers. The main melodic guitar. I had it at like 60% where I normally leave it. But had it widen to over 80% in chorus. Then more narrow than I would normally have a doubled melodic at like 35%. Usually id just do one guitar, mono to scratch the scene change itch. I save hard panned left right area for chorus guitars or stereo stereo synths to swim in. That with dropping the piano for first half of verse 2 did the trick! Still hoping this is a catalyst for more sharing of ideas",

This can sometimes be legitimized by having the part played by another sound or by recording the sound differently, in my opinion. Or sometimes the part it just superfluous per se.",

We solo'ed some groups and then I remembered that he had replicated my autotune settings on the bass guitar (he had a slightly different version). I know from lots of tuning experience that different modes will occasionally cause different types of artifacts. So we solo'ed the bass, switched from \"modern\" (his default) to \"classic\" and it was solved.",
