Generally there is a dominant instrument that the song was written on such as guitar or piano maybe a synth.  Take a filled out productions and mute all the main ingredients and leave the additive colors, only the sprinkles on top. And start rebuilding the production around that. It can take you to an entirely different  universe and provide contrast in the arch of the record",

I\u2019m talking actually nudging things around, not stretching. Then I\u2019ll consolidate and drop into Melodyne. In Melodyne I\u2019ll turn the whole thing and also really pay attention to the timing. At this stage it\u2019s a lot more stretching and/or compressing notes, or more importantly PARTS of words. Like I\u2019ll separate the consonant, and time compress that and bring up the volume so ccchhhhhhhhair becomes CHaaaaiiirrrr. (If that makes any sense). Then back into ProTools. Double check for any weirdness, comp back in the untuned bits you can get away with if you want. Then I\u2019ll do a final cleaning up of group Esses, do my little what I call Swedish time stretching technique, REALLY pocket and polish the vocals.

Audible signal at approx. -36 dBFS was present during playback.\n\nFurthermore, each instance of Melodyne did not detect the audio identically. The plugin version detected Tone #1 at +48 ct, while ARA and Standalone detected it at + 50 ct. No difference was noted in the detected pitch center of Tone #2 between the three instances.\n\n**DISCUSSION**\n\nTesting showed Beckley, et al. (2023) to be correct in asserting that Melodyne does not behave identically between its plugin, ARA and standalone versions. Differences do not appear limited to the tuning algorithm, but indeed the detection algorithm as well. The relative subjective quality of tuning results between these versions cannot, however, be determined by the present test. Further testing and qualitative evaluation may be needed to add to the literature and determine the most preferable version of Melodyne to use for tuning purposes.",

    "content": "<deep breath>\nSo, grasshopper, everything matters, and nothing matters. It depends on where you are and where you\u2019re going, and most importantly actually knowing where you\u2019re going.\n\nI view the difference in shitty gear vs good gear as compound interest. A vintech one on one might sound basically like a vintage neve. ALMOST indistinguishable. But if you\u2019re using it on all 149 of the tracks you\u2019re compiling into a pop song, the end result is going to be 149 times more noticeable. The second floor of the leaning tower of Pisa looks pretty spot on but the people on the 15th floor are freaking out. \n\nThat said, I could record a garbage singer through my 251 and my chain, and if I didn\u2019t know what to do with it, it would still be garbage. The flip side is we actually demoed different mics and different chains on Paris Hilton. There was a right answer. And she\u2019s not gonna win any singing contests, but at the end of the day the cumulative effect of all the decisions we made led to tracks that are still being played in clubs to make people dance over a decade later.\n\nDetails matter in not just what the audience hears eventually, but what the artist hears initially, giving them the confidence and headspace to sprinkle in their extra few (sometime more than a few) percentage points of vibe that the audience attaches too later. Fix it in the mix is an abused concept because it doesn\u2019t take in to account the affect of shitty sound or feel on the performance. You think 1 mic doesn\u2019t matter? I\u2019ve heard people sing noticeably more in tune and in time when switching from DAW monitoring to direct monitoring. It ALL matters.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t understand songs, melody, rhythm, and how these things interact to move people? None of it matters.",

He could write every single note of a big band chart if he wanted to, but he (with a few early exceptions) never did this.\n\nHis recipe for music making was this: \n\nA) Start with a great song (chords and melody)\nB) Curate a team of players with their own strong musical identities \nC) Bring them together and let them interpret the song\nD) Direct them on feel and how to listen to and respond to each other\n\nThat's it. Miles' music was never about big arranging moments, or written-out parts. He started with great raw material, great players, and great prompting and then he let them roam free and play.\n\nSo that's one more way to approach it. \n\nThere are two things that I keep coming back to in all of this: A great song and a vision.

Together they create a single melodic voice.\n\n**2) **How do the instruments stack on each other? Do they clash? Cellos doubling a bass an octave up extend it's timbre into a higher register to make it read better. It's not so different from adding fuzz to an 808 so that it has more presence.\n\n**3) **Which instrument will cut through the music?\n\n---\n\nA few concepts that I'll add:\n\n**4) **Instruments in the foreground vs. the background. Know which part is the lead (focal point) at any given point in the record and then pare down the presence of the rest and push it into the back of the sound stage.\n\n**5)** (Piggybacking off of Felix's excellent post) What is the simplest way to achieve the desired effect? Reduce. Reduce. Reduce.\n\nCut instruments and parts ruthlessly and approach it with a minimalist's eye. Like writing a haiku: How few elements can you use to create an impression? Maybe a guitar part is carrying 90% of the groove and the drums only need to be a kick and a snare. Or maybe the guitar is covering the backbeat too, and you don't even need a snare!\n\nConstantly ask yourself \"What is the most important sensation in the record?\" and then focus it by cutting out everything that gets in the way.\n\n**6)** Hocketing. Pass the melody off between different instruments at different points in the song. Play it in different registers. Combine voices occasionally for special effect.\n\n**7)** Tonal contrast. Dark instruments plus bright instruments. Distorted and clean together. Near vs. distant.\n\nElements that sound same-y will gel together and elements that contrast tonally will pop.",

I often detune L/R doubles of a lead by a few 10ths of a cycle (like take the left channel to 439.4hz and the right channel to 440.6hz in auto tune) to help separate them.\n\nThis is actually what a \"chorus\" effect is meant to do. When you actually get a bunch of great singers together to sing the same thing, their different timbres and slightly different pitches will add up to a very rich sound you can't get from stacking one tuned voice. That's what the effect called \"chorus\" is essentially trying to mimic with slight detune and delay.\n\nNot sure if this is a topic we've covered much but I know @BatMeckley and @Slow Hand have thoughts",

Pianos have big glisses, horns can squeal, bowed strings can sweep a fast legato scale up into the downbeat or do a large gliss.\n\nThen there's foley.

But, if you took one home and used it as your one pre across 100 tracks of your masterpiece, even your parents are going to hear the difference between it and a vintage neve. That small 5% difference really added up at the end. I\u2019m sure after floor two of the leaning tower of Pisa the engineers we\u2019re like \u201clookin good boss! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc \u201c and it wasn\u2019t til they compounded their error that people started to panic.\nIf you\u2019re making tracks 95% in the box with samples and soft synths and then just drop a featured rapper on top of it, it\u2019s probably not going to matter if you use a Scarlett or an Apollo or an Apogee. But if you\u2019re a professional mixer constantly printing stuff 100x a session through outboard gear you\u2019re going to notice a difference I can guarantee you. Or if you\u2019re doing a Low record where there\u2019s only three elements and one of them is the most gifted voice of a generation, the gear is going to matter a lot more than if you\u2019re squeezing a TikTok star into 37 plugins and then into a 150 track mix.\n\nSo at the end of the day, much like producing, songwriting or pretty much everything else in life, it\u2019s that old prayer of strength to change the things you can, the grace to accept the things you can\u2019t, and the most important bit that everyone seems to skip over, THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. \n\nDo what works for you, and clearly, I sweat the details enough to notice that the algorithms are different, or Cians dangerous was down a half a db on one side, but also, when to actually use that information to actually make the actual point.

    "content": "Wanted to share some thoughts spurred on by a recent experience on here. So a local artist has hired me to produce two of her songs. Vibe is singer-songwriter, soul, RnB.\n\nWe tracked drums, bass, and keys live in the studio OD'd to scratch tracks we cooked up together. The scratch tracks / demos were just guitar vocal and we were really relying on the players to fill out the arrangements, but we knew more would be added down the line.\n\nAll the players were incredible. Could singe your eyebrows off with technical prowess and shredtastic chops. Tracks turned out great, still working on the arrangement, but..\n\nThis project has got me thinking more about the importance of how you present a song to session musicians and the 'space' you ask them to fill in a production. As well as the changing dynamics project to project affected by a revolving cast of participants, more fleshed out demos, etc... I find this a really interesting topic. Curious if anyone in the group has any unique experiences or insights whether as a producer or a musician.\n\nI've found that the more I flesh out demos with the artist beforehand the more bound and limited the session players we bring in are based off our decisions. This can make ODs more efficient, add a clearer direction, but can also remove the opportunity for the player to really add something special. Sometimes I don't want to be too suggestive b/c I want the players to have more of a blank canvas to work with.",

    "content": "Okay @Nomograph Mastering , so I think the analogy is a little off. Music is a conversation, but it's a conversation between performers. At it's best, the performance is authentic, transcendent, and speaks to our souls in a way that real-world conversation with words can't do. But it's heightened, exaggerated, hyper-focused. If the song is written ahead of time, it's more akin to actors interpreting a script. The words are written, the notes are there. Unless we're talking about jazz improvisation, which is the closest we come to real world conversation, but even then, it's translated and performed. As much as Miles was saying what he wanted to say, he was saying it that way so that an audience would hear it, it wasn't a private conversation.\n\nNow, if you get incredible actors on a stage or in front of a camera, you can let them do their thing with minimal trickery, minimal edits, and it will move you to tears. The respond to each other and elevate the piece beyond what feels possible. Watch that same play as a community theater-level performance and feel nothing. The reality is that a lot of the artists that are coming through aren't Sidney Poitier. They're just not that good at making their music feel effortless. Not every play works as a film, and vice versa. Not every track benefits from having a band in a room. \n\nConfusing the genesis of songwriting (one person crafting both sides of a conversation) with the act of expressing that work (one person performing every part, a la Tom Hanks' motion capture of every character in The Polar Express). I know that ultimately you and I agree on the benefits of humans recording together, but the analogy feels too blurry to me.",

Sean should charge for that plugin because it's so good.\n\nIt's a delay plugin that specializes in super-long and evolving echoes with lots of modulation. Sean has described the different algorithms as \"too exotic\" for his other plugins so he bundled them all together as *Supermassive*.\n\nIt certainly excels in that role, and also doubles as a good lush reverb when you turn up the diffusion knob.\n\nFunnily, I almost never use it for long echoes. As it turns out, it's really good at creating super-tight and roomy sounds. Just dial the delay time to < 15 ms and turn up the feedback and suddenly you have a very lush and chorus-y \"room\" sound.

(2023) reported differences in tuning results between the plugin and standalone versions of Melodyne. This investigator undertook a test of Melodyne plugin, ARA and standalone versions to determine whether the resulting tuned audio would null.\n\n**METHODS**\n\nAll testing was performed at a sample rate of 48kHz and with .wav files at a bit depth of 32 bits. Tuning was tested using two 2-second square wave tones generated with FabFilter One in Logic Pro X. Tone #1 was generated at a constant pitch of C4 +50ct. Tone #2 was generated at a pitch of C4 with the following settings: Modulation Generator (MG) Frequency set to 4.033 Hz,  MG waveform set to value 0.500, and Frequency Modulation MG set to value 0.123. Each tone was printed on a separate channel as a Bounce-in-place (bip). The two bips were then joined into a single, 6-second, mono .wav file with 2 seconds of silence between the bips. The 6-second .wav file was copied onto two new channels in Logic Pro X, and dragged out of Logic Pro onto the desktop for use in Melodyne standalone.\n\nAudio was transferred into Melodyne: one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne non-ARA, one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne ARA, and the copy of the .wav file on the desktop was loaded into Melodyne standalone. All transfers were completed using the Melodic (Standard) algorithm. \n\nTransferred audio was quantized to pitch C4, offset 0 ct, Pitch Modulation 0.0%, Pitch Drift 0.0%. All other settings were left at defaults; Note Assignment mode was checked to verify that Playback Type in each case was 'Tonal'. \n\nResulting audio was printed and imported into three new mono channels in Logic Pro X. Null testing was performed using the phase invert feature in Logic Pro X's stock 'Gain' plugin.",

The first thing is: the correction is only as good as the detection\u2026 so it\u2019s worth a quick run through to make sure it\u2019s mapped the vocal take properly.  Sometimes it gets a syllable or two in the wrong octave, and rarer times it\u2019ll get it wrong a fourth or fifth off. I\u2019m not sure the process for correcting that in the plug in off the top of my head.

You want to separate the meat of the note out, and concentrate on tuning that. Also remember that the \u201cblob\u201d is just an average of the tuning info in it, meaning if your note slides from C to E, melodyne will correct that blob to D. (I hope that makes sense.)",

It\u2019s part of what makes this place so special, the heavy hitters that share all the secrets. Tony has a long long history of hosting the entire LA music scene at his house for breakfast and hangs about music, from high school bands like Kara\u2019s Flowers (now maroon5), phantom planet, Simon Dawes, phoebe bridgers, Switchfoot, an unknown aspiring Canadian engineer Shawn Everett, to established acts, he\u2019s been legendary for his generosity with his time and his knowledge. I don\u2019t always agree with him musically, but I respect the hell out of him, and the music community as a whole is far better off for his contributions to it. \n\nI don\u2019t think the fact that he chose not to divulge what most likely is someone else\u2019s secret sauce that helps them make their signature sound is worth dragging him on the internet for.",

You have to know your artists. Often, id even argue more often than not, it\u2019s the fuckery and the messing around that often inspires the best ideas. We tend to be very bad at being creative with a gun to our head. As a producer, I\u2019m trying to foster that safety and relaxation, while taking a Birds Eye view of the conversation listening for anything that I can go \u201cwait! THAT was a lyric\u201d or a riff or whatever. That\u2019s always worked much better than me staring at someone going \u201chush. Write.\u201d\n\nOccasionally, like the old Peter Gabriel SO story, you have to lock the artist in the room and tell them they can\u2019t come out until they\u2019re done.

    "content": "I've been melodyning vocals for a ten song album past couple weeks and feel like I've leveled up my chops significantly. I'm no Beckley, but browsing whats been previously shared here and trial and error has been the mechanism of growth for me.\n\nI kinda had the note separation tool workflow down from work in other programs. I've been experimenting with the time tool and attack speed tool as well as formant shifting to mask when the tuning becomes more audible than I'd like. That's probably where I'd pinpoint the level up for me personally. That and trying to be more conscious about not relying too much on the graphical UI. Unless it's something that really calls for hard tuning I lean towards wanting it to feel invisible / natural. Im realizing more what parts of the note actually need to be more 'on' and which can be more 'off' or just left alone. That and letting notes naturally drift to become more sharp as they tail off. If I'm too heavy handed it starts to feel lifeless to me. I'm also appreciating more the nuance of how one might approach different genres or styles with melodyne. Its humbling how powerful the program really is.\n\nThere've been a few moments with the attack speed tool that have felt like magic curing some subtleties of the performances that bug me, but I don't feel super confident that I have a grasp on that one yet. I've been working in standalone and importing a REF mix. For some reason I feel more confident dealing with esses in protools with RX or clip gain than I do melodyne idk why. Some frustrations have been flipping back and forth between tracks when tuning multiple files feels real clunky. I might be missing something about how best to do that. I wish, like with RX monitor, you could hear the vocal through your mix chain when tuning (is that possible?). Being able to rename exported files would be nice too like in RX.",

I think it comes down to 2 things for me. \n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n\n1) Choosing Sounds. \n\nIn addition to vibe & genre & emotional intent, each instrument or sample that you pick covers a certain area of the overall picture. Knowing where that part is going to go in the overall arrangement changes how much hi end or low end or wetness (etc.) you want. It also steers performances. \n\n2) Actually Mixing As You Go \n\nOnce a part is recorded, do a quick adjustment so that you hear closer to a finished product. This helps you make better choices about what else needs to be added, (or not added,) and will likely inspire the next step.",

And try to follow it up with an idea that you think works.  In my case I  said \u201c we all love the foundation and we landed somewhere and that feels good. Now we have to be disciplined and be sure that anything we add is truly adding and not taking us away from our northern star.\u201d  And if you think they have bad ideas that they are glued to, ask questions, why do you feel this part has to be here, what is it doing for the song as a whole?

You want people to load this up and be inspired and interested in diving into what it can do. Most people can't get away with the ear-splitting default patch from Omnisphere, and why would you want to anyway?",

But even when still in the production grind I like having guitars laying around so I can grab one when I take a break or bring on in the house with me. If you have the flexibility, w/o compromising deadlines, I've found it helpful to leave room to indulge the moments when songs / melodies / lyrics pop into my head even when my expectation that day was to work on a mix or other production.

I think a lot of what Taylor Skye is doing is taking sounds and then warping them/distorting them to shit using all of the \"wrong\" methods, and then just judging what comes out and deciding if it should be kept. I think there's a good hint of this in the lead sound at the start, where it's really out of rhythm and grainy, some notes seem to sort of \"break\" which reminds me of the results you get when you try to formant shift a verbed-out or polyphonic sound with little alterboy, or even abusing izotope RX on something that doesn't really need it (also, the RX de-reverb can do wild things to a sound you've put reverb on higher in the chain). Logic, which is what he uses, also has a lesser known formant shift that you can only get to by turning on flex pitch then adjusting in the side info bar, which can really take sounds into space. I haven't done this with melodyne, but I imagine there are some similar features.",

The original Massive had a lot of aliasing that could make it sound hazy and flat. Switching over to Massive X it is crystal clear and even buzzy saw waves feel warm, pure, and tactile.\n\nIt has extremely flexible modulation capabilities that I find to be very musical as well as some very comprehensive ADSHR envelopes. It also has four different keyboard tracking curves that you can assign and tweak, which is very important when fine-tuning your patch to make sure that it sounds even across the entire range of keys.\n\nIt has a lot of musical sounding filters that can inject a ton of vibe, or be completely neutral. The *noise* section is robust and very flexible. I use it a lot.\n\nFinally, it has a great-sounding set of internal effects (delay, chorus, saturation, verb, etc) that can be placed anywhere inside of the routing diagram. It's always a bummer when the on-board effects aren't very inspiring. But NI has a strong catalog of well-designed dsp to draw on and integrate into their products, so it's turned out great.\n\nOverall, it's a very robust and well-rounded synthesizer that also does a lot of things extremely well. It can be super clean (like Serum) but also get very dirty, which I appreciate in a synth.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that the preset browser kind of sucks. I prefer the original Massive's browser. NI is well aware and they have been overhauling it and slowly adding new features, so I trust in time this will be made better.",

And they\u2019ll obvs all be treated individually . Re : which 808s ? Ime I find the choice of 808 (in my genres ) is a trend thing , in the last 3-4 years its pretty much been a progression by producers through perhaps four or five 808 samples .....and when the sample changes its often in alignment with a new programming technique (like new multiple flams ....or conversely, sparse hits etc ) . If you\u2019re searching for ready made samples I could point you to a few places or if you\u2019d like a little pack of the ones I\u2019m referring to in what I said previously ....hmu. Happy to pass on privately . If so, these ones are more contemporary rnb hip hop than the actual  old Skool electro Roland 808 kick",

A lot of tech these days enables that ease and has opened the door to more people writing and producing their records.\n\nBut a secondary side-effect that I think we can all observe - and I think this is more to your point - is that musicians are leaning into those methods and not pursuing the hard work and practice that is necessary to do things like singing well, or playing piano with more than a base level of proficiency, or orchestrating an ensemble well. The expressive unlock of being highly proficient isn't being pursued like it was in the past decades (before we had so may technological means). People are - broadly speaking - more satisfied these days to settle for records that don't push into that potential.\n\nWhat we lose are the heights of expression that virtuosity unlocks. Whether that's singing like Aretha Franklin, or playing a simple ballad like Bill Evans, or writing a song with as much sophistication and lyrical wit as Joni Mitchell.",

By doing that they lost the heart of the song. The magic was in the umami effect lyrically and in performace of the vocal over the uke. The way her vocal would dance around feeling loose and unsure to striking and confident. \"Im confident im insecure.\" Is such a clever contradiction. There was nothing unsure or lacking in confidence in this final production or vocal performace. It was, we're as talented as anyone on earth, listen and watch!!

Well at least the part I find that people really want my taste to be involved for. At some point, you can get a session player to play a part if you really need it played a certain way but knowing when to use it, when/how to build to that part, and how to shape a sound is a different set of skills.",

Then we had them do harmonies for all the lines as well (at least the lines we knew we wanted harmonies) \n\nThey were great enough singers they just did a bunch of harmony takes and it was super fast and easy to layer and edit.

    "content": "If you're concerned about being too suggestive to the players about their parts then strip back the demo until it contains only the most essential parts. No fancy stuff. Just chords, melody, and lyric. *Maybe* a kick drum pattern. Lead sheet style.\n\nIf the song is good then it will still be compelling. The best songs tend to be very robust and can be played a dozen different ways because they are fundamentally compelling. If the demo doesn't feel good this way then the song may need more work.\n\nLesser songs will depend on the arrangement or production to be compelling, or only work in a narrow band of styles. Sometimes a song can only work one way. It's okay if this is the case for your song, but then it's up to you to present the demo with the arrangement or elements that are essential to make the song compelling, and that will close off more and more of the instrumental possibilities.\n\nSo if you want to increase the chances of a session player delivering an unexpected, brilliant, idea then set them up for success with a strong song that can be interpreted many ways.\n\n----",

And this is not disclosed at all by Celemony in the Melodyne documentation, unless you infer it from that bit in the manual I screenshotted yesterday.\n\nI think in general it's important to rigorously test our tools when we suspect or observe that they're not working as they should. The likes of GS and Vi-Control are full of people talking about issues but never actually testing them. We can do better here, especially when testing, like you did with Auto-Tune, leads to an opportunity to put queries and complaints to the manufacturers themselves.",

It's only a limitation if you let it be. (But I will echo @SoundsLikeJoe and @Ross Fortune , sometimes the only way is without a click. Whatever serves the song best)",

Been trying to give all their ideas a shot thinking they\u2019ll either work or it\u2019ll be obvious that it\u2019s not the one (which usually leads to a unanimous decision), but he\u2019s concluded that a lot of these ideas will work \u201conce more stuff is in the track.\u201d Curious how to steer us in (what I believe is) a more viable direction in a non domineering way.

And to your point about being patient, I think all we needed was a little more time to try stuff out and get on the same page. A good reminder not to sweat it too hard if I leave a session worried about the current state of the music. Putting it down for the evening and coming back with fresh ears does wonders. (Also should note that \"arrangement decisions\" was a massive oversimplification of the questions we were trying to answer lol).\n\nApologies if this turns into a novel, but would love to share some takeaways. I think the north star point you made is super important and well put. I think the artist I was working with got more comfortable trying new ideas the more he realized we were both aiming at the same thing (just approaching it differently). He's also only recorded / released one song before (and doesn't have much prior experience collaborating), so I totally understand the fear of things sounding different than he imagined. That's not a knock on the artist at all - I say that matter of factly and it's where everybody starts.\n\n@NoahNeedleman made an analogy about being a \"doctor vs a doula\" which I found super insightful. I think I was afraid that trying to be a \"doctor\" at all was somehow inherently an ego move or underestimating the artist's instincts. Ended up concluding that the project required a little bit of both, and that it's 100% okay and helpful to know where my experience could help us reach the artist's intention. I think interpreting the artist's intention is so much of the job, and if they don't yet have the tools or experience, that may push our job a little more to the doctoring side. There was definitely still some doulaing of course.",

Flex pitch tends to knock off a noticeable bit of high end to my ear. \n\nThat said though, I read this in a youtube comment so take this with a massive grain of salt (would love if anyone can confirm this), APPARENTLY Logic flex pitch / flex time are designed to work best with CAF file type instead of WAV and therefore sounds better if you have your default set to that. I'm sure most people won't want to use anything other than WAV but for whatever that may be worth.",

That will help you more than \"solving\" it one particular way",

Elements which if muted would leave you feeling like something is missing but you can\u2019t necessarily make them out when in. \n\nI guess this could be anything from a few percussion loops (maybe panned/verb with no pre-delay or less high end to place them at the back of the mix) to a subtle vocal or foley sample playing one note throughout the groove. \n\nLayering to me is part of this but my intent with it is usually to create a sound or get more out of an element (like layering the attack of a snap with a clap for a different transient / texture). But this doesn\u2019t always add to \u201cfullness\u201d in my mind. It just makes one element better or more interesting. \n\nMaybe start with the loops and foley.

What made me reconsider this definition was hearing a handful of reviews for the new Charli XCX album criticize the \"production\" on songs like this one:",

    "content": "Vocalign is really essential to my work flow because of how many harmonies i get from clients & collaborators. I also create doubles with it a lot & use melodyne/alterboy to enhance the texture. \n\nAs far as editing groove/timing, that\u2019s hard cause I always cut that stuff until it feels right. Most of the time I\u2019m gettin tracks where the artist or the producer or whoever (lots of times it\u2019s the same person) has already agonized over the timing and cut it up so it\u2019s solid. I\u2019m mindful of words where the first syllable is cacophony or plosive-based (k, t, d) when it comes to sounds that hit on the quarter note (esp with snares). I usually let those sounds start just before the transient and end so that vowel is starting right on the note, depending on how it\u2019s quantized if that makes sense. \n\nFeel like groove editing gets a weird wrap but i here songs where the timing could have used aligning after the amount of compression that got applied.",

    "content": "(Ok. Now I'm starting to run with this train of thought. Now would be a good time to step off if you've gotten what you need.)\n\nI don't want this to sound like the end-all be-all. One of my absolute favorites is James Brown, and there is no way that some of his songs would hold up to the level of scrutiny I'm describing. And those records *kill*. It's all vibe. It's vibe all the way down, bebe. Not a chord change in sight. Barely a melody in some cases. And that's alright.\n\nSo what did James do? More often than not James would get all of his band (real jazz killers) in the studio and he would sing the parts to them one by one and allow them to input their own feel.\n\nHe'd start with the drummer and have them play a pattern that James was feeling. Once the drummer was jamming on that he would move on to the bass player and sing them an idea. Once the bass player had that germ of an idea they would continue to jam on it with the drummer, refining and adding their own thing. Then James would move on to the horns, and so on, and so on.\n\nWhile James could be dictatorial and (from the perspective of music education) the least technically qualified person in the room he had *vision*. \n\nIf the song has a strong identity you can give your players a good (non-technical) prompt and they can interpret that through their own sensibilities. You can describe a mood, or a scene, or an abstract sensation.\n\nR. Kelly once said (I'm paraphrasing): \"RnB is supposed to feel like the best moment of your *life*.\" That simple description conveys so much about the feel, the pleasure, and the joy that he is looking for in his music. It also excludes a lot of possibilities as well. If you can give your players a prompt like *that* then you can get everyone aligned on the same wavelength and it will carry you so much further without the need to dictate parts.\n\n----",

    "content": "So I was digging through the Discord for wisdom on comping/tidying/timing/tuning vocals and seems like there's some debate on whether one should time first or tune first. \n\nI like to time first, because:\n\n- AFAIK time-stretching tends to emphasize tuning artifacts, while tuning can actually mask timing artifacts depending on how drastic the timing was.\n\n- I'm often comping doubles from unused lead takes, and then doing a combination of Revoice and editing by hand to line them up, along with harmonies. I find this makes tuning easier, especially when to lining up a slide or melisma.\n\nHOWEVER\n\n- I could be mistaken/misinformed about the first point. I think the amount of artifacts also depends heavily on what DAW/algorithm was used for time-stretching, if it was done at all.\n\n- Tuning can mess with timing. We all saw the AT conversation a few days ago, and Matt Beckley pointed out in a post a while back that Melodyne can also make timing a little wonky sometimes.\n\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- Is this just one of those 'it depends' situations?\n\n- You can do both timing and tuning in Melodyne, although (to me) it feels a little more artifacty and a lot more time-consuming than working by hand and applying stretching, etc. as needed.\n\n@BatMeckley @NoahNeedleman I feel like you two probably have the most expertise here - advice greatly appreciated.",

But if you're not stretching audio, I can't see any real benefit. There's *plenty* of pitch based information for it to work with @ 44/48... but it really comes down to how savvy the code is. I'm an Autotune graphical mode user and I'm pretty sure that tech is stuck firmly in 1998.",

    "content": "Method: Recorded vocal at 192kHz into Pro Tools. Exported via Shift+CMD+K at 192kHz and again at 48kHz. Vocals were both imported into Melodyne application in monophonic mode. Administered time stretching (both lengthened and shortened) via the time tool. Also administered pitch shifting via pitch tool and checked detection of tuning via correct pitch macro. After exporting these, they were reimported to see if detection had changed.\n\nObjective Results:\n-Upon import, vocal tempo detection was different. (One detected in 5/4, the other in 3/4, at drastically different tempos).\n-For short notes, when using the time tool to stretch, there were audible differences in results.\n-For long notes, when using the time tool to shorten, there was significantly less audible difference (subjectively: no difference)\n-For pitch detection, the algorithm detected pitch differently both audibly and visually.\n\nSubjective Opinions:\n-Time stretching yielded reduced artifacts in extreme settings when done at 192kHz. It did not eliminate all artifacts, but did reduce them.\n-When time stretching in a more nuanced way, the differences in artifacts were negligible.\n-When adjusting pitch manually, there was no audible difference in the quality of the pitch shifting at different sample rates. (For this test, everything was shifted up half an octave before any adjustments made)\n-When detecting pitch, both behaved quite differently. This was partially due to detection of select blobs being different at either sample rate. (This was most surprising to me of all the results)\n-When blobs were adjusted to match as closely as possible by hand, the tuning seemed to behave identically, including locations and levels of artifacts. (My gut says they \u201cfelt\u201d different but that is most likely either placebo or the slight differences in true blob locations)",

I've spent about 4 hours on this outro trying to figure out how to move the fades around to make it work but this one particular phrase was not coming together and there weren't other usable takes either. \n\nWhat I've done so far is I added a little decresc and cresc that wasn't there before, which made it more natural and was still musically appropriate. And did some audio suite EQ moves to match the formant as best as I can between the two takes. and then messed around with clip gain automation and fade points and shapes to see if I can get them to connect seamlessly. \n\nI could probably do it better next year, but this needs to be done now - so I think I'm just gonna go ahead and put on a reverb throw haha:kekcry:",

How do I go about this sort of pseudo group vocal sound. Big, clearly layered. Is it a matter of standing in different places in the room and recording several layers, simply singing different, harmonies, different mics... etc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRJKB291Z1g\n01:00 vocals at the chorus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYLxUJ9v6KU\n00:46 Vocals at chorus\n\n\nThis is out of my typical realm so any advice with ANY big pop vocal production would be really cool.",

I do not have any desires to go beyond that. \n\nBUT\n\nI don\u2019t ever want to edit my timing other than micro adjustments that can be done by moving small part of audio clip or hitting quantize. \n\nThat + being more consistent with touch so I don\u2019t have to punch in as much",

If I\u2019ve done my part already and completed it, do I keep bothering them to get their parts done? (lyrics etc) \n\nI read your reply to someone asking about writing sessions, and you said your biggest goal is to get the vocals from the first spark of inspiration on that same day. I\u2019ve had sessions where I get a basic bone of ideas with beat done, and top line is done but the lyrics are recorded in Gibberish and stream of consciousness. I would return, complete the arrangement on my own - send it back, they said they fuck with it and tells me they will finish the lyrics. How long do I wait, do I follow up at all, or do I just move on and keep making more? I don\u2019t want to overstep or rush people (and.. I can\u2019t get anyone to anything of course), but I also want to get the song done while I\u2019m excited so I can keep moving forward.

I love love love Halloween, the chorus just punches me in the guts, but what else punched me in the guts was that the gatekeeping by the guy. I mean music and art in general is supposed to be moving culture forward, right??. Old man has had his plate of cake throughout his career, whats wrong if he teaches the knowledge to a new generation, that way more talent comes out and we get to hear amazing music in the future. Not to degrade his work, Ethan Gruska and Tony has done a phenomenal job on the album.  I would never, Personally gatekeep any knowledge if i made something like Punisher, The Album Is THAT GOOD. Thats what i would do. Not judging anyone whatsoever, but felt bad to see a producer i look upto \u201cGatekeep\u201d sauce just so no one is on his level soundwise.",

Additionally, I think there's also someone in a lower register doubling the soprano melody an octave lower. So some notes in the lower octave are the correctly tracked parts that were sung an octave lower, whereas others are the wrongly detected notes which were supposed to be an octave higher. \n\nI'll ask the singer how many voices where doing the soprano part and how many were doing the lower octave so it might become a little bit clearer\n\nI'll send a screenshot where I completely muted the correctly detected soprano notes. However, even with that, I can still hear other voices singing the melody. (the greyed out areas in the screenshot singing around the high B is the soprano melody)\n\n(It's not that big of a deal bc it's just for an IG reel and the singer-friend is happy with the result, but I'm just curious if there's an easier way around this).",

But I think we can dig a bit deeper.\n\nI like to work in a way during tracking/production that\u2019s maybe a bit more old school with shooting for around -18dbFS on the average. It gives me a kind of fixed reference in my mind which gives me enough headroom for most dynamics. Now the important part is you have to turn up your monitoring/headphones volume to be adequately loud to work with those lower levels and then leave it there.That being said it might be necessary to bring down other pre existing tracks that are too loud.\n\nNow since the volume of the monitoring/headphones stays the same during that tracking session you can use the gain of your preamp (or the output gain of the compressor, if you\u2019re using one on the way in) to adjust the vocal or instrument so that for every part of the arrangement it feels right. So in a sense you are pre mixing during the recording, taking off some work down the line",

The part is kind of loose and not always locked-in with the bass and guitar, so maybe they overdubbed a harmonica at double speed, so that it would play back an octave lower.

    "content": "My current approach to this involves a couple of principles, but this is the first that comes to mind:\n\n1. If there\u2019s a part with bg vocals performing different lines than the lead and there\u2019s a lot going on, I try to have a spot earlier in the song where the exactly lines those BGs are performing have a moment to shine. For example, if there\u2019s a low energy bridge where they can be clearly understood before the big hook where they can be perceived but not understood as well in the midst of so much. \n\nWhat this does is allow the listeners brain to process what\u2019s being said with little effort, and then later when it\u2019s in a tornado they can still perceive what it\u2019s saying because they recognize it as something their brain already knows, so it\u2019s not overwhelming for their brain to understand the words of multiple vocals going at once if there are layers of lines being performed (usually syncopated) around each other.\n\nThis applies to instruments as well, but instead of intelligibility of words I focus more on cutting frequencies so everything can fit well in the big moments. If they head a synth at full power in the intro and it comes back for a final hook, you can get away with cutting a lot of meat off of it and still have it be perceived as the same synth, without muddying the mix and also creating a nice \u2018bringing the song full circle\u2019 feeling - If the track calls for that.\n\nI typed this off the cuff based in gut instinct so not standing by this message as full proof, but this all feels right to me as I explore what I have done for tracks, without having this much thought or words to it.",

The lead is performing a part that\u2019s trying to overcome anxieties, and the BGs are saying full lines with the anxieties from before.\n\nPanning was essential to create the effect of the anxieties around the lead, but I found that if I introduced them as panned BGs they were hard to make out behind the lead.\n\nBecause of this, knowing when to make a moment earlier in the song to spotlight what would later be panned made those lines more intelligible once they were in the BG to the sides, because the listeners brain recognized it from an earlier section.\n\nDoes that make sense? I can struggle to explain what I\u2019m doing in practice and this is my attempt, so my bad if it sounds like gobrish",

Then play the middle note one octave up and play some other notes with the right hand after main chord hits. Also stacking two chord progressions on top each other, most of the time ones that a more talented piano player could play at once.",

These are chords that are made from the notes in your major or minor scale.\n\n**For example:** In the key of F, your diatonic chords are these:\n\nF, Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, E dim.\n\nYou can play any of those chords and they'll fit right in. Those are your \"can't lose\" chords that will sound coherent no matter what. I would start here by chaining some of these chords together and seeing how they sound. They're like words in a sentence that you can rearrange to say different things.",

Ive made huge rearrangements and changes to this song probably 5-6 times by this point, and always came back to it thinking it still isnt there. The basic concept is alluring but my execution is lacking. \n\nSo most people say \"scrap it\", if the song doesnt come easy then its not meant to be, and you\u2019re better served making a new track entirely. Maybe integrate the best ideas, but start over. You\u2019re in too deep and you\u2019ll never hear it for what it is by this point.",

Logic has flex pitch but reliable people I've talked to say it doesn't have nearly the transparency as the other two. I also don't know anyone who uses it over Auto-tune or Melodyne.",

Chords are what gives your song harmonic motion and a sense of going places. They can give it tension and release. A good progression will show you where to take the song next.\n\nOr you can write a melody first and then come up with chords underneath it. Whichever feels more natural to you.
