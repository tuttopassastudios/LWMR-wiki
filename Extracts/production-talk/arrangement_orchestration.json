Very much a texture and not a featured instrument most of the time, and it's just incredible how even those background parts elevate the music beyond the samples that were in there. Getting goosebumps over here, a reminder that injecting humanity into our music is so important.",

Hint: it\u2019s very rarely strictly the sonics and/or mix. That Olivia Rodrigo album sounded objectively terrible, but FELT awesome. And that\u2019s what mattered in the end.  Benny Blanco became successful with a folder full of songs at 120 bpm cause he didn\u2019t know how to change the tempo, and stacks of kick drums because he didn\u2019t know how to eq (he just layers a brighter kick on top if it needs more snap). When I\u2019d ask him why he pretty much did anything it was always \u201cI dunno, man, it just sounds cool!\u201d. Make sure you\u2019re attacking the work with that kind of mindset. \n\nWhen I get lost in the minutiae I try to zoom out and just be like \u201cdoes this whole track feel good? Am I instinctually bobbing my head?\u201d And if not, why?\n\n95% of the songs that people have sent me here, the issue hasn\u2019t been their space, or their monitoring, or whether they used a 60s or 70s guitar, or if they mixed analog or in the box. The issues almost always tend to be much less narrow in scope. Make sure you zoom out and just go \u201cis this cool?\u201d",

He could write every single note of a big band chart if he wanted to, but he (with a few early exceptions) never did this.\n\nHis recipe for music making was this: \n\nA) Start with a great song (chords and melody)\nB) Curate a team of players with their own strong musical identities \nC) Bring them together and let them interpret the song\nD) Direct them on feel and how to listen to and respond to each other\n\nThat's it. Miles' music was never about big arranging moments, or written-out parts. He started with great raw material, great players, and great prompting and then he let them roam free and play.\n\nSo that's one more way to approach it. \n\nThere are two things that I keep coming back to in all of this: A great song and a vision. If you have those you can set your players free to surprise and astound you.",

    "content": "By far, the most important element in realistic orchestral sound is in the programming. You need a controller where you can automate cc1 and cc11 (modulation and expression). Instruments, especially strings, are constantly changing their volumes. Particularly on entrances and phrase-ends. If you don't have a controller for this, you can draw it all in, but that gets really tedious.\n\nIf you get that figured out, I can almost guarantee that just about any library out there will get you good results. So then it's just a matter of what sound do you gravitate towards, how elaborate of a feature set do you need, etc. Legatos are overrated and I'd take no legato over a poorly programmed one any day.\n\nIf you want a full orchestra, not just strings, I'd check out some of the all-in-one offerings from Spitfire (Albion, BBC Orchestra, or Abbey Road), East West, Orchestral Tools (Inspire), or VSL (Prime). They all will have several different articulations, a decent amount of dynamic layers, and a full set of orchestral instruments. Have a listen to them and see what sounds grab you. Spitfire and Orchestral Tools have a more prominent room sound baked in, but they all do to some extent. So be aware that, whichever library you choose, there's a certain amount of \"reverb\" (which is actually just the hall they're recorded in) that you will never be able to turn off.",

Listen.\n\nWhen it comes to groove or feel it's common for the ensemble to not line up perfectly or even *sound* as if they line up perfectly on transients. Quite often the band are flamming against each other in a way that is tasteful. Sometimes they're dead-on for a beat and the next moment they're doing a tight flam. \n\nDon't get lost solo'ing instruments. Keep the entire song section in perspective when you tweak. If you're having trouble making choices mute a few instruments, but don't solo.\n\nAlso, fader level has a massive influence on groove. Before you start editing too hard play with your fader balances and find the groove that way. Listen to how the proportion of instruments changes the groove. It may turn out you don't need to do much, if any, micro editing.",

Whether it's a drum fill, or a chord voicing that walks up/down into the next section, or tension in the melodic voices, or shortening the notes lengths (staccato, staccatissimo).\n\nThere's also idiomatic noises from the instruments. Guitars have string scrapes, headstock rakes, that cool chattering thing from tapping near the bridge with the edge of your pick. Pianos have big glisses, horns can squeal, bowed strings can sweep a fast legato scale up into the downbeat or do a large gliss.\n\nThen there's foley. I get a *lot* of mileage from sound libraries made for film audio. Foley artists are some creative people and you can go far layering their sounds into instruments at the transitions.",

Vibe is singer-songwriter, soul, RnB.\n\nWe tracked drums, bass, and keys live in the studio OD'd to scratch tracks we cooked up together. The scratch tracks / demos were just guitar vocal and we were really relying on the players to fill out the arrangements, but we knew more would be added down the line.\n\nAll the players were incredible. Could singe your eyebrows off with technical prowess and shredtastic chops. Tracks turned out great, still working on the arrangement, but..\n\nThis project has got me thinking more about the importance of how you present a song to session musicians and the 'space' you ask them to fill in a production. As well as the changing dynamics project to project affected by a revolving cast of participants, more fleshed out demos, etc... I find this a really interesting topic. Curious if anyone in the group has any unique experiences or insights whether as a producer or a musician.\n\nI've found that the more I flesh out demos with the artist beforehand the more bound and limited the session players we bring in are based off our decisions. This can make ODs more efficient, add a clearer direction, but can also remove the opportunity for the player to really add something special. Sometimes I don't want to be too suggestive b/c I want the players to have more of a blank canvas to work with.",

I'm making my way slowly through this Lanois/Beato interview and am amazed by what Lanois is describing from @ 52:24 to 53:45 regarding his approach to stacking modulations and special effects.\n\nAs he describes it, he's performing and printing his modulation effects (delay, verb, vibrato, pitch shifting, etc) one generation at a time as he iterates through the song. This allows him to fine-tune and perform the modulations on each successive pass so that every moment is honed and responsive enough that it becomes a part within the music, and not just a blanket effects chain.\n\nSo if he's doing pitch-shifted delays, he'll do a pass that goes up a fifth on certain notes and then layer another pass that modulates by a different interval at a select moment instead of leaving everything on throughout the entire section. He's honing each effect in sequence. It shows a tremendous care and sensitivity to the music that he would go through and *perform* each layer with so much intention.\n\nThis feels like a revelation to me and I can't wait to practice this.\n\n(I've cued up the video where they start talking about it)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxP9kKzbCFA&t=3144s",

Flex tune allows you to hit notes that aren't allowed in the key; higher the value, more time you're allowed on that note before it'll snap you to a note in the key. I'll keep it pretty low usually but it all depends on the vocalist. I've never really fucked with natural vibrato. Humanize is nice. Let's longer sustained notes wobble a bit even at high retune speeds. Sometimes I'll really crank it, but it does take away from the autotune effect if that's what you're going for.\nOne other tip is I like to flip to advanced mode and set major/minor in the bottom section (leave top drop down in chromatic). This allows you to bypass or allow certain notes that aren't in the key. So if you wanna hit that flat seven now and then, bingo",

I think it comes down to 2 things for me. \n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n\n1) Choosing Sounds. \n\nIn addition to vibe & genre & emotional intent, each instrument or sample that you pick covers a certain area of the overall picture. Knowing where that part is going to go in the overall arrangement changes how much hi end or low end or wetness (etc.) you want. It also steers performances. \n\n2) Actually Mixing As You Go \n\nOnce a part is recorded, do a quick adjustment so that you hear closer to a finished product. This helps you make better choices about what else needs to be added, (or not added,) and will likely inspire the next step.",

Electronic producers will spend a *lot* of time sculpting the volume envelope relative to the tempo. Trance producers have entire plugins that give them microscopic control over the pitch and volume envelopes of kick drums.\n\n2) **Presentation and proportion**. Is it up-front or does it sink into the back? It's easy for a 4x4 to feel hackneyed or overbearing. Sometimes all you need is a gentle *pat pat pat pat* to tie things together.\n\nA fresh or unconventional texture will open up drastically different feels. People can dance to anything if it's got a 4x4 click, so it doesn't necessarily *need* to be a kick. You can go far using samples and percussion that sit in different registers, but play the same role.\n\n3) **Complimentary instruments**. If the kick is the \"rock\" then the groove is going to come from how everything else swings over that. What's the friction like between the kick and the other elements? If the kick is a \"straight man\", then the other elements pushing off of it are where the magic comes from.",

And try to follow it up with an idea that you think works.  In my case I  said \u201c we all love the foundation and we landed somewhere and that feels good. Now we have to be disciplined and be sure that anything we add is truly adding and not taking us away from our northern star.\u201d  And if you think they have bad ideas that they are glued to, ask questions, why do you feel this part has to be here, what is it doing for the song as a whole?

    "content": "Ooo I love this question. I'm currently on a journey with this idea that 'arranging is mixing'. There are a few things I've learned / frameworks that have been helpful to me recently.\n\nI have noticed that in the past in my own approach to production (as well as with some clients who send me their productions to mix) the way I thought about building the track was like assembling / stacking static blocks on top of each other. This realized more as a mental construct and not fully so in practical application. Intuition still served. But this framing became problematic and I think is endemic in music created with primarily loops and samples.\n\nI remember hearing Jon's comments on his 'temporal approach' to mixing which he wrote about on his site (I believe a link surfaced here a few months back). Some of the language Jon used was helpful to me (i.e. painting with sound). I started to think about my productions instead like film. Each second of each section of the song is a new scene unfolding. Every type of processor then becomes a way to adjust and enhance the emotion of the characters in the story. Not static but changing and adapting to align with the central spirit of the song. I tried to find more useful metaphors (i.e. sommelier of sound, a song tour guide, like I was piloting a space ship and mix elements were asteroids). It's one thing to lay down some parts and call it a song and another to consider what is the experience of these parts through time. I think less experienced engineers and often artists who record themselves are not considering pretty much every one of @Slow Hand 's points which creates a real challenge for the mixer.",

Typically the higher pitched/attacky things like hi hats come earlier than the sub kicks for example but experiment with it and see what sounds good. A song where this is really obvious is say it right by nelly furtado, listen to the way the layers are stacked on the downbeats of the chorus.

In my case, it was string quartet, nylon guitar, percussion, and electronics. That also led to cool \u201cchoices\u201d that came from like, having my violist play a part I made the demo of on a semi-modular mono synth. Ensemble can be a unifying lens to capture your diverse ideas through and give them a sense of unity",

    "content": "Yup! Massive was my go-to for years prior to Massive X.\n\nThe biggest change for me is that the raw oscillators sound far better. The original Massive had a lot of aliasing that could make it sound hazy and flat. Switching over to Massive X it is crystal clear and even buzzy saw waves feel warm, pure, and tactile.\n\nIt has extremely flexible modulation capabilities that I find to be very musical as well as some very comprehensive ADSHR envelopes. It also has four different keyboard tracking curves that you can assign and tweak, which is very important when fine-tuning your patch to make sure that it sounds even across the entire range of keys.\n\nIt has a lot of musical sounding filters that can inject a ton of vibe, or be completely neutral. The *noise* section is robust and very flexible. I use it a lot.\n\nFinally, it has a great-sounding set of internal effects (delay, chorus, saturation, verb, etc) that can be placed anywhere inside of the routing diagram. It's always a bummer when the on-board effects aren't very inspiring. But NI has a strong catalog of well-designed dsp to draw on and integrate into their products, so it's turned out great.\n\nOverall, it's a very robust and well-rounded synthesizer that also does a lot of things extremely well. It can be super clean (like Serum) but also get very dirty, which I appreciate in a synth.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that the preset browser kind of sucks. I prefer the original Massive's browser. NI is well aware and they have been overhauling it and slowly adding new features, so I trust in time this will be made better.",

There's so much overlap between the feature set and if you can get very intuitive with one synth you'll go so much farther.\n\nBack in the day I bought NI's *Komplete* bundle and it was just way too many new instruments too fast. Too many options. I never got to know any of them very well. Most synths have all of the same features that you'll want, but there's still a learning curve for every single one that you have to get over before you can be really expressive. I wish it were as easy as picking up a guitar or a horn where everything is standardized and lies in the same place. But that's part of what makes synths great: Their plasticity.\n\nNowadays the only synths I reach for (unless I need a very specific sound) are *Massive X*, *Razor*, and my Moog Sub 37. The first two are very different and don't share many features. I use the Moog when I don't want to be tethered to my computer. Limiting my available tools has been a net benefit for me.",

The expressive unlock of being highly proficient isn't being pursued like it was in the past decades (before we had so may technological means). People are - broadly speaking - more satisfied these days to settle for records that don't push into that potential.\n\nWhat we lose are the heights of expression that virtuosity unlocks.

So, on a dense score like that you\u2019re going to get massive amounts of micro automation, almost as if you were mapping the vibrato on a guitar solo (x25 different instruments).",

You\u2019re like sucked into another space entirely each time. I\u2019m thinking what you\u2019re mentioning has to be a compression thing, but it could also be some hard EQ manoeuvres, mic choices and playing with space in various ways. But no idea really if I\u2019m honest.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame this album (and other post-Beatles / pre-Wings McCartney material) got such a bad rap at the time tbh. For me this is the sound of someone having a fuck load of fun and not really caring what anyone thinks about it. It\u2019s a bit unhinged at times and a bit corny, but it\u2019s joyful, and it\u2019s the sound of someone growing awkwardly out of their old clothes and finding their way to something new. And it\u2019s a super deep well of Beatlesque music to learn from.",

Then playing with some subtle percussion elements like triangle, clave, wood blocks, to differentiate later choruses.",

And I hardly ever let the down beats of transitions be off grid too. I usually want the sections to be obvious. I also start with going behind the beat first. I have also recently in the last year or so found that if I start with getting the very basic part of the groove right first, I am less likely to overcrowd my production. So before I put hats in, I\u2019ll just put in snare and kick and try and find the groove with just those 2 elements (unless there is some other clear rhythmic element at play) but I feel like if you can\u2019t feel the groove with just the kick and (snare/clap/perc) then it\u2019s not there.",

The best songs tend to be very robust and can be played a dozen different ways because they are fundamentally compelling. If the demo doesn't feel good this way then the song may need more work.\n\nLesser songs will depend on the arrangement or production to be compelling, or only work in a narrow band of styles. Sometimes a song can only work one way. It's okay if this is the case for your song, but then it's up to you to present the demo with the arrangement or elements that are essential to make the song compelling, and that will close off more and more of the instrumental possibilities.\n\nSo if you want to increase the chances of a session player delivering an unexpected, brilliant, idea then set them up for success with a strong song that can be interpreted many ways.\n\n----",

I haven't used BBCSO, but I know it's light on variations in exchange for having a full set of orchestral instruments and articulations at a budget price. Any of Spitfire's main libraries would be fine, or Cinematic Studio Strings, Orchestral Tools.. pretty much anything should do the job as long as it has enough round robins and hopefully at least 4 dynamic layers.",

For context, we\u2019re doing two songs, and one seems to be coming together pretty easily, and the other is the tough one. Been trying to give all their ideas a shot thinking they\u2019ll either work or it\u2019ll be obvious that it\u2019s not the one (which usually leads to a unanimous decision), but he\u2019s concluded that a lot of these ideas will work \u201conce more stuff is in the track.\u201d Curious how to steer us in (what I believe is) a more viable direction in a non domineering way.

And to your point about being patient, I think all we needed was a little more time to try stuff out and get on the same page. A good reminder not to sweat it too hard if I leave a session worried about the current state of the music. Putting it down for the evening and coming back with fresh ears does wonders. (Also should note that \"arrangement decisions\" was a massive oversimplification of the questions we were trying to answer lol).\n\nApologies if this turns into a novel, but would love to share some takeaways. I think the north star point you made is super important and well put. I think the artist I was working with got more comfortable trying new ideas the more he realized we were both aiming at the same thing (just approaching it differently). He's also only recorded / released one song before (and doesn't have much prior experience collaborating), so I totally understand the fear of things sounding different than he imagined. That's not a knock on the artist at all - I say that matter of factly and it's where everybody starts.\n\n@NoahNeedleman made an analogy about being a \"doctor vs a doula\" which I found super insightful. I think I was afraid that trying to be a \"doctor\" at all was somehow inherently an ego move or underestimating the artist's instincts. Ended up concluding that the project required a little bit of both, and that it's 100% okay and helpful to know where my experience could help us reach the artist's intention. I think interpreting the artist's intention is so much of the job, and if they don't yet have the tools or experience, that may push our job a little more to the doctoring side. There was definitely still some doulaing of course.",

But this doesn\u2019t always add to \u201cfullness\u201d in my mind. It just makes one element better or more interesting. \n\nMaybe start with the loops and foley.

    "content": "Hey, what do **you **consider to be the difference between a song with 'good' production vs. one with 'bad' production? Recently I realized that the term \"production\" gets used in a lot of different ways. I used to think everybody meant more or the less what I consider production to be: the recording or engineering of the sounds in the song (so, sound design too), the layering or vertical arrangement of instruments and sounds, and (to a lesser degree) the way those sounds are balanced/mixed to fit together. What made me reconsider this definition was hearing a handful of reviews for the new Charli XCX album criticize the \"production\" on songs like this one:",

I'll play with forward swing and dragging notes a lot if I'm going for a more real/dynamic feel when programming. keeping in mind that if the goal is trying to stay \"on time\" any fwd swing that might happen at the start of a phrase will be compensated with some drag  after or vice versa.  keeping velocities in mind w drum hits + linking it to a filter env so that harder hits have more high end and softer hits end up a bit rounder.\n\nadding subtle layers that are similar   to the main drums but occupy a different texture or tone  in dif  sections to thicken up the groove or automate the attack /sustain of certain elements thru diff sections to help shift the listener  focus throughout",

    "content": "Ahhh gotcha. That's a cool goal.\n\nSo it sounds like part of what you're seeking are techniques to add pitched resonance to samples that may be atonal?\n\nWell a resonator is a great start. If you're not already into it, I'd look into the karplus-strong theorem and physical modeling synthesis. That whole field has a lot of overlap with what you're describing. It's the kind of thing you'd hear Sophie or Jimmy Edgar do with their Elektron Monomachine.\n\n*AAS* have a whole suite of physical modeling products that function similar to *resonator*, but are third-party plugins. Doing percussion synthesis with *Chromaphone* can do a pretty convincing recreation of certain percussion tones with the added bonus of being as flexible as a synthesizer, because it is a synthesizer!\n\nYou could tune a high-feedback delay unit until it rings at the pitch you're seeking. I can elaborate if you need more explanation. Funnily, that's the entire basis for physical modeling synthesizers.\n\nAlternately, you could layer your samples with gently-blended sine tones. That's worth a try too. I know a lot of EDM producers are into this.",

    "content": "All of these methods suggested will yield in different results. \n\nResonators are made from delay using feedback to create tones. So you may need to resample to kill sustains - or not if you want it to have lengthiness. If you are going for SOPHIE kind of sound then you'd probably keep the feedback. \n\nBooms (filter resonance) are similar mechanisms but less tonal unless you turn up the feedback a lot more - it will certainly be more natural sounding as opposed to comb-filtery sound. \n\nLayering will give more focused pitch while maintaining the integrity of the layered sample sound, you would probably have the most control this way. \n\nVocoder will have inherently baked sound because of the synthesis mechanism, it can be desirable or not depending on the scenario. \n\nWith sampler looping, you will get grainier tail - dialing in the decay is necessary if you want the sound to be percussive because it will just continue sustaining. You can create pads this way too!",

Then the DAW does an offline pass when bouncing where it uses an AI model to fill in the blanks to make the legatos feel convincing. Or maybe it interpolates tongue-slaps into the performance in a way that carries over the resonance from the prior notes, or colors \"outside the lines\" by injecting a certain amount of \"frenzy\" into the playing that modulates pitch, intensity, timing, or overall \"vibe\". Or maybe it makes the timbre \"a little more Duke Ellington and less John Williams\". Or maybe it renders a double-tracked horn that's not just a pitch-modulated version of the source audio file.",

I have no problem letting go when it calls for it. I believe there\u2019s a difference between wanting to be better and working towards it vs not being able to move on out of fear and holding onto something without knowing the next move. If that was the case I wouldn\u2019t have sent what I first recorded to the artist. I may have wasted some time thinking I would be able to get this part down, but I don\u2019t think I was being a perfectionist by doing that. \n\nre: 2\n\nWhy would he do this if he\u2019s a great guitarist? Is it a workflow preference or the aesthetic of edit/sampling? I can only imagine it being faster playing the parts in rather than stitching bits together. \n\n\n\nThe whole goal is to be able to consistently reproduce that magical groove, and being able to create great moments when I am with other people. I really believe I have a good sense of groove but can\u2019t execute it just yet. \n\nI can see myself spending countless hours editing myself. (Which I already do daily). That time is better spent working on my chops. If I can hire other musicians so I can stop wasting time trying multiple takes, I would. But I don\u2019t have that just yet. I go by sections or measures most of the time, I don\u2019t just sit there trying to nail ONE perfect take.",

If I\u2019ve done my part already and completed it, do I keep bothering them to get their parts done? (lyrics etc) \n\nI read your reply to someone asking about writing sessions, and you said your biggest goal is to get the vocals from the first spark of inspiration on that same day. I\u2019ve had sessions where I get a basic bone of ideas with beat done, and top line is done but the lyrics are recorded in Gibberish and stream of consciousness. I would return, complete the arrangement on my own - send it back, they said they fuck with it and tells me they will finish the lyrics. How long do I wait, do I follow up at all, or do I just move on and keep making more? I don\u2019t want to overstep or rush people (and.. I can\u2019t get anyone to anything of course), but I also want to get the song done while I\u2019m excited so I can keep moving forward.

I've also got the *Spitfire BBC Symphony* but I'm less fond of those because they're recorded from an orchestral perspective and have a lot of room sound baked in, whereas *Session Strings 2* have a closer perspective. If you want an ensemble sound plus some major grit and close-miking I *do* like the *Bernard Hermann* orchestral library from Spitfire.\n\nFor solo strings the *NI Cremona Quartet* instruments are really, really nice. They're a pleasure to play with and sound fantastic. These have maximum presence too, so you can get some very direct sounds with them. I'm really enjoying them. The articulation and tonal options are extremely thorough.\n\nA while back a few people recommended *Sunset Strings* by Realitone. While I haven't used it yet, they look very promising. They seem to be serving people who want a rock/pop string feel, which could be just the ticket.",

Then messing with the sample size and you get some interesting glitchy textures.\nTurning the distortion and saturation up miniscule amoubts (about 0.1-0.3%) also rly helps to make vocals more intelligible \nOn top of that, it\u2018s also rly great if u rly wanna f*ck up a sound. It truly is a great plugin",

Interestingly i haven\u2019t seen this yet, but as for other vid clips i have seen, in one of them, tony is gatekeeping a plugin they used to get that smooth texture throughout the album Punisher, by phoebe bridgers. I love love love Halloween, the chorus just punches me in the guts, but what else punched me in the guts was that the gatekeeping by the guy. I mean music and art in general is supposed to be moving culture forward, right??. Old man has had his plate of cake throughout his career, whats wrong if he teaches the knowledge to a new generation, that way more talent comes out and we get to hear amazing music in the future. Not to degrade his work, Ethan Gruska and Tony has done a phenomenal job on the album.  I would never, Personally gatekeep any knowledge if i made something like Punisher, The Album Is THAT GOOD. Thats what i would do. Not judging anyone whatsoever, but felt bad to see a producer i look upto \u201cGatekeep\u201d sauce just so no one is on his level soundwise.",

I have been using it for a while now.

I dived into phoebe\u2019s stuff just last week, funny that it took me 4 year to check out an Amazing album even thou i have been following her on instagram since 2020. What blew me up was, most of the modern productions in the pop side of industry, the sad songs, all of them are inspirationally ripping phoebe\u2019s sound. I was mad at tony berg when i saw his interview where he gatekept a vst they used throughout the album to get that muffled texture. But in the past two days, i also realised he said \u201cWe are not going to tell you the vst just so you at home can not replicate the sound\u201d. I thought that was asshollery until i realised that they are actually being ripped so hard in the industry and that they really gotta protect their sound. Tony, Phoebe, Ethan these guys are hidden unknown diamonds \u201ci think (like me) a lot of people know phoebe as a celebrity than a music artist, or that was just me being lazy to check out her songs\u201d but i feel like everyone needs to experience their music.",

    "content": "Hey guys! Hope everyone is doing well. I have a question\u2014 when setting up to record vocals, what levels do you generally let the volume peak at, and how does one work with dynamic performances? And a specific question: what should I keep the gain at on my interface?\n\nThis recent project has a very whisper-like vocal section that requires a little more gain, and then a lot of loud vocals that require less gain. \n\nThis ends up leaving me having to either turn up the clip gain during mixing or turning up the bus, which leads to clipping. Or (something I really don\u2019t like, because I tend to hear it a lot more) is adjusting the gain while tracking sections. There\u2019s certainly a way to navigate this seamlessly, but I just don\u2019t know it yet :stare:",

    "content": "I want to chime in here, I mostly agree with what the others said and as long as you don\u2019t unintentionally clip all is well. But I think we can dig a bit deeper.\n\nI like to work in a way during tracking/production that\u2019s maybe a bit more old school with shooting for around -18dbFS on the average. It gives me a kind of fixed reference in my mind which gives me enough headroom for most dynamics. Now the important part is you have to turn up your monitoring/headphones volume to be adequately loud to work with those lower levels and then leave it there.That being said it might be necessary to bring down other pre existing tracks that are too loud.\n\nNow since the volume of the monitoring/headphones stays the same during that tracking session you can use the gain of your preamp (or the output gain of the compressor, if you\u2019re using one on the way in) to adjust the vocal or instrument so that for every part of the arrangement it feels right. So in a sense you are pre mixing during the recording, taking off some work down the line",

    "content": "My current approach to this involves a couple of principles, but this is the first that comes to mind:\n\n1. If there\u2019s a part with bg vocals performing different lines than the lead and there\u2019s a lot going on, I try to have a spot earlier in the song where the exactly lines those BGs are performing have a moment to shine. For example, if there\u2019s a low energy bridge where they can be clearly understood before the big hook where they can be perceived but not understood as well in the midst of so much. \n\nWhat this does is allow the listeners brain to process what\u2019s being said with little effort, and then later when it\u2019s in a tornado they can still perceive what it\u2019s saying because they recognize it as something their brain already knows, so it\u2019s not overwhelming for their brain to understand the words of multiple vocals going at once if there are layers of lines being performed (usually syncopated) around each other.\n\nThis applies to instruments as well, but instead of intelligibility of words I focus more on cutting frequencies so everything can fit well in the big moments. If they head a synth at full power in the intro and it comes back for a final hook, you can get away with cutting a lot of meat off of it and still have it be perceived as the same synth, without muddying the mix and also creating a nice \u2018bringing the song full circle\u2019 feeling - If the track calls for that.\n\nI typed this off the cuff based in gut instinct so not standing by this message as full proof, but this all feels right to me as I explore what I have done for tracks, without having this much thought or words to it.",

The lead is performing a part that\u2019s trying to overcome anxieties, and the BGs are saying full lines with the anxieties from before.\n\nPanning was essential to create the effect of the anxieties around the lead, but I found that if I introduced them as panned BGs they were hard to make out behind the lead.\n\nBecause of this, knowing when to make a moment earlier in the song to spotlight what would later be panned made those lines more intelligible once they were in the BG to the sides, because the listeners brain recognized it from an earlier section.\n\nDoes that make sense? I can struggle to explain what I\u2019m doing in practice and this is my attempt, so my bad if it sounds like gobrish",

    "content": "I've run into a weird dilemma and I'd love some advice/guidance. A pop track I'm producing on sounds great on the ears instrumentally and vocally, but I keep thinking it could have *more* going on to compliment it. Kind of like adding sprinkles onto a cake. However, I go to to explore other elements (extra vocal layers, extra synths, etc.) and it just throws this feeling of balance off. It's probably a mental barrier after listening to what the demo sounds like so much, but at the same time, I think the track could objectively benefit from some filling out.",

    "content": "What about when _many_ tasks become easy, thereby clearing the path to do even harder things?\n\nAll the art we make now - music, film/tv, video games... all possible because lots of subordinate tasks became easier. \n\nI firmly subscribe to Wagner's concept of Gesamtkunstwerk (Total Artwork), my take on which is that as art forms become easier to do, they are subordinated to even greater, more total art forms\n\nThe example I like to use is a videogame. Making a AAA game needs writers, artists, composers, actors, programmers.... video games are (I think?) by far the largest form of cultural output in economic terms because they're so encompassing of so many human skills\n\nNow that those human skills are getting easier with AI assistance, what's next? How does art, culture, entertainment become even _bigger_, what does our next great format of cultural output look like?\n\nWent a little off-topic for this channel but I am constantly thinking about this",

    "content": "Maybe it's just my taste, but if I'm sequencing sampled instruments I'm not trying to sample guitars and I don't think we need another drum library, either. Drums and percussion already translate well to sampling (for the most part). \n\nI want strings and woodwinds, or brass. Gimme some of that, and make it something with some real energy and excitement. Their platform seems capable of expressing things that traditional sampled instruments cannot do, so lean into those strengths and make the parts a little more opinionated. A little more unique.",
