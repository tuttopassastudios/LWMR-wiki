Not sure what kind of music you're making but for my workflow I like doing whatever I feel on a production and then having quick \"modern\" drum sounds I can reach for that immediately can put things into the present.\n\nI'm doing a production right now for a UK artist where they gave me a throwback sounding demo, but I know the artist is a young 2023 female pop star. So I did a bunch of organic shit (acoustic through my 67, some live claps, shit like that), then I threw some kshmr and oliver loops in to just see what the hybrid of classic and modern sounds like. Production is basically done now",

In my experience it\u2019s 50/50 whether they want tuned or raw, comped or all the takes- etc. \n\nThe key things that keep me getting called are, in no particular order:\n\nCommunication. Everybody knows what to expect and what is to be expected. \n\nProfessionalism. The room is clean, mics are up, lighting is right, session is loaded. \n\nIntuition. All the artistic/personal things. Making the artist feel safe enough to be dangerous, knowing how hard you can push them to get a take, knowing where the line is between their vision and yours, etc\u2026\n\nSonics. I want my artists to feel expensive when they\u2019re recording, so getting the mic and cue mix right is everything. \n\nSpeed. A comp up by the time they\u2019re done tracking, a quick shine to make it feel special, and a bounce for them to take with them.\n\nEverything else is on a per session basis. I can deliver a fully mixed/tuned vocal and everything in between, so it all depends on communication ahead of time.",

Think Andrew Watt handled the vocals on that and did a fantastic job getting the take out of Luke. Dance Hall Days by Wang Chung is always a good reference. Mercy Street by Peter Gabriel (the whole SO record) pretty unfuckwithable. Bang Bang is always a great reference because you can really show a singer the difference between a Jessie J and an Arianna. Comes in handy in sessions a lot.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for creative, the whole Dissociatives record is a constant reference. I\u2019d start with \u201cHorror With Eyeballs\u201d",

I had tried them once at @oaklandmatt\u2019s place and wasn\u2019t super impressed... just thought they sounded like hyped headphones. But I really wanted something with killer noise cancellation and something to potentially reference Spatial mixes. After purchasing, the more I used them, the more I fell in love with listening to music on them. I realized quite early on that there was a lot of parity between how things sounded in the APMaxes vs. my PMC 6-2s\u2026 similar low end presentation, similar high end. But just genuinely enjoyed listening to music on them.\n\nI was traveling for thanksgiving last year and a last minute mix opportunity came up for some video game trailer. Not my normal speed but they were up shits creek with a deadline and the money was good\u2026 so I mixed the whole thing start to finish on my laptop with the Airpods. I was a little sheepish about sending off un-vetted mixes, but the clients loved it and I saved the day. I curiously took a listen when I got back to my studio after the holiday and was very surprised that the mix was 98% there. There was maybe a small low end tweak I could\u2019ve made, but by and large, the mixes translated incredibly well. \n\nNow I use them much more for odd tasks, usually revisions and printing sessions. I can be on my couch on my laptop running files down with transparency mode on, still hanging with my family while watching a show, and lock in with noise cancelling when I need to focus.\n\nFor $600 they\u2019ve been a massive value-add to my work flow.",

But the best way is to just get more reps to get faster and better. 10,000 hours, no shortcuts.\n\nBut more actionable advice - stick to a slim number of EQ and Compressor plugs and just use those. For example 99% of my mixes just use pro q3, API-2500, and Kush AR-1. The idea being minimize variables and decisions, and use stuff you know ridiculously well.\n\nProduction side, I find having go to sounds, samples, and instruments (hardware or software) well learned and ready to go shortens the path from opening your project to creating music. For me, this is taking my free time to mess with my MPC and explore samples, or to create patches on my synths to become more intertwined with my instruments. This is separate from the actual \u201cI\u2019m gonna make a song today\u201d process.\n\nUltimately\u2026make a song in 8 hours as many days as you can.

    "content": "That\u2019s so funny. I JUST had this experience a month or so ago and hit up @oaklandmatt for tips. I can say that in my personal experience working with boy (and girl) bands, there\u2019s a couple things that come into play. First, you have to do your research and see how many are singers, and what they\u2019re good at. This last project I did all 5 dudes were RIDICULOUSLY good singers, but one had a particularly sweet falsetto, one had a really good rasp in their voice, etc. Once I discovered that it was much easier to figure out who got what parts and what features. It\u2019s a nice tact to make sure everyone has at least a moment where they shine. Other ensemble groups I worked with only had 50% of the band be actual \u201csingers\u201d and the other members were there for other reasons. It\u2019s good to know what\u2019s what before going in. \n\nThe second part that comes into play (sadlly) is the inevitable politics. Someone usually thinks they\u2019re the star (they might be right). Usually the label has a favorite or two (I actually had an A&R person pull me aside before a session once and say \u201cwe\u2019re gonna pull _____ solo in a year, so make sure to give them all the good parts\u201d). I\u2019ve found that having them all there at the same time has the bonus of them challenging and supporting each other (no one wants to suck in front of their team) but also make sure you have something fun for the other 4 or 5 to do cause they\u2019ll get bored waiting for their turn at the mic quick. \n\nLastly, preparation is key. Have tracks already laid out ready to record before they get there. Anticipate what you\u2019ll need. Template it out. Having 4 or 5 singers is 4 or 5 times the work. Little things like creating new tracks or whatever become real time suckers. It\u2019s a lot of different singers to cram into a day or two so be extra prepared.\n\nHopefully some of that helps.",

Every time I complimented her after a take, she screwed up the next one. If I said a take was bad the next one would be great. The session quickly devolved in to me just saying increasingly awful things after every take, much to her mom\u2019s delight who was laughing on the back couch.\n\nI\u2019ve said this over and over again on this server, but people skills and just sheer musical awareness and taste trump technical ability and gear every time (the how vs the why). If I\u2019m needing Kirk to record an incendiary angry solo in the middle of a heavy, emotional song, I\u2019m probably not gonna set up flowers in the studios and kick it off with a warm stone massage.  Your job as a producer is to get the best out of the artist, and a good producer will have a feel for what that specific artist needs.(A Rick Rubin specialty).",

But, if you took one home and used it as your one pre across 100 tracks of your masterpiece, even your parents are going to hear the difference between it and a vintage neve. That small 5% difference really added up at the end. I\u2019m sure after floor two of the leaning tower of Pisa the engineers we\u2019re like \u201clookin good boss! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc \u201c and it wasn\u2019t til they compounded their error that people started to panic.\nIf you\u2019re making tracks 95% in the box with samples and soft synths and then just drop a featured rapper on top of it, it\u2019s probably not going to matter if you use a Scarlett or an Apollo or an Apogee.

    "content": "Wanted to share some thoughts spurred on by a recent experience on here. So a local artist has hired me to produce two of her songs. Vibe is singer-songwriter, soul, RnB.\n\nWe tracked drums, bass, and keys live in the studio OD'd to scratch tracks we cooked up together. The scratch tracks / demos were just guitar vocal and we were really relying on the players to fill out the arrangements, but we knew more would be added down the line.\n\nAll the players were incredible. Could singe your eyebrows off with technical prowess and shredtastic chops. Tracks turned out great, still working on the arrangement, but..\n\nThis project has got me thinking more about the importance of how you present a song to session musicians and the 'space' you ask them to fill in a production. As well as the changing dynamics project to project affected by a revolving cast of participants, more fleshed out demos, etc... I find this a really interesting topic. Curious if anyone in the group has any unique experiences or insights whether as a producer or a musician.\n\nI've found that the more I flesh out demos with the artist beforehand the more bound and limited the session players we bring in are based off our decisions. This can make ODs more efficient, add a clearer direction, but can also remove the opportunity for the player to really add something special. Sometimes I don't want to be too suggestive b/c I want the players to have more of a blank canvas to work with.",

If you want them to add their own flavor, take the reigns off and tell them to have at it. Both ways are useful, and a good session musician will be adept at doing both. Bad session musicians will try to cross those lines one way or the other.\n\nIn my sessions i almost always have a clear vision of what I want, have whoever I brought in execute it, and then I save a little time for them to do their thing, and seek a bit of magic that I might have missed.

And I was horrified cause my bass was sounding nowhere near as good and I knew the other player had the same type of bass. The only thing that could effect the sound was the tone knob and as soon as I moved it to around halfway it perfectly fit in the mix and sounded as good as the other bass player - has been the biggest key to getting a good sound in the studio",

The first thing is: the correction is only as good as the detection\u2026 so it\u2019s worth a quick run through to make sure it\u2019s mapped the vocal take properly.  Sometimes it gets a syllable or two in the wrong octave, and rarer times it\u2019ll get it wrong a fourth or fifth off. I\u2019m not sure the process for correcting that in the plug in off the top of my head. Once you\u2019ve got the detection right\u2026\n\nThe  next step is understanding how we fundamentally sing; a note tends to have a front end or consonance, the meat of the note, and then lastly the tail. You want to separate the meat of the note out, and concentrate on tuning that. Also remember that the \u201cblob\u201d is just an average of the tuning info in it, meaning if your note slides from C to E, melodyne will correct that blob to D. (I hope that makes sense.)",

I'm no Beckley, but browsing whats been previously shared here and trial and error has been the mechanism of growth for me.\n\nI kinda had the note separation tool workflow down from work in other programs. I've been experimenting with the time tool and attack speed tool as well as formant shifting to mask when the tuning becomes more audible than I'd like. That's probably where I'd pinpoint the level up for me personally. That and trying to be more conscious about not relying too much on the graphical UI. Unless it's something that really calls for hard tuning I lean towards wanting it to feel invisible / natural. Im realizing more what parts of the note actually need to be more 'on' and which can be more 'off' or just left alone. That and letting notes naturally drift to become more sharp as they tail off. If I'm too heavy handed it starts to feel lifeless to me. I'm also appreciating more the nuance of how one might approach different genres or styles with melodyne. Its humbling how powerful the program really is.\n\nThere've been a few moments with the attack speed tool that have felt like magic curing some subtleties of the performances that bug me, but I don't feel super confident that I have a grasp on that one yet. I've been working in standalone and importing a REF mix. For some reason I feel more confident dealing with esses in protools with RX or clip gain than I do melodyne idk why. Some frustrations have been flipping back and forth between tracks when tuning multiple files feels real clunky. I might be missing something about how best to do that. I wish, like with RX monitor, you could hear the vocal through your mix chain when tuning (is that possible?). Being able to rename exported files would be nice too like in RX.",

I made a record in Nashville a few years ago with engineer Mark Nevers (Bill Callahan, Bonnie Prince, Lambchop etc) and instead of using click tracks he had in his template a load of shakers, side sticks and percussion loops which he had recorded all set with Elastic Audio and Tick based processing. What this meant was he could create a shaker type click just by changing the blend between the samples and pushing the tempo up or down. It worked really well on what was an acoustic based record. The players loved it, and I swear they got master takes quicker without being bludgeoned by the normal click.  Anyone done this before? Is it a Nashville thing?",

I'm from Spain and just recently moved to Madrid looking for opportunities as a songwriter and producer, and it seems like this is one. It's the first time that I'm going to be having to make something on the spot, and I want to do my best. Any tips and tricks? I know the artist, and she trusts me, but we are going to be working with a signed songwriter in Warner's facilities. I'm excited, but a bit scared to not do it well enough.",

Why don\u2019t we take a break? When we come back, let\u2019s forget about everything I mentioned earlier and see how things come out when you express freely. I have a feeling that it\u2019s gonna turn out way better. I\u2019m sorry, I think I got it your way\u201d \n\nthen after the break, the artist started nailing the takes. Not in the exact way I imagined, but in the best possible way that we were capable of THAT DAY. \n\nSince then, I decided to let go of control a bit more and let the artists do their thing as much as I can. I started developing ears for hearing what artists can work on before the session to get a better recording to my best of ability (if I get to know them before the sesh). I would only mention the simple things that can be improved with small adjustments short-term. That way the session can be more experimental and wild as opposed to fault-finding.",

The crummy one she borrowed sounded like a big uke, but the good one I got from my friend Tony made all the difference. The other hack is running the pickup through a good tweed style or projector type amp, and then blending that in to taste in parallel",

    "content": "I feel you, especially in boom bap there's a lot that goes into that drunken swing feel. Same with tradition African groove. Easiest way is to load up a clip or loop from a drummer you like and extracting groove templates. You can quantize to the groove of your favorite drummer or a drum loop you dig. This will get you the results, but groove is a never ending journey of learning. Editing groove to make it feel the way you want to feel takes an understanding of what makes things groove one way or the other. It can be accents, dynamics, lengths of the notes, how much you deviate from the grid or what subdivisions you're on, and how the timing offsets rub and interact with each other in the whole instrumentation. Some drummers have really solid quintuplet swing, so instead of doing tripplet swing they'll play on the downbeat and the 3rd or 4th note of quintuplet. For this you can listen to guys like Nate Smith, he plays swings differently live than recordings- he drags and pushes the kicks and snares in recordings but for live, he only swings hats so there's more steady groove for other musicians to grab onto. \n\nOn the other hand, for playing the grooves yourself- I find it helpful to dance and groove to the rhythms as much as I can to absorb the feel and internalize them. But in order to play ahead or behind with authority, you need to know where the grids are and metronome practice is crucial. I'm not that great at timing either, so I'm trying to do as much reps in with metronomes as I can. Learning to play on the grid is a first step before learning how to deviate with clear intention. I hope this helps!",

They have almost 150-160 GB's of free Library of Pre Recorded sound which are royalty free which has almost everything  you'll need.\n2. Download Soundly(it's Free) and Use it as your Sample Browser for faster workflow as it's search functionality is specifically designed for searching foley sound,sfx,ambience etc(make Sure to Run it as Administrator for windows or it won't drag sounds to ableton) .\n3. Run Ableton in Gridless Mode for perfect timings for placing foley.\n4. Make sure to level and organise similer sounds together on the Go as it will help in later stages for sending stems for mixing.\n5. Going Scene by scene helps for preventing the overwhelm of the Huge Film.\nand all the Best for this Gig\ud83c\udf7b",

I am working with an artist who is in a similar spot and we ended up with an indie folk sound that was a pretty big shift from his social media content. But it was the sound that he heard in his head when he played. To me it's important to make the project that the artist will want to stand behind instead of something that might stream more copies.",

    "content": "As a practical example of when not being in phase is the right move:\n\nJon Castelli did a live mix on Twitch on Wednesday that included live drums. He identified that one of the snare mics sounded fuller when he inverted the polarity and proceeded to mix with that. \n\nLater in that session when it came time for notes, the producer (who was present in the room) asked why the snare had lost a certain thin and \"woody\" character that they liked. Jon reverted the snare mic to it's original polarity and the producer went \"Ahh! There it is.\"\n\nSo the takeaway here is that while drums usually *do* sing the best and hit the hardest when they're all working in phase with one another, sometimes the creative intention overrides the need to align them in a way that makes them most \"full\".\n\nAs you say: If it sounds good, it is good.",

Usually I\u2019ll have beat and vocals separate, but sometimes it makes more sense to have in the same session. Depends on the song. But I always track over a 2 track. Because it takes a lot of risk out of having some random synth or plug-in chain from the production mess up the session while trying to get good takes with the artist.(total buzzkill if you have to restart a session when the vocalist is in the zone) \nBut again soooooo project dependant. Depends on how the artist likes to work, time line, amount of sessions that are possible to have together and so on. Sometimes you\u2019ll only have one day with an artist, and if you are also producing, leave all the cool production tricks til later and get the best vocals you can get.",

Just chords, melody, and lyric. *Maybe* a kick drum pattern. Lead sheet style.\n\nIf the song is good then it will still be compelling. The best songs tend to be very robust and can be played a dozen different ways because they are fundamentally compelling. If the demo doesn't feel good this way then the song may need more work.\n\nLesser songs will depend on the arrangement or production to be compelling, or only work in a narrow band of styles. Sometimes a song can only work one way. It's okay if this is the case for your song, but then it's up to you to present the demo with the arrangement or elements that are essential to make the song compelling, and that will close off more and more of the instrumental possibilities.\n\nSo if you want to increase the chances of a session player delivering an unexpected, brilliant, idea then set them up for success with a strong song that can be interpreted many ways.\n\n----",

I use an MPC, so the lower volume thing would be annoying for my personal use, but that\u2019s an outlier.\n\n3. You could farm out the Battery / Kontakt / etc packs to friends who would be willing to do it or use those tools a lot, that way you\u2019re not stuck making a ton of them (unless you want to of course) \n\n4. I don\u2019t touch loops usually but I know tons of others do. \n\n5. That\u2019s it. Sounds like a super fun and badass project! You should document it on the way on the discord\n\nEdit: I\u2019m speaking to more electronic and supplemental use of drum samples. There are probably tons of folks out there who want all the options as if there was 100% a real drummer recorded in their studio.",

For the first few albums every single tracking take was filmed on an iPhone while they recorded in their living room/bedroom/etc, which allowed Jack Stratton to turn around and release low budget music videos for every single song on the album using the take that made the album.\n\nTheir setup was always lo-fi and charmingly janky in the edit. They just leaned into the artifice of a low-grade camera and built their whole visual style around these simple phone captures of the session.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUyuGjLy4BQ",

Unless you\u2019re in a band, the songs you\u2019re producing aren\u2019t your own (despite how much they feel like they could be). If every artist OP works with hired a shitty mixer for the next 5 years and the only solution he had in mind was to to pay out of pocket, that\u2019s a lot of money he\u2019s losing that could be invested in his own tools and life. This is why I would advocate for a creative problem solving compromise of sorts - find ways to wrap it for free or cheap that don\u2019t suck, or convince the artist to budget better, or learn how to finish out your vision yourself from the rough mixes.",

Or both? \n\n2. I think the equivalent syncing feature in Dropbox would be \"make available offline\". If you right click a folder and \"make available offline\" it will continually update when it receives uploads from the other computer. Have you used that before? It doesn't have the lightning speed of a local network/ethernet connection, but if you can wait a few minutes it's good.\n\n3. I assume these are Ableton sessions. Do you ever use the 'collect all and save' feature when saving sessions? It will gather every external sample (but not sampled instrument libraries) and save them to the project folder, which will save you the trouble of having to point your Ableton session to any external directory, because it will all be in the project folder. Very good when it comes to archiving sessions and opening them up years later.",

    "content": "Love this thought and hear that completely. So funny enough, within the day or two after my original message, everybody was stoked about where we landed. And to your point about being patient, I think all we needed was a little more time to try stuff out and get on the same page. A good reminder not to sweat it too hard if I leave a session worried about the current state of the music. Putting it down for the evening and coming back with fresh ears does wonders. (Also should note that \"arrangement decisions\" was a massive oversimplification of the questions we were trying to answer lol).\n\nApologies if this turns into a novel, but would love to share some takeaways. I think the north star point you made is super important and well put. I think the artist I was working with got more comfortable trying new ideas the more he realized we were both aiming at the same thing (just approaching it differently). He's also only recorded / released one song before (and doesn't have much prior experience collaborating), so I totally understand the fear of things sounding different than he imagined. That's not a knock on the artist at all - I say that matter of factly and it's where everybody starts.\n\n@NoahNeedleman made an analogy about being a \"doctor vs a doula\" which I found super insightful. I think I was afraid that trying to be a \"doctor\" at all was somehow inherently an ego move or underestimating the artist's instincts. Ended up concluding that the project required a little bit of both, and that it's 100% okay and helpful to know where my experience could help us reach the artist's intention. I think interpreting the artist's intention is so much of the job, and if they don't yet have the tools or experience, that may push our job a little more to the doctoring side. There was definitely still some doulaing of course.",

Modal synthesis is also another cool concept where you would feed an impulse sample into a bank of parallel bandpass filters (very narrow q- which is also constructed with delay lines fundamentally). The idea is feedback and resonance from the filters would emulate acoustic modes. \n\nYou can emulate this with fairly cheap stuff like leap motion, I\u2019ve done a different project (something much simpler) with leap motion for gesture controlled music concr\u00e8te.

Which I like the idea of getting the piece you know you want or need first and then playing the rest of the time. Or how to communicate and prevent really good players from over powering a song and doing too much? For this project I chose to leave a lot of room for the players to play and write their own parts, but I also needed to reel them in a little bit and simplify what was happening. Even then when I dug through the tracks I had to mute certain fills, take a simpler pass of the keys to let the bass do it\u2019s thing or vice versa. This also makes me consider the question: when do you let a song suggest to you when something special needs to happen?",

The last project I worked on before the one I mentioned just above was with an artist who had no vision and deferred to me on almost every choice. My \u2018demo\u2019 for the most part became the record with very little outside collaboration not necessarily by my choice but by outside constraints from the artist (I.e. budget and time). I will say the song turned out killer and we both were happy with it but certain avenues were for sure closed along the way that maybe would have served the song more. The project I mentioned in the initial post here was flipped. The artist has a vision and wants to co-produce the record and the \u2018demo\u2019 was the most naked version of the song. I think now the contrast of those two projects is why I\u2019m ruminating on all this \ud83e\uddd0",

Have been wanting to do same (master just one synth) for a while, but a lot of times I just need a wild card and go flipping through Reaktor stuff with sexy results. Shame about the CPU load/PT instability, it can sound bloody great.\n\nI considered Massive X as my numero uno, but similarly it just feels too heavy on load and once a session starts getting crowded.\n\nWondered if it\u2019d be a move to just go gung ho on Ableton\u2019s Operator, but it rarely sounds that inspiring to me. I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s probably my driving, but I need things to sound good straight away/v easily or the moment gets lost.\n\nAnyone else got any contenders for the role?",

Basically you are able to shift the fundamental of the sound without changing the tambre of the sample. EQ is just to visualise the fundamental moving. I have the same obsession with some tracks and can usually do it by ear now. If you are able to sing somewhat in pitch, try and sing the percussion sound, and find a note on the piano that matches it. If you get the technique down, I find it is the fastest way to do it. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "content": "Totally. \n\nSo I should clarify a little bit. These 3-4 patches aren't static sounds that I never change. Think of them more like initialized synth templates with pre-determined routings and modulation that I can start with and then diverge from. I still use other people's presets, but using these templates can save me a good 15 minutes every time that I want to build a new patch and don't want to start all the way from scratch. They come with a lot of built-in expression.\n\nOn most of these I've got a lot of the keyboard tracking already tuned so that a bright patch doesn't get too harsh as I go up in register or it doesn't get too flabby and lose definition in the low-end.\n\nI've got one patch set up for very expressive pitch modulation. Lots of big sweeps and bends in the attack/release envelope phases. Think wonky Neptunes-type sounds or two-octave dive bombs. Stuff like that.\n\nOne patch is set for expressive filter and amplitude modulation. Wobbles, envelope modulations, and such. It's my go-to if I'm trying to play with some \"brassy\" dynamics.\n\nOne is a legato mono patch for very fluid vocal-like playing. A big emphasis on note articulation and variation. I think of it as a solo instrument.\n\nThe final one is (you called it) A nice poly synth. Think James Blake on a Prophet. Pretty standard stuff, but once again it's got keyboard tracking that's tuned up so that the patch feels rich across the entire range.",

    "content": "Playing it or you can take a drum loop with groove you like and map out a groove template. Playing it is much faster and more feel, but often times it will need editing unless you have great timing. If it\u2019s something loose then I\u2019d definitely go ahead and move each notes because quantizing even 50% is going to change the feel. This is real nerdy but when there\u2019s a really good moment in groove, I use logic\u2019s event editor to look at how many ticks they are off by and snap other notes to somewhere near. For example, if I liked the feel of it being 40 ticks late then I\u2019m gonna move everything (or some select notes that are in the same spot of the groove cycle) to somewhere nearby. Ticks are tempo relative so 50 ticks in 90bpm is different than 50 ticks in 120bpm. But it\u2019s still in same relative timeline, but it\u2019s going to feel different in different tempos. \n\nIf you want it to groove like a drummer played it, best thing to do is play it in. You might end up quantizing or fixing velocity to al 127 later, but it\u2019s going to be better than clicked in sequence if that is the style. Clicked in sequenced drums is its own groove too, you don\u2019t want them having looseness so you quantize them all to 0 but you can still mess around with nudging them to be a bit behind or ahead of the grid.",

First, it\u2019s insanely glitchy on my M1 computer which is funny since this is the version that\u2019s supposed to be compatible. Still running Pro Tools through Rosetta but Auto Tune will consistently freeze up my sessions to the point of me uninstalling it and going back to the previous version. So that made it unusable for me right off the bat. Second, for some reason, it has a mix knob. Even if I wanted to blend an octave down or some effected vocal with the dry, I\u2019d want the dry to be in tune. Not a natural dry vocal against a tuned octave down. Third, the default in AAX I remember was the craziest setting. I forget exactly what it was but I remember spending 20 minutes just trying to get it to tune and relearn where everything was. My last  biggest issue is that I\u2019m pretty sure Code Meter (Antares iLok substitute) kicks Dante in the balls every time it wants to check my license. This means late packets on my DVS and in extreme circumstances, drop outs. Autotune doesn\u2019t even have to be in the session for this to happen. This is a hard issue to prove so I\u2019m still a little unsure if I\u2019m right about this one but after uninstalling everything Antares, this problem went away.

    "content": "1) what are the top 5 most important things for you in purchasing a drum sample pack ?\n\n\nI never purchase drum sample packs - not since having Splice. I do like a clear identity in a pack though - for instance, The Kount's sample pack has all those lo-fi/saturated kicks and snares, wonky grooves and crusty hi hats etc that sit very much in his genre, so if I'm reaching for that sound, I know exactly where to go. \n\nI don't know your drummer or his band, but I'd wonder what distinctive character you could capture in your pack? So that I know exactly where to go when I want \"that\" sound in a writing session instant. \n\n\n2) I\u2019m always annoyed that all samples are 0.0db normalized and I always have to turned them way down to keep my gain staging coherent, would I be crazy to have them peak at -8 ? Would people automatically hate it ? \n\nI produce largely in Ableton now, and when you drop a sample in the drum rack, the instance of Simpler it creates defaults to -12dB. With the velocity:volume dial at default (45%), this causes a 0dB sample to play back at -6dB when velocity=100 (the default). My template has all mixer faders (including a basic drum rack + instance of Drum Buss) trimmed to -9dB (similar to my mix gain staging strategy I detailed previously), allowing me to mash stuff up if needed, and still have headroom to not have to max out vocals when it comes to cutting them. What I'm saying in a roundabout way is... I've already made allowances for 0dB samples, so I don't care - but you probably should, because if you're selling on Splice, they could sound dwarfed against the next pack.",

It\u2019s a funny one , I get defensive when people criticise some of the articulated viewpoints and experiences of artists like the ones I record . I know their life and it\u2019s struggles and realities , and often the people doing the criticising are imo often fully@morally corrupted and are receiving privileges they aren\u2019t even aware of that keeps them away from these realities , instead looking down sanctimoniously , projecting and misinterpreting (lol I\u2019ll wind my neck in now ) but also it frustrates me how unfortunately the image and language is perpetuated , given massive exposure and profited from by an industry that gives no fucks about the consequence on the community. Anyhoo . Life imitates art and vice versa and all that . At the end of the day I always think of it like this , if someone\u2019s on a mic saying what\u2019s on their mind or their heart that\u2019s a major positive and I thank music for this transformative power",

AI machine learning has so many other avenues that are easier to implement (with wider use cases and profit model) that going into this side of the audio won\u2019t be as lucrative of an investment of time.

I would love to not manually select the bouces folder I have created per project, as it's a lot of menu diving.. I can't seem to find a bounce location settings in preferences.. so figured I would ask the ableton wizards here. or is it best to just create a master bounces folder per EP or record and add to it as I go? kind of annoying if so, but I have learned enough workflow changes, I can adopt something like that.",

I hate having to edit and to be honest, nothing beats well played rhythm section\u2026 Especially because I do a lot of in between the groove stuff, 30% quantization can mess with the feel of well landed notes. So I\u2019m doing a lot of metronome practice these days",

If you want an ensemble sound plus some major grit and close-miking I *do* like the *Bernard Hermann* orchestral library from Spitfire.\n\nFor solo strings the *NI Cremona Quartet* instruments are really, really nice. They're a pleasure to play with and sound fantastic. These have maximum presence too, so you can get some very direct sounds with them. I'm really enjoying them. The articulation and tonal options are extremely thorough.\n\nA while back a few people recommended *Sunset Strings* by Realitone. While I haven't used it yet, they look very promising. They seem to be serving people who want a rock/pop string feel, which could be just the ticket.",

Leaves no strong impression, or the impression that the performance lacks intention.\n\nBand rocks (his guitar included), Harmonies and Gang Vocals are cool. \nReally the lead vocal is the only thing in the way of getting the song to be really good. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel like his intuition for the release date (deadline is in 4 days) is good and could be very valuable for us.\nOn the other, I don't see why anyone would be truly excited for us if singer is mid.\n(I know he's good deep down, he's given me chills when singing with no pressure, rn we're just lacking some of that magic.)\n\nAs the song is today, you wouldn't love to listen to the song on your way to work or school, enjoying it for what it is.\n\nAnyway, right now I'm going to try and squeeze that magic out of him in the next following days when we can see each other.\nAs I'm typing this I also realize I should send him the instrumental and let him try shit alone. \n\nMaybe that's my answer.",

Like where they NEED to try out every idea they have, even if it's not good, or if it's a bad time (ie we're tracking guitars and they stop everyone to try out a (bad) bass idea). \n\nI'm on a project right now where a new artist is bringing their songwriting partner to every session as a producer. This is their first production gig (which is fine), but we're wasting a lot of time on ideas that get scrapped later on. This person has a good ear, and occasionally has GREAT ideas, but it takes forever for them to let go of bad ideas. \n\nIt takes all of my patience to very slowly walk them through why the ideas aren't working, and there's a lot of pushback when I do. A lot of \"but can we just try it? I really feel like it will work\" then 3 hours later \"oh yeah I think you were right let's delete it\".",

We've had to retrack vocals for nearly every song because the performance just isn't quite there yet, but we always get it where we want it in the second session. I'm noticing a pattern of him sitting with the vocal and realizing he wants to sing it differently/better, but only feels this after we've tracked it once. Today was day 1 tracking vocals on a new song and it got to the point where i realized we were going to have to try again another day, I was felt fed up. I tried to discern what exactly i was frustrated at. Part of me was frustrated because it doesnt seem like he is ever truly prepared to track vocals, in the sense of being warmed up, having ideas of how he wants to sing, practicing ahead of time, singing random stuff in between takes, etc. The other part of me was frustrated with myself because im aware some of the responsibility falls on me as the producer/coach. I have no problem taking time to edit the vocal, i know it's part of the job, i enjoy it in fact haha - but is it fair to have certain expectations from him as the artist? I want to have a conversation with him about it but also be clear that i want to be better at my job too",

I have a question\u2014 when setting up to record vocals, what levels do you generally let the volume peak at, and how does one work with dynamic performances? And a specific question: what should I keep the gain at on my interface?\n\nThis recent project has a very whisper-like vocal section that requires a little more gain, and then a lot of loud vocals that require less gain. \n\nThis ends up leaving me having to either turn up the clip gain during mixing or turning up the bus, which leads to clipping. Or (something I really don\u2019t like, because I tend to hear it a lot more) is adjusting the gain while tracking sections. There\u2019s certainly a way to navigate this seamlessly, but I just don\u2019t know it yet :stare:",

But I think we can dig a bit deeper.\n\nI like to work in a way during tracking/production that\u2019s maybe a bit more old school with shooting for around -18dbFS on the average. It gives me a kind of fixed reference in my mind which gives me enough headroom for most dynamics. Now the important part is you have to turn up your monitoring/headphones volume to be adequately loud to work with those lower levels and then leave it there.That being said it might be necessary to bring down other pre existing tracks that are too loud.\n\nNow since the volume of the monitoring/headphones stays the same during that tracking session you can use the gain of your preamp (or the output gain of the compressor, if you\u2019re using one on the way in) to adjust the vocal or instrument so that for every part of the arrangement it feels right. So in a sense you are pre mixing during the recording, taking off some work down the line",

I'm still learning and un-learning good habits and bad habits, and developing skills as to what's right and wrong when it comes to producing and mixing. But I think something I'm struggling with right now is knowing whether or not the production process was not good or the mix process was not good, based on the sound of the final product.\n\nI've really dove deep into learning how to mix in the last two years and definitely improved, but in terms of production, I think I'm still quite intimidated by what the first go-round sounds like and get frustrated. Covid times showed me that getting really good sound is possible in the comfort of your own space, and it was reassuring. But then at the end of a project, I'm like \"Well, I've done everything they did, why doesn't mine sound like that?\" (Comparison is the thief of joy, I know :sadcowboy: ). And I'm left wondering, is it my gear, is it my space, is it my interface, is it my DAW, is it my mix, is it my master?\n\nAnd then this begs my other question, even if they production was not necessarily \"A tier\", just how much can mixing fix it?\n\nI think I'm just curious as to what I can do to optimize my production process as much as possible, mixing aside, so that way I at least know that it's not something from the tracking process I need to go back fix.",

Accessing those is easy.\nThe problem is I don't make preset kits. Every session, every kit, is a different combination of things, always starting fresh. So I am in the Library view constantly going through samples/files to load into any Cell of Battery.\n\nWhen I find a sound I like, I can click it or drag it to the cell I want. This is all great.\n\nBut, the second i drop it in, I have to change the velocity from 0-100% (I saved my default preset to have all cells at 0% velocity which seems to be working). and then *every time i add a new sample or replace a sample* it makes it a loop in the \"Editor\" window. There is no shortcut, no preference, no saving a preset, that allows me to essentially remove that behavior.",
