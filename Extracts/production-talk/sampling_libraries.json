    "content": "By far, the most important element in realistic orchestral sound is in the programming. You need a controller where you can automate cc1 and cc11 (modulation and expression). Instruments, especially strings, are constantly changing their volumes. Particularly on entrances and phrase-ends. If you don't have a controller for this, you can draw it all in, but that gets really tedious.\n\nIf you get that figured out, I can almost guarantee that just about any library out there will get you good results. So then it's just a matter of what sound do you gravitate towards, how elaborate of a feature set do you need, etc. Legatos are overrated and I'd take no legato over a poorly programmed one any day.\n\nIf you want a full orchestra, not just strings, I'd check out some of the all-in-one offerings from Spitfire (Albion, BBC Orchestra, or Abbey Road), East West, Orchestral Tools (Inspire), or VSL (Prime). They all will have several different articulations, a decent amount of dynamic layers, and a full set of orchestral instruments. Have a listen to them and see what sounds grab you. Spitfire and Orchestral Tools have a more prominent room sound baked in, but they all do to some extent. So be aware that, whichever library you choose, there's a certain amount of \"reverb\" (which is actually just the hall they're recorded in) that you will never be able to turn off.",

For starters:\n\n1. Include a radio tuner. \n2. Maybe some really nice - but heavily colored - preamps.\n3. Include all kinds of weird peripheral sensors like devices that pick up EMF signals or a few contact mics. Include a suite of effect plugins that are specially geared towards these input methods.\n4. Super-intuitive resampling, time-stretching, and pitch-shifting features.\n5. An algorithm that analyzes the dominant pitch of a loop and auto-maps it to a keyboard. It should be capable of re-orienting itself as the dominant pitch of a loop is adjusted.\n6. Tracker-style sequencing capabilities.\n7. An OTT-style compressor. Maybe something really trashy and blown-out like Devil-Loc or Vulf Compressor. Something that really messes with the proportions of a sample.\n8. Easy and flexible integration of feedback loops.\n9. Intuitive integration of polyrhythmic looping or sequencing.\n10. A feature for easy implementation of Steve Reich 'It's Gonna Rain' style tape loop phasing.\n11. Auto-bpm detection keyed off of designated inputs (ala Ableton).\n12. Automated master tempo effects.\n\nI could go on.",

    "content": "Test is done. Tl;dr they don't null completely. They don't even detect the same audio the same.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\nBeckley, et al. (2023) reported differences in tuning results between the plugin and standalone versions of Melodyne. This investigator undertook a test of Melodyne plugin, ARA and standalone versions to determine whether the resulting tuned audio would null.\n\n**METHODS**\n\nAll testing was performed at a sample rate of 48kHz and with .wav files at a bit depth of 32 bits. Tuning was tested using two 2-second square wave tones generated with FabFilter One in Logic Pro X. Tone #1 was generated at a constant pitch of C4 +50ct. Tone #2 was generated at a pitch of C4 with the following settings: Modulation Generator (MG) Frequency set to 4.033 Hz,  MG waveform set to value 0.500, and Frequency Modulation MG set to value 0.123. Each tone was printed on a separate channel as a Bounce-in-place (bip). The two bips were then joined into a single, 6-second, mono .wav file with 2 seconds of silence between the bips. The 6-second .wav file was copied onto two new channels in Logic Pro X, and dragged out of Logic Pro onto the desktop for use in Melodyne standalone.\n\nAudio was transferred into Melodyne: one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne non-ARA, one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne ARA, and the copy of the .wav file on the desktop was loaded into Melodyne standalone. All transfers were completed using the Melodic (Standard) algorithm. \n\nTransferred audio was quantized to pitch C4, offset 0 ct, Pitch Modulation 0.0%, Pitch Drift 0.0%. All other settings were left at defaults; Note Assignment mode was checked to verify that Playback Type in each case was 'Tonal'. \n\nResulting audio was printed and imported into three new mono channels in Logic Pro X. Null testing was performed using the phase invert feature in Logic Pro X's stock 'Gain' plugin.",

I think it comes down to 2 things for me. \n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n\n1) Choosing Sounds. \n\nIn addition to vibe & genre & emotional intent, each instrument or sample that you pick covers a certain area of the overall picture. Knowing where that part is going to go in the overall arrangement changes how much hi end or low end or wetness (etc.) you want. It also steers performances. \n\n2) Actually Mixing As You Go \n\nOnce a part is recorded, do a quick adjustment so that you hear closer to a finished product. This helps you make better choices about what else needs to be added, (or not added,) and will likely inspire the next step.",

Would people automatically hate it ? \n3) In acoustic drum packs, how interested would you be about having the mixed loop but always the stems from that loop (separate mics, or at least kick, snare, kit etc\u2026)\n4) how important is it for there to be pre-made battery/drum rack/kontakt instruments of the library or are straight wav files cool ?\n5) what is the sample rate standard for sample librairies ?",

It's perfectly capable of making great drums.\n\nA pre-made drum loop will usually be more polished and ready-to-go than making your own drum pattern from individual samples. The pre-made loop will likely have been EQ'd, compressed, and mixed to work harmoniously, whereas if you're building a loop from scratch using samples it is up to you to polish and sculpt the sounds so that they work well together.\n\nIf the pre-made drum loop is like having someone serve you a finished meal, building the drum part from scratch means you have to learn to \"cook\" using those ingredients. It'll be harder to do well at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll be able to be more expressive.",

    "content": "I feel you, especially in boom bap there's a lot that goes into that drunken swing feel. Same with tradition African groove. Easiest way is to load up a clip or loop from a drummer you like and extracting groove templates. You can quantize to the groove of your favorite drummer or a drum loop you dig. This will get you the results, but groove is a never ending journey of learning. Editing groove to make it feel the way you want to feel takes an understanding of what makes things groove one way or the other. It can be accents, dynamics, lengths of the notes, how much you deviate from the grid or what subdivisions you're on, and how the timing offsets rub and interact with each other in the whole instrumentation. Some drummers have really solid quintuplet swing, so instead of doing tripplet swing they'll play on the downbeat and the 3rd or 4th note of quintuplet. For this you can listen to guys like Nate Smith, he plays swings differently live than recordings- he drags and pushes the kicks and snares in recordings but for live, he only swings hats so there's more steady groove for other musicians to grab onto. \n\nOn the other hand, for playing the grooves yourself- I find it helpful to dance and groove to the rhythms as much as I can to absorb the feel and internalize them. But in order to play ahead or behind with authority, you need to know where the grids are and metronome practice is crucial. I'm not that great at timing either, so I'm trying to do as much reps in with metronomes as I can. Learning to play on the grid is a first step before learning how to deviate with clear intention. I hope this helps!",

Picking up on the midi ticks convo last week, if youre programming in Logic , instead of dragging (and losing track of your moves) in the timeline/piano roll....throw one of these on an insert and increase the delay in tiny increments as you run down the track (typically hats and offbeat/ghost snares first) . You can quickly create the pocket youre looking for . Also added bonus...I believe under c. 12ms most people arent hearing a glaring time shift , (i dont go above 2ms ) so the delay is handy again just putting your hats , snares, percussive elements....just a millisecond or two behind/in front of each other so all your transient sounds are not hitting the 1/4,1/8, 16th counts at precisely the same instant. I find this helps with transients. Lastly, unlink the left and right on a stereo channel and youve got an instant width tool. Best for the transient and groove use tho imo.",

If I'm using a loop it's because I want a vibe to happen instantly. Any edits I make on the loop will have to be done across the mics anyway, and hopefully you'll have mixed the loop in such a way that rocks the intention of the part being played. I can see instances where having control over close mics / overheads/ rooms might be cool though.\n\n\n4) how important is it for there to be pre-made battery/drum rack/kontakt instruments of the library or are straight wav files cool ?\n\nWould definitely like this.\n\n\n\n5) what is the sample rate standard for sample librairies ?\n\n\nDunno, but I'd like to see 24/44 or 48, and I can't imagine why you'd go below this.",

They have almost 150-160 GB's of free Library of Pre Recorded sound which are royalty free which has almost everything  you'll need.\n2. Download Soundly(it's Free) and Use it as your Sample Browser for faster workflow as it's search functionality is specifically designed for searching foley sound,sfx,ambience etc(make Sure to Run it as Administrator for windows or it won't drag sounds to ableton) .\n3. Run Ableton in Gridless Mode for perfect timings for placing foley.\n4. Make sure to level and organise similer sounds together on the Go as it will help in later stages for sending stems for mixing.\n5. Going Scene by scene helps for preventing the overwhelm of the Huge Film.\nand all the Best for this Gig\ud83c\udf7b",

It also brings up a HUGE philosophy consideration that most musicians are uncomfortable wrestling with....\n\n\nCraft vs Art.  You can be a music craftsman that has huge success and have never made personal artistic output. Art doesn't equal market value and market value doesn't rank art. \n\nMaking with Splice can be rewarding and make a craft product of market value....  and it might even be transformative and unique enough to be art...  but it could just as easily be basic craft work without any intrinsic artistic value or personal expression.  It's a wide gradient of subjective value judgements.",

I haven't used BBCSO, but I know it's light on variations in exchange for having a full set of orchestral instruments and articulations at a budget price. Any of Spitfire's main libraries would be fine, or Cinematic Studio Strings, Orchestral Tools.. pretty much anything should do the job as long as it has enough round robins and hopefully at least 4 dynamic layers.",

    "content": "As others have said, recreating a beat you like is the school you need to go to. One of my favorite beats of all time is Fleetwood Mac's \"Hypnotized\" which is a swingy, triplet unchanging thing that is effectively a drum loop through the song, except Mick Fleetwood plays it. I recreated it using a sample pack of Mick Fleetwood's and turned it into a song after serious finagling, especially in the context of grid music. The insight into accent, velocity, swing, where in the grid things hit (or don't), which specific hits matter and how dropping just one or two key hits in a repetitive pattern can shift the groove entirely. It also tests your chops for figuring out choke groups, how to make closed and open hi hats sound \"real\" (if that's your goal) so on and so forth. I also love recreating a beat as a way in when musical inspiration may be lacking.",

Or both? \n\n2. I think the equivalent syncing feature in Dropbox would be \"make available offline\". If you right click a folder and \"make available offline\" it will continually update when it receives uploads from the other computer. Have you used that before? It doesn't have the lightning speed of a local network/ethernet connection, but if you can wait a few minutes it's good.\n\n3. I assume these are Ableton sessions. Do you ever use the 'collect all and save' feature when saving sessions? It will gather every external sample (but not sampled instrument libraries) and save them to the project folder, which will save you the trouble of having to point your Ableton session to any external directory, because it will all be in the project folder. Very good when it comes to archiving sessions and opening them up years later.",

Elements which if muted would leave you feeling like something is missing but you can\u2019t necessarily make them out when in. \n\nI guess this could be anything from a few percussion loops (maybe panned/verb with no pre-delay or less high end to place them at the back of the mix) to a subtle vocal or foley sample playing one note throughout the groove. \n\nLayering to me is part of this but my intent with it is usually to create a sound or get more out of an element (like layering the attack of a snap with a clap for a different transient / texture). But this doesn\u2019t always add to \u201cfullness\u201d in my mind. It just makes one element better or more interesting. \n\nMaybe start with the loops and foley.

A lot of physical modeling is heavily based on delay lines, so I\u2019d start there. Modal synthesis is also another cool concept where you would feed an impulse sample into a bank of parallel bandpass filters (very narrow q- which is also constructed with delay lines fundamentally). The idea is feedback and resonance from the filters would emulate acoustic modes. \n\nYou can emulate this with fairly cheap stuff like leap motion, I\u2019ve done a different project (something much simpler) with leap motion for gesture controlled music concr\u00e8te. But you can definitely use the gestures to do the same thing with physical modeling. I\u2019d be down to work on something together if you\u2019re interested!",

So you may need to resample to kill sustains - or not if you want it to have lengthiness. If you are going for SOPHIE kind of sound then you'd probably keep the feedback. \n\nBooms (filter resonance) are similar mechanisms but less tonal unless you turn up the feedback a lot more - it will certainly be more natural sounding as opposed to comb-filtery sound. \n\nLayering will give more focused pitch while maintaining the integrity of the layered sample sound, you would probably have the most control this way. \n\nVocoder will have inherently baked sound because of the synthesis mechanism, it can be desirable or not depending on the scenario. \n\nWith sampler looping, you will get grainier tail - dialing in the decay is necessary if you want the sound to be percussive because it will just continue sustaining.

Playing it is much faster and more feel, but often times it will need editing unless you have great timing. If it\u2019s something loose then I\u2019d definitely go ahead and move each notes because quantizing even 50% is going to change the feel. This is real nerdy but when there\u2019s a really good moment in groove, I use logic\u2019s event editor to look at how many ticks they are off by and snap other notes to somewhere near. For example, if I liked the feel of it being 40 ticks late then I\u2019m gonna move everything (or some select notes that are in the same spot of the groove cycle) to somewhere nearby. Ticks are tempo relative so 50 ticks in 90bpm is different than 50 ticks in 120bpm. But it\u2019s still in same relative timeline, but it\u2019s going to feel different in different tempos. \n\nIf you want it to groove like a drummer played it, best thing to do is play it in. You might end up quantizing or fixing velocity to al 127 later, but it\u2019s going to be better than clicked in sequence if that is the style. Clicked in sequenced drums is its own groove too, you don\u2019t want them having looseness so you quantize them all to 0 but you can still mess around with nudging them to be a bit behind or ahead of the grid.",

Administered time stretching (both lengthened and shortened) via the time tool. Also administered pitch shifting via pitch tool and checked detection of tuning via correct pitch macro. After exporting these, they were reimported to see if detection had changed.\n\nObjective Results:\n-Upon import, vocal tempo detection was different. (One detected in 5/4, the other in 3/4, at drastically different tempos).\n-For short notes, when using the time tool to stretch, there were audible differences in results.\n-For long notes, when using the time tool to shorten, there was significantly less audible difference (subjectively: no difference)\n-For pitch detection, the algorithm detected pitch differently both audibly and visually.\n\nSubjective Opinions:\n-Time stretching yielded reduced artifacts in extreme settings when done at 192kHz. It did not eliminate all artifacts, but did reduce them.\n-When time stretching in a more nuanced way, the differences in artifacts were negligible.\n-When adjusting pitch manually, there was no audible difference in the quality of the pitch shifting at different sample rates. (For this test, everything was shifted up half an octave before any adjustments made)\n-When detecting pitch, both behaved quite differently. This was partially due to detection of select blobs being different at either sample rate. (This was most surprising to me of all the results)\n-When blobs were adjusted to match as closely as possible by hand, the tuning seemed to behave identically, including locations and levels of artifacts. (My gut says they \u201cfelt\u201d different but that is most likely either placebo or the slight differences in true blob locations)",

So that I know exactly where to go when I want \"that\" sound in a writing session instant. \n\n\n2) I\u2019m always annoyed that all samples are 0.0db normalized and I always have to turned them way down to keep my gain staging coherent, would I be crazy to have them peak at -8 ? Would people automatically hate it ? \n\nI produce largely in Ableton now, and when you drop a sample in the drum rack, the instance of Simpler it creates defaults to -12dB. With the velocity:volume dial at default (45%), this causes a 0dB sample to play back at -6dB when velocity=100 (the default). My template has all mixer faders (including a basic drum rack + instance of Drum Buss) trimmed to -9dB (similar to my mix gain staging strategy I detailed previously), allowing me to mash stuff up if needed, and still have headroom to not have to max out vocals when it comes to cutting them. What I'm saying in a roundabout way is... I've already made allowances for 0dB samples, so I don't care - but you probably should, because if you're selling on Splice, they could sound dwarfed against the next pack.",

If the range knob is at 50% and shift is at 0 and you play C0 it will use the sample from G0 (because it\u2019s 50% the distance from C0) and if you play C2 it will use the sample from G1 - also has interesting effects on the sound.

My reasons were much like yours; to get away from software and have a standalone instrument to play with.\n\nI don't have many bad things to say about it, but ultimately it just wasn't a good fit for the way my brain works. NI have crammed a tremendous amount of features and functions into that thing. Most of which it does very well, but when it came time to do sequencing in the unit the interface was just too much of a hurdle for me. I found it hard to keep all of the key commands in my head to do simple commands. I think it's a little *too* efficient in how many options they've fit into it. Remembering the commands among it's unorthodox button layout was challenging and unintuitive for me.\n\nAs you might imagine, it integrates perfectly with the Maschine software, which is basically a DAW within a plugin that controls the hardware and vice-versa if you choose to use a computer. But I wasn't interested in that, because I can achieve the same things and more with plain old Ableton.\n\nIt *does* have a fantastic sample library and the NI sample packs you can purchase are very well done.",

If you want an ensemble sound plus some major grit and close-miking I *do* like the *Bernard Hermann* orchestral library from Spitfire.\n\nFor solo strings the *NI Cremona Quartet* instruments are really, really nice. They're a pleasure to play with and sound fantastic. These have maximum presence too, so you can get some very direct sounds with them. I'm really enjoying them. The articulation and tonal options are extremely thorough.\n\nA while back a few people recommended *Sunset Strings* by Realitone. While I haven't used it yet, they look very promising. They seem to be serving people who want a rock/pop string feel, which could be just the ticket.",

So I am in the Library view constantly going through samples/files to load into any Cell of Battery.\n\nWhen I find a sound I like, I can click it or drag it to the cell I want. This is all great.\n\nBut, the second i drop it in, I have to change the velocity from 0-100% (I saved my default preset to have all cells at 0% velocity which seems to be working). and then *every time i add a new sample or replace a sample* it makes it a loop in the \"Editor\" window. There is no shortcut, no preference, no saving a preset, that allows me to essentially remove that behavior.",
