    "content": "This made me think of a production technique Ive stumbled on.  We all have our go to instincts that can lead to a similar feeling across a  record.  Generally there is a dominant instrument that the song was written on such as guitar or piano maybe a synth.  Take a filled out productions and mute all the main ingredients and leave the additive colors, only the sprinkles on top. And start rebuilding the production around that. It can take you to an entirely different  universe and provide contrast in the arch of the record",

Not sure what kind of music you're making but for my workflow I like doing whatever I feel on a production and then having quick \"modern\" drum sounds I can reach for that immediately can put things into the present.\n\nI'm doing a production right now for a UK artist where they gave me a throwback sounding demo, but I know the artist is a young 2023 female pop star. So I did a bunch of organic shit (acoustic through my 67, some live claps, shit like that), then I threw some kshmr and oliver loops in to just see what the hybrid of classic and modern sounds like. Production is basically done now",

Include all kinds of weird peripheral sensors like devices that pick up EMF signals or a few contact mics. Include a suite of effect plugins that are specially geared towards these input methods.\n4. Super-intuitive resampling, time-stretching, and pitch-shifting features.\n5. An algorithm that analyzes the dominant pitch of a loop and auto-maps it to a keyboard. It should be capable of re-orienting itself as the dominant pitch of a loop is adjusted.\n6. Tracker-style sequencing capabilities.\n7. An OTT-style compressor. Maybe something really trashy and blown-out like Devil-Loc or Vulf Compressor. Something that really messes with the proportions of a sample.\n8. Easy and flexible integration of feedback loops.\n9. Intuitive integration of polyrhythmic looping or sequencing.\n10. A feature for easy implementation of Steve Reich 'It's Gonna Rain' style tape loop phasing.\n11. Auto-bpm detection keyed off of designated inputs (ala Ableton).\n12. Automated master tempo effects.\n\nI could go on.",

Whether it's a drum fill, or a chord voicing that walks up/down into the next section, or tension in the melodic voices, or shortening the notes lengths (staccato, staccatissimo).\n\nThere's also idiomatic noises from the instruments. Guitars have string scrapes, headstock rakes, that cool chattering thing from tapping near the bridge with the edge of your pick. Pianos have big glisses, horns can squeal, bowed strings can sweep a fast legato scale up into the downbeat or do a large gliss.\n\nThen there's foley. I get a *lot* of mileage from sound libraries made for film audio. Foley artists are some creative people and you can go far layering their sounds into instruments at the transitions.",

    "content": "I will say this, on the topic of standing up for yourself -- I've seen a couple times in these threads now a general sentiment of accepting that people are gonna kick you around. It felt evident when we were riffing on sliding scale mixing rates last month and it felt evident this morning/last night in here. I'm all in on the greyhound sentiment, I've been a grafter through and through since I was in elementary school skipping homework to double up on piano practice. I once drove 7 hours to buy a Juno-60 on Craigslist and the guy didn't answer the door; I make DUMB life decisions all centered around this non-negotiable gravity towards the art. I can promise I have whatever that obsessive brain disorder thing is that we all keep riffing about (and believe the same for the grand majority here). But can we not practice a little self preservation along the way? Nobody besides your team is really gonna stick up for you; I believe that in line with the all the professional metrics there exists the opportunity/need to set  precedents on how you want to be treated. I don't think this is something that *comes* with being a great producer, I think it's something that *contributes* to someone becoming a great producer. And of course, knowing how to ask for that fairness with a kind/patient/assertive/flexible tone is critical. But if I believe something is a little crooked in the system, I'd rather not wait till I hopefully arrive a decade later on the other side of the fence to be able to do something about it. I would rather make an attempt at being heard now and see whether it makes any progress, even if it just gives some suit on an email thread something to think about. It's not for the sake of my own ego, it's for the sake of our entire breed.",

    "content": "Wanted to share some thoughts spurred on by a recent experience on here. So a local artist has hired me to produce two of her songs. Vibe is singer-songwriter, soul, RnB.\n\nWe tracked drums, bass, and keys live in the studio OD'd to scratch tracks we cooked up together. The scratch tracks / demos were just guitar vocal and we were really relying on the players to fill out the arrangements, but we knew more would be added down the line.\n\nAll the players were incredible. Could singe your eyebrows off with technical prowess and shredtastic chops. Tracks turned out great, still working on the arrangement, but..\n\nThis project has got me thinking more about the importance of how you present a song to session musicians and the 'space' you ask them to fill in a production. As well as the changing dynamics project to project affected by a revolving cast of participants, more fleshed out demos, etc... I find this a really interesting topic. Curious if anyone in the group has any unique experiences or insights whether as a producer or a musician.\n\nI've found that the more I flesh out demos with the artist beforehand the more bound and limited the session players we bring in are based off our decisions. This can make ODs more efficient, add a clearer direction, but can also remove the opportunity for the player to really add something special. Sometimes I don't want to be too suggestive b/c I want the players to have more of a blank canvas to work with.",

    "content": "One thing I love to do to help me wrap my head around sounds and tools is basically \u201ctranscribing\u201d a preset to a new initialized patch on the same synth. Keep hitting the keys as you go to see how copying each setting changes the sound, and see if the end result is the same when you think you\u2019re done. Often you\u2019ll be completely missing some modulator somewhere and you\u2019ll really need to dig through the synth\u2019s features to find something you didn\u2019t know before. As a bonus, you can try the same thing but have the synth that the preset comes from and the synth you\u2019re recreating it in be two different tools, like trying to remake you\u2019re favorite serum patch in Pigments. Sometimes certain features will be missing outright and you\u2019ll just have to use your ears to get close, but I find this really useful for figuring the inherent differences in the tools at my disposal. Best thing about both of these exercises is they only take about 10-15 minutes a patch, then you\u2019re on to something new",

But remember YOU are the one who holds the keys to the execution of the artist's ideas. You can have ideas and try them yourself, but if the artist has ideas, it's still YOU that has to execute them (because presumably they're not a producer like you). \n\nSo you're actually building a big creative trust by helping the artist try stuff. If you can execute ideas that the artist can't quite articulate or do themselves, you gain a credibility where you can both listen and then say \"Ah, I see what you mean.

The original Massive had a lot of aliasing that could make it sound hazy and flat. Switching over to Massive X it is crystal clear and even buzzy saw waves feel warm, pure, and tactile.\n\nIt has extremely flexible modulation capabilities that I find to be very musical as well as some very comprehensive ADSHR envelopes. It also has four different keyboard tracking curves that you can assign and tweak, which is very important when fine-tuning your patch to make sure that it sounds even across the entire range of keys.\n\nIt has a lot of musical sounding filters that can inject a ton of vibe, or be completely neutral. The *noise* section is robust and very flexible. I use it a lot.\n\nFinally, it has a great-sounding set of internal effects (delay, chorus, saturation, verb, etc) that can be placed anywhere inside of the routing diagram. It's always a bummer when the on-board effects aren't very inspiring. But NI has a strong catalog of well-designed dsp to draw on and integrate into their products, so it's turned out great.\n\nOverall, it's a very robust and well-rounded synthesizer that also does a lot of things extremely well. It can be super clean (like Serum) but also get very dirty, which I appreciate in a synth.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that the preset browser kind of sucks. I prefer the original Massive's browser. NI is well aware and they have been overhauling it and slowly adding new features, so I trust in time this will be made better.",

    "content": "Logic Gang: quick share, Im finding the sample delay tool v useful in a few ways and reccommend for a few reasons. Picking up on the midi ticks convo last week, if youre programming in Logic , instead of dragging (and losing track of your moves) in the timeline/piano roll....throw one of these on an insert and increase the delay in tiny increments as you run down the track (typically hats and offbeat/ghost snares first) . You can quickly create the pocket youre looking for . Also added bonus...I believe under c. 12ms most people arent hearing a glaring time shift , (i dont go above 2ms ) so the delay is handy again just putting your hats , snares, percussive elements....just a millisecond or two behind/in front of each other so all your transient sounds are not hitting the 1/4,1/8, 16th counts at precisely the same instant. I find this helps with transients. Lastly, unlink the left and right on a stereo channel and youve got an instant width tool. Best for the transient and groove use tho imo.",

The better keyboard is worth it alone, because the Sub37 keys felt a bit thick and slow.",

I\u2019m not a guitarist but I was playing around last night with keyboard sounds and full mixes and it was very inspiring.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that $400 is a lot for one pedal.  Factor in another $60 for their midibox if you want to have it connected via midi.  They do have CC control of every feature on the pedal including the hidden ones and an Ableton Max4Live plugin that allows you to recall settings and automate parameters.",

They have almost 150-160 GB's of free Library of Pre Recorded sound which are royalty free which has almost everything  you'll need.\n2. Download Soundly(it's Free) and Use it as your Sample Browser for faster workflow as it's search functionality is specifically designed for searching foley sound,sfx,ambience etc(make Sure to Run it as Administrator for windows or it won't drag sounds to ableton) .\n3. Run Ableton in Gridless Mode for perfect timings for placing foley.\n4. Make sure to level and organise similer sounds together on the Go as it will help in later stages for sending stems for mixing.\n5. Going Scene by scene helps for preventing the overwhelm of the Huge Film.\nand all the Best for this Gig\ud83c\udf7b",

A lot of tech these days enables that ease and has opened the door to more people writing and producing their records.\n\nBut a secondary side-effect that I think we can all observe - and I think this is more to your point - is that musicians are leaning into those methods and not pursuing the hard work and practice that is necessary to do things like singing well, or playing piano with more than a base level of proficiency, or orchestrating an ensemble well. The expressive unlock of being highly proficient isn't being pursued like it was in the past decades (before we had so may technological means). People are - broadly speaking - more satisfied these days to settle for records that don't push into that potential.\n\nWhat we lose are the heights of expression that virtuosity unlocks. Whether that's singing like Aretha Franklin, or playing a simple ballad like Bill Evans, or writing a song with as much sophistication and lyrical wit as Joni Mitchell.",

Modeling these behaviors is a good way to start thinking musically with a synthesizer.\n\nSo if I'm going for a \"horn\" instrument I want a patch that can do attack-y stabs, but also fade into notes and have complete dynamic control. It should also have some sort of brightness feature that I can open up at will, like blowing harder into some brass.\n\nIf I'm emulating a voice there's going to be a big emphasis on legato playing and fluidity, with some very expressive pitch control for bends and vibrato. Maybe some form of subtle formant control to shade the notes like a singer would with different vowel sounds.\n\nAn organ patch is going to be a dead simple note-on/note-off volume envelope with the expression coming from the addition or subtraction of different oscillators.\n\nAnd some patches are just going to be gangly chaotic messes that you do your best to wrangle. Something with a lot of chaos and feedback and squealing. You can't control it, but you just strap in.",

It must be a decade old at this point, but Spectrasonics do a good job at supporting it. They're constantly patching it and a few months ago they added a fully-sampled felt piano instrument that sounds excellent.\n\nKontakt wouldn't be a bad investment either, since it's the backbone of NI's entire business model at this point, it comes with a sizeable sample library (not just piano), and new sample instruments are constantly being developed for the platform.",

Or both? \n\n2. I think the equivalent syncing feature in Dropbox would be \"make available offline\". If you right click a folder and \"make available offline\" it will continually update when it receives uploads from the other computer. Have you used that before? It doesn't have the lightning speed of a local network/ethernet connection, but if you can wait a few minutes it's good.\n\n3. I assume these are Ableton sessions. Do you ever use the 'collect all and save' feature when saving sessions? It will gather every external sample (but not sampled instrument libraries) and save them to the project folder, which will save you the trouble of having to point your Ableton session to any external directory, because it will all be in the project folder. Very good when it comes to archiving sessions and opening them up years later.",

Could go many diff directions.. how do we facilitate those \u2018special\u2019 moments with session players? Which I like the idea of getting the piece you know you want or need first and then playing the rest of the time. Or how to communicate and prevent really good players from over powering a song and doing too much? For this project I chose to leave a lot of room for the players to play and write their own parts, but I also needed to reel them in a little bit and simplify what was happening. Even then when I dug through the tracks I had to mute certain fills, take a simpler pass of the keys to let the bass do it\u2019s thing or vice versa. This also makes me consider the question: when do you let a song suggest to you when something special needs to happen?",

Basically you are able to shift the fundamental of the sound without changing the tambre of the sample. EQ is just to visualise the fundamental moving. I have the same obsession with some tracks and can usually do it by ear now. If you are able to sing somewhat in pitch, try and sing the percussion sound, and find a note on the piano that matches it. If you get the technique down, I find it is the fastest way to do it. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "content": "Totally. \n\nSo I should clarify a little bit. These 3-4 patches aren't static sounds that I never change. Think of them more like initialized synth templates with pre-determined routings and modulation that I can start with and then diverge from. I still use other people's presets, but using these templates can save me a good 15 minutes every time that I want to build a new patch and don't want to start all the way from scratch. They come with a lot of built-in expression.\n\nOn most of these I've got a lot of the keyboard tracking already tuned so that a bright patch doesn't get too harsh as I go up in register or it doesn't get too flabby and lose definition in the low-end.\n\nI've got one patch set up for very expressive pitch modulation. Lots of big sweeps and bends in the attack/release envelope phases. Think wonky Neptunes-type sounds or two-octave dive bombs. Stuff like that.\n\nOne patch is set for expressive filter and amplitude modulation. Wobbles, envelope modulations, and such. It's my go-to if I'm trying to play with some \"brassy\" dynamics.\n\nOne is a legato mono patch for very fluid vocal-like playing. A big emphasis on note articulation and variation. I think of it as a solo instrument.\n\nThe final one is (you called it) A nice poly synth. Think James Blake on a Prophet. Pretty standard stuff, but once again it's got keyboard tracking that's tuned up so that the patch feels rich across the entire range.",

The idea is that samples often have some boxiness or ringing that needs to be EQ'd out, but those problem-zones shift when the sample is transposed up and down, making any post-sampler EQ moves ineffectual.\n\nIf you could streamline the process of re-recording a static sample with the necessary EQ cuts committed into the one-shot then those cuts would be transposed along with the sample when you play it up and down the keyboard.",

I know how to play piano and strumming acoustic guitar a bit. I started to using a DAW in my 14s (FL Studio, yeah I know xD) and in the last 3 years I've been using Logic Pro and last months Pro Tools (just for editing and mixing).\n\nI love to produce electronic pop with a mix between synths and acoustic instruments. I want to be more versatile and confortable producing other genres (genres that I can produce just in my bedroom studio without having a great recording gear). \n\nI'm feeling stuck, I'm trying to listen different genres. I'm feeling very limited because I don't have a great background as a music player or student (my bsc is physics engineering). The music industry is tough and I want to be more confortable to work in other genres.\n\nI tried to be as brief as possible. What advice do you have for this situation? If I forgot to say something, I am free to respond. Thank you for your attention! Sorry about my english. \ud83d\ude42",

Roland has released MIDI 2.0 keyboards, and the new line of NI keyboards seems to have it (though it may not be fully implemented).\n\nI wonder when DAWs will start implementing it. I'm curious to know if having more CC resolution is going to make an appreciable difference in performance.",

I\u2019ve noticed I have a tendency to pan instruments a certain way, pianos sound better panned, electric guitars always feel better panned right, no reason why it just does.

But had it widen to over 80% in chorus. Then more narrow than I would normally have a doubled melodic at like 35%. Usually id just do one guitar, mono to scratch the scene change itch. I save hard panned left right area for chorus guitars or stereo stereo synths to swim in. That with dropping the piano for first half of verse 2 did the trick!
