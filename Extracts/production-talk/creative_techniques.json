I\u2019m talking actually nudging things around, not stretching. Then I\u2019ll consolidate and drop into Melodyne. In Melodyne I\u2019ll turn the whole thing and also really pay attention to the timing. At this stage it\u2019s a lot more stretching and/or compressing notes, or more importantly PARTS of words. Like I\u2019ll separate the consonant, and time compress that and bring up the volume so ccchhhhhhhhair becomes CHaaaaiiirrrr. (If that makes any sense). Then back into ProTools. Double check for any weirdness, comp back in the untuned bits you can get away with if you want. Then I\u2019ll do a final cleaning up of group Esses, do my little what I call Swedish time stretching technique, REALLY pocket and polish the vocals. Then I send it off to the label who needed it yesterday but somehow don\u2019t get back to me for 6 months.",

    "content": "Cian's advice is good. It's hard to know where to start, so I'll just share three \"a-ha!\" moments that I've had over the years where the reverb sound that I had been chasing was unlocked. Some of these may already be obvious to you:\n\n1. **Pre-Delay Time:** The longer your pre-delay time is the farther away the \"back wall\" of your mix will sound. 120ms pre-delays (which are huge) will give you that Bruce Swedien depth. The longer your pre-delay the less wet the verb will need to be. \n\nA short pre-delay time will \"glue\" the verb to your dry signal, while pre-delays longer than 50ms will \"detach\" from the dry sound and give you a greater sense of depth *and* clarity.\n\nExperiment with pre-delay times of 20 ms, 50ms, 80ms, and 120ms and see what happens. As you try these settings re-balance your verb with the dry/wet knob and see how that changes the feelings of depth, rhythm, and clarity in your mixes.\n\n2. **Panning/Width/Band-Limiting:** Most verbs default to full-width. Recognize that most verbs don't need to be this massive and practice narrowing your tails. The more that you narrow a reverb towards the center the more it will feel like it's extending into infinity towards the vanishing point of your mix.\n\nAdditionally, don't be afraid to focus your verb by rolling off the high-end and the low-end. Verbs contribute to a lot of clutter in a mix.\n\n3. **Slap Echo:** This was a big one for me. The reverb sound that I was hearing on so many of my favorite records (Bowie, Prince, etc) was really just a single band-limited echo blended to taste. Slap echoes tend to live in the 50ms - 100ms delay range. Sometimes that's all that's needed for the feeling of ambience I'm seeking and it takes up *way* less space in a mix.\n\nOnce you master that you can start blending your slap echo with your reverb tails and the combination will give you a very expansive sound with minimal fuss.",

It\u2019s Not Living if its Not With You is full of incredible vocal tricks. Worth repeated listenings. Youngblood by 5SOS is a modern song really well put together. Think Andrew Watt handled the vocals on that and did a fantastic job getting the take out of Luke. Dance Hall Days by Wang Chung is always a good reference. Mercy Street by Peter Gabriel (the whole SO record) pretty unfuckwithable. Bang Bang is always a great reference because you can really show a singer the difference between a Jessie J and an Arianna. Comes in handy in sessions a lot.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for creative, the whole Dissociatives record is a constant reference. I\u2019d start with \u201cHorror With Eyeballs\u201d",

In some ways our culture likes to reward artists being martyrs, but it\u2019s never something to strive for. I think as producers one of the biggest parts of our job is to be a grounding presence and a support for artists who can sometimes have pretty wild swings. But we\u2019re artists too in our own right with our own bipolar tendencies. In a way that can create an empathy bond between us\u2026we can understand the manic exuberance of making an amazing thing and how there\u2019s usually a pendulum swing in the other direction to compensate. But I kind of think our job as producers is to have our shit together enough to buffer that bipolar thing and make a sanctuary where an artist can feel at home. Just my random thought for the day.",

    "content": "So obviously starting with the right bass is going to get you 70% of the way there, but you know what *really* surprised the hell out of me? The *strings*. \n\nIf you're not getting anywhere close to the tone that you want, start exploring the wide world of bass strings. I had overlooked this simple thing for ages. I took my choice of strings for granted because I never had to change them. And when I did it made all of the difference in my tone.\n\nI've always been a Fender guy: P-basses and J-Basses, and the DI signal was always voiced way too dark to pop out of a mix without some heavy lifting. Granted I also use flatwounds (which aren't as zippy as roundwounds). \n\nAfter some research on the TalkBass forum, I ordered a few different sets of flats to experiment. One such set were the *Thomastik-Infeld Jazz Flats*, and ho-lee *shit*. There it was. There was the sound I was looking for.\n\nThey were voiced way lighter in the bass, which gave me a far more articulate midrange. Like the sound of an upright bass which (trust me) is a very good quality to have unless you're going for a grindy metal tone. As it turns out, the midrange is where *all* of the action is in the bass. It's okay if your bass DI is voiced with no low-end, because you can always add that weight back in, but if the midrange is not present to begin with it is an uphill battle to make it articulate in a mix.",

    "content": "<deep breath>\nSo, grasshopper, everything matters, and nothing matters. It depends on where you are and where you\u2019re going, and most importantly actually knowing where you\u2019re going.\n\nI view the difference in shitty gear vs good gear as compound interest. A vintech one on one might sound basically like a vintage neve. ALMOST indistinguishable. But if you\u2019re using it on all 149 of the tracks you\u2019re compiling into a pop song, the end result is going to be 149 times more noticeable. The second floor of the leaning tower of Pisa looks pretty spot on but the people on the 15th floor are freaking out. \n\nThat said, I could record a garbage singer through my 251 and my chain, and if I didn\u2019t know what to do with it, it would still be garbage. The flip side is we actually demoed different mics and different chains on Paris Hilton. There was a right answer. And she\u2019s not gonna win any singing contests, but at the end of the day the cumulative effect of all the decisions we made led to tracks that are still being played in clubs to make people dance over a decade later.\n\nDetails matter in not just what the audience hears eventually, but what the artist hears initially, giving them the confidence and headspace to sprinkle in their extra few (sometime more than a few) percentage points of vibe that the audience attaches too later. Fix it in the mix is an abused concept because it doesn\u2019t take in to account the affect of shitty sound or feel on the performance. You think 1 mic doesn\u2019t matter? I\u2019ve heard people sing noticeably more in tune and in time when switching from DAW monitoring to direct monitoring. It ALL matters.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t understand songs, melody, rhythm, and how these things interact to move people? None of it matters.",

Together they create a single melodic voice.\n\n**2) **How do the instruments stack on each other? Do they clash? Cellos doubling a bass an octave up extend it's timbre into a higher register to make it read better. It's not so different from adding fuzz to an 808 so that it has more presence.\n\n**3) **Which instrument will cut through the music?\n\n---\n\nA few concepts that I'll add:\n\n**4) **Instruments in the foreground vs. the background. Know which part is the lead (focal point) at any given point in the record and then pare down the presence of the rest and push it into the back of the sound stage.\n\n**5)** (Piggybacking off of Felix's excellent post) What is the simplest way to achieve the desired effect? Reduce. Reduce. Reduce.\n\nCut instruments and parts ruthlessly and approach it with a minimalist's eye. Like writing a haiku: How few elements can you use to create an impression? Maybe a guitar part is carrying 90% of the groove and the drums only need to be a kick and a snare. Or maybe the guitar is covering the backbeat too, and you don't even need a snare!\n\nConstantly ask yourself \"What is the most important sensation in the record?\" and then focus it by cutting out everything that gets in the way.\n\n**6)** Hocketing. Pass the melody off between different instruments at different points in the song. Play it in different registers. Combine voices occasionally for special effect.\n\n**7)** Tonal contrast. Dark instruments plus bright instruments. Distorted and clean together. Near vs. distant.\n\nElements that sound same-y will gel together and elements that contrast tonally will pop.",

When you actually get a bunch of great singers together to sing the same thing, their different timbres and slightly different pitches will add up to a very rich sound you can't get from stacking one tuned voice. That's what the effect called \"chorus\" is essentially trying to mimic with slight detune and delay.\n\nNot sure if this is a topic we've covered much but I know @BatMeckley and @Slow Hand have thoughts",

Doing what they did no longer felt quite so far out of reach.

It's all building on the foundations of what others have done before.\n\nIt opened my eyes to having a dialogue between myself and the rich history of music. Music is plastic, malleable, and fluid.

For intervals other than a 5th, it's not an octave below but some other pitch, and so yeah, you're likely creating unpleasant harmonics outside of the key.\n\nThe dumbest, but easiest way to avoid that is to let the bass be the inversion's lowest note while the plays a 5th from the root note. Otherwise, you're looking at dialing back the distortion on those inversions, or on the tone as a whole, which isn't necessarily what's desired.",

You need to line up your edits so the wave form is perfect in the middle of each note, then use an equal gain cross fade at the edit point. This gives you the most transparency because there is no algorithmic stretching happening. \n\nIt limits very slightly your options with timing because bass wave forms are long, so lining them up perfectly means you can only move the timing the length of each waveform. It's also time consuming compared to stretching.\n\nIf you are editing a DI that is then going through significant processing (amp sims and shit), you can sometimes get away with one of the stretching algorithms. Elastic audio is ok and usable sometimes, but I prefer Ableton's complex mode over everything else I've heard.\n\nI try to avoid time stretching artifacts on lead vocals and bass instruments more than anything else (unless it's creatively interesting of course).",

I'm making my way slowly through this Lanois/Beato interview and am amazed by what Lanois is describing from @ 52:24 to 53:45 regarding his approach to stacking modulations and special effects.\n\nAs he describes it, he's performing and printing his modulation effects (delay, verb, vibrato, pitch shifting, etc) one generation at a time as he iterates through the song. This allows him to fine-tune and perform the modulations on each successive pass so that every moment is honed and responsive enough that it becomes a part within the music, and not just a blanket effects chain.\n\nSo if he's doing pitch-shifted delays, he'll do a pass that goes up a fifth on certain notes and then layer another pass that modulates by a different interval at a select moment instead of leaving everything on throughout the entire section. He's honing each effect in sequence. It shows a tremendous care and sensitivity to the music that he would go through and *perform* each layer with so much intention.\n\nThis feels like a revelation to me and I can't wait to practice this.\n\n(I've cued up the video where they start talking about it)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxP9kKzbCFA&t=3144s",

And I was horrified cause my bass was sounding nowhere near as good and I knew the other player had the same type of bass.

Flex tune allows you to hit notes that aren't allowed in the key; higher the value, more time you're allowed on that note before it'll snap you to a note in the key. I'll keep it pretty low usually but it all depends on the vocalist. I've never really fucked with natural vibrato. Humanize is nice. Let's longer sustained notes wobble a bit even at high retune speeds. Sometimes I'll really crank it, but it does take away from the autotune effect if that's what you're going for.\nOne other tip is I like to flip to advanced mode and set major/minor in the bottom section (leave top drop down in chromatic). This allows you to bypass or allow certain notes that aren't in the key. So if you wanna hit that flat seven now and then, bingo",

It's so common these days for songs to be maxed out with a nacho-cheese level of intensity. The emotional affect is turned up to a ten. Everything is maximally dramatic.

I'm no Beckley, but browsing whats been previously shared here and trial and error has been the mechanism of growth for me.\n\nI kinda had the note separation tool workflow down from work in other programs. I've been experimenting with the time tool and attack speed tool as well as formant shifting to mask when the tuning becomes more audible than I'd like. That's probably where I'd pinpoint the level up for me personally. That and trying to be more conscious about not relying too much on the graphical UI. Unless it's something that really calls for hard tuning I lean towards wanting it to feel invisible / natural. Im realizing more what parts of the note actually need to be more 'on' and which can be more 'off' or just left alone. That and letting notes naturally drift to become more sharp as they tail off. If I'm too heavy handed it starts to feel lifeless to me. I'm also appreciating more the nuance of how one might approach different genres or styles with melodyne. Its humbling how powerful the program really is.\n\nThere've been a few moments with the attack speed tool that have felt like magic curing some subtleties of the performances that bug me, but I don't feel super confident that I have a grasp on that one yet. I've been working in standalone and importing a REF mix. For some reason I feel more confident dealing with esses in protools with RX or clip gain than I do melodyne idk why. Some frustrations have been flipping back and forth between tracks when tuning multiple files feels real clunky. I might be missing something about how best to do that. I wish, like with RX monitor, you could hear the vocal through your mix chain when tuning (is that possible?). Being able to rename exported files would be nice too like in RX.",

So about an hour or two into the session, I got real with the artist and said \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being too much of a control-freak and my comments seem to be distracting you. Why don\u2019t we take a break? When we come back, let\u2019s forget about everything I mentioned earlier and see how things come out when you express freely. I have a feeling that it\u2019s gonna turn out way better. I\u2019m sorry, I think I got it your way\u201d \n\nthen after the break, the artist started nailing the takes. Not in the exact way I imagined, but in the best possible way that we were capable of THAT DAY. \n\nSince then, I decided to let go of control a bit more and let the artists do their thing as much as I can. I started developing ears for hearing what artists can work on before the session to get a better recording to my best of ability (if I get to know them before the sesh). I would only mention the simple things that can be improved with small adjustments short-term. That way the session can be more experimental and wild as opposed to fault-finding.",

If you are trying to converge on final guitar takes while your client is wanting to diverge and explore new creative ideas, then might be worth explicitly communicating 'this is where we're at and here's what we need to get done today' as lead producer before you begin tracking just so everyone knows. I'd be wary of stifling the exploration / play of your client, but maybe you could have them channel that into a notebook or voice memo in the back of the studio and you could schedule a time with the sole purpose of fucking around and exploring / playing with new ideas. Really just wanna make sure everyone knows when you're in 'convergence mode' and when you're in 'divergence mode' to avoid that frustration.",

    "content": "There's no right way to go about sound selection, but ultimately you have to use your intuition and taste to judge if they're right for the record you're making. If the sounds don't seem to fit, then perhaps you need to ask yourself what effect it is that you're going for in the first place. Why are you trying to put *those* two sounds together? Decide if they get you close to that goal. If not, then simply find another sound. Not everything needs to work.\n\nA lot of it comes down to intention and conviction. \"Wrong\" notes or sounds that are dramatically different can still be pulled off if you play them with confidence and panache. Records are full of sonic choices that stick out like a sore thumb, and we can make them sound coherent with conviction. What might sound abrasive and weird at first can easily become habituated and familiar with enough exposure.\n\nI think almost any combination is valid. There are sound choices that are conventional and there are choices that go against the grain. Every unconventional choice is an opportunity to create a new genre or to create a new mood. It can be a matter of mindset. If you can free yourself from the need to do the \"right\" thing then the creativity to play with unusual combinations will come a lot easier.\n\nOf course, this is all hard to discuss without hearing examples. If you can give us more examples of what you're dealing with perhaps we can be more specific.",

But remember YOU are the one who holds the keys to the execution of the artist's ideas. You can have ideas and try them yourself, but if the artist has ideas, it's still YOU that has to execute them (because presumably they're not a producer like you). \n\nSo you're actually building a big creative trust by helping the artist try stuff. If you can execute ideas that the artist can't quite articulate or do themselves, you gain a credibility where you can both listen and then say \"Ah, I see what you mean.

The characteristic sound of this patch is a saturated LPF with an ADSR filter sweep. It may actually be a monophonic synth with a second oscillator tuned to +7 and blended in at a lower volume. It doesn't sound like they're playing chords, so much as stacked oscillators.\n\nAs others mentioned, a Prophet is a good place to start, but it's not going to get you that heavy-grit saturation by itself that we hear on this record. Prophets don't get that dirty on their own. Maybe the Prophet X's with DSP effects will. I haven't used them.\n\nSomething like a Moog synth is going to lean heavier into the saturation capabilities. That record feels much more like a Moog filter. A Moog Matriarch is the first thing I'd reach for if it were available to use.\n\nThat said, you've probably got enough saturation boxes lying around that you can approximate that grit. But it's a very Moog-y saturation sound.",

Typically the higher pitched/attacky things like hi hats come earlier than the sub kicks for example but experiment with it and see what sounds good. A song where this is really obvious is say it right by nelly furtado, listen to the way the layers are stacked on the downbeats of the chorus. Side note, when you're doing this, think of everything with a transient on that downbeat as a percussion instrument.",

I think a lot of what Taylor Skye is doing is taking sounds and then warping them/distorting them to shit using all of the \"wrong\" methods, and then just judging what comes out and deciding if it should be kept. I think there's a good hint of this in the lead sound at the start, where it's really out of rhythm and grainy, some notes seem to sort of \"break\" which reminds me of the results you get when you try to formant shift a verbed-out or polyphonic sound with little alterboy, or even abusing izotope RX on something that doesn't really need it (also, the RX de-reverb can do wild things to a sound you've put reverb on higher in the chain). Logic, which is what he uses, also has a lesser known formant shift that you can only get to by turning on flex pitch then adjusting in the side info bar, which can really take sounds into space. I haven't done this with melodyne, but I imagine there are some similar features.",

The original Massive had a lot of aliasing that could make it sound hazy and flat. Switching over to Massive X it is crystal clear and even buzzy saw waves feel warm, pure, and tactile.\n\nIt has extremely flexible modulation capabilities that I find to be very musical as well as some very comprehensive ADSHR envelopes. It also has four different keyboard tracking curves that you can assign and tweak, which is very important when fine-tuning your patch to make sure that it sounds even across the entire range of keys.\n\nIt has a lot of musical sounding filters that can inject a ton of vibe, or be completely neutral. The *noise* section is robust and very flexible. I use it a lot.\n\nFinally, it has a great-sounding set of internal effects (delay, chorus, saturation, verb, etc) that can be placed anywhere inside of the routing diagram. It's always a bummer when the on-board effects aren't very inspiring. But NI has a strong catalog of well-designed dsp to draw on and integrate into their products, so it's turned out great.\n\nOverall, it's a very robust and well-rounded synthesizer that also does a lot of things extremely well. It can be super clean (like Serum) but also get very dirty, which I appreciate in a synth.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that the preset browser kind of sucks. I prefer the original Massive's browser. NI is well aware and they have been overhauling it and slowly adding new features, so I trust in time this will be made better.",

Audiences in the 1800s, for instance, could go to a symphonic concert and recognize sonata form, key centers, etc. There was an appreciation for the form of the music and the virtuosity of the player first and foremost. Acknowledgement of skill. Making things seem effortless was the ideal.\n\nContemporary listeners seem to connect more with the struggle. They want to hear the grit in the vocal, the player at the edge of their ability (whatever it may be) holding on for dear life. The mix at the edge of distortion. In that breaking point, there is a lot of beauty and emotion that would have traditionally been considered bad form. Uncouth, even!",

And then you can learn with arturia DX7 in conjunction with how the different configuration work. +FM8 has patch morphing function which can be VERY useful when it comes to FM sounds. Another cool thing about FM8 is that it shows you all of the sidebands. \n\nFrom here, it\u2019s all experimentation\n\nThat\u2019s really all you need, FM looks intimidating but it\u2019s really not that difficult. \n\n\nlinear FM is essentially really fast vibrato. Non linear FM is a fast trill between the two frequencies. AM is essentially fast *unipolar* tremolo, RM is fast *bipolar: meaning it shifts polarity too* tremolo. they all create sonic characters by creating sidebands. \n\none thing to keep in mind is most FM synths are actually not FM. it\u2019s actually imitated by doing phase modulation- but results are almost identical. except in actual FM, you get more of the carrier frequency. So FM with a high-pass filtered modulator is essentially the same as PM with a low pass filtered modulator\n\n\nrun down on difference in sidebands between the most common audio-rate modulated synthesis:\n\nFM/PM creates equally spaced sidebands\n\nRM only produces sidebands (carrier frequency + modulator frequency & carrier frequency- modulator frequency)\n\nAM is carrier with side bands of c+m and c-m",

But in chasing the expression of the full height of the musicial and vocal talents of the group. They made this hugely confident and robust piece of art. By doing that they lost the heart of the song. The magic was in the umami effect lyrically and in performace of the vocal over the uke. The way her vocal would dance around feeling loose and unsure to striking and confident. \"Im confident im insecure.\" Is such a clever contradiction. There was nothing unsure or lacking in confidence in this final production or vocal performace. It was, we're as talented as anyone on earth, listen and watch!! Lost the \"see saw effect\" I loved about it initally. Just missed the mark for me.",

It's in the eye of the beholder imo.\n\nYou could have a kid who just downloads FL, loads up a splice loop and happens to find a perfect kick and snare to go on it, the beat slaps, (technically good production?) but does this make him a good producer??\nYou see where I'm going haha",

    "content": "As a practical example of when not being in phase is the right move:\n\nJon Castelli did a live mix on Twitch on Wednesday that included live drums. He identified that one of the snare mics sounded fuller when he inverted the polarity and proceeded to mix with that. \n\nLater in that session when it came time for notes, the producer (who was present in the room) asked why the snare had lost a certain thin and \"woody\" character that they liked. Jon reverted the snare mic to it's original polarity and the producer went \"Ahh! There it is.\"\n\nSo the takeaway here is that while drums usually *do* sing the best and hit the hardest when they're all working in phase with one another, sometimes the creative intention overrides the need to align them in a way that makes them most \"full\".\n\nAs you say: If it sounds good, it is good.",

Both have their place for sure.\n\nOne thing you keyed in on that is really crucial is the \"space\" you ask them to fill. Even something as simple as \"ad lib between vocal lines\" tells the player a lot about where they need to fit in, while still giving them a lot of freedom to bring their thing to the production. \n\nCertainly a place for all of these approaches, and the more you know and trust the musicians around you, the easier it becomes to envision where it might go (and leave room for pleasant surprises).",

    "content": "I agree with @BatMeckley's approach on this. Have them execute your vision, and then once you have it let them go wild and swing big. Try something new.\n\nIt's up to either the artist or you, as the producer, to have a vision for what the song is, where it's going, and what it needs. One of you have to have a roadmap. *Someone* needs to have the vision. To be the leader. To steer the ship.\n\nIf the vision is not clear then perhaps the song itself needs to be refined some more until it has a strong identity. That will be your north star for creative decisions. \n\nIf you can convey the essence of the song to your players, the emotion behind it, then they can interpret that feeling in a way that is uniquely them without the need for you to dictate their parts. If you can give them an emotion and maybe some general contour of what you're hearing then they can fill in the spaces and bring their own qualities.\n\nAs producer, part of your job is curating the talent that you recruit to realize your vision. If you know what the song needs you can confidently pick a player with complimentary sensibilities. If you can pick the right person then very often most of the work is done by virtue of them being aligned with the song. Each of their contributions and ideas are likely to be excellent.\n\n----",

I\u2019d not realised at all that those clipped peaks are  sort of returned / recycled into the signal . Fascinating . Thanks for the enlightenment man . I\u2019ll have to read up on that . And this fact of course gives evidence to your point that using a delta is a longer way round to try and achieve much the same . I listened to the delta in kotelnikov and couldn\u2019t see how it could sound musical to return that to the mixbus . It sounded like the sound of mp3 stream buffering glitches , so I figured I must not have understood something and left it at that . With the potential imo for phase issues I left the idea behind , but I was intrigued if Ryan\u2019s comment about deltas pertained to the same thing . Another lesson learned here today .

Between Noah's conviction about a piezo DI on the cello to get that raucous grit and the Alter Boy we're 85% of the way there.\n\nThe only unknowns are the exact octaver and the means to get it sounding so incredibly dry and claustrophobic. That sense of proximity is still the biggest mystery to me.\n\nIt's such a visceral sound. I'm gonna keep running this down and I'll report back if I find anything else. Thanks folks!",

    "content": "As others have said, recreating a beat you like is the school you need to go to. One of my favorite beats of all time is Fleetwood Mac's \"Hypnotized\" which is a swingy, triplet unchanging thing that is effectively a drum loop through the song, except Mick Fleetwood plays it. I recreated it using a sample pack of Mick Fleetwood's and turned it into a song after serious finagling, especially in the context of grid music. The insight into accent, velocity, swing, where in the grid things hit (or don't), which specific hits matter and how dropping just one or two key hits in a repetitive pattern can shift the groove entirely. It also tests your chops for figuring out choke groups, how to make closed and open hi hats sound \"real\" (if that's your goal) so on and so forth. I also love recreating a beat as a way in when musical inspiration may be lacking.",

If every artist OP works with hired a shitty mixer for the next 5 years and the only solution he had in mind was to to pay out of pocket, that\u2019s a lot of money he\u2019s losing that could be invested in his own tools and life. This is why I would advocate for a creative problem solving compromise of sorts - find ways to wrap it for free or cheap that don\u2019t suck, or convince the artist to budget better, or learn how to finish out your vision yourself from the rough mixes.",

Most of the punk, post-punk and hardcore stuff I listened to in the 90s would also fall well below a bar most would consider \u201cwell produced\u201d but the music transcends any of that for me. \n\nSo\u2026by my measure, all of these recordings I mentioned ARE well-produced by nature of them being good to me and still \u201cadding up\u201d so to speak. By somebody else's measure, they may not be because they don\u2019t meet some threshold -- be it technical, artistic, whatever -- of what they consider well-produced.",

    "content": "All of these methods suggested will yield in different results. \n\nResonators are made from delay using feedback to create tones. So you may need to resample to kill sustains - or not if you want it to have lengthiness. If you are going for SOPHIE kind of sound then you'd probably keep the feedback. \n\nBooms (filter resonance) are similar mechanisms but less tonal unless you turn up the feedback a lot more - it will certainly be more natural sounding as opposed to comb-filtery sound. \n\nLayering will give more focused pitch while maintaining the integrity of the layered sample sound, you would probably have the most control this way. \n\nVocoder will have inherently baked sound because of the synthesis mechanism, it can be desirable or not depending on the scenario. \n\nWith sampler looping, you will get grainier tail - dialing in the decay is necessary if you want the sound to be percussive because it will just continue sustaining. You can create pads this way too!",

If you are able to sing somewhat in pitch, try and sing the percussion sound, and find a note on the piano that matches it.

Obviously a positive outcome in one way, but it's the same thing that's scuppered my progress for years (including on ever getting to properly know the OP1).\n\nI was thinking to try emulate some patches from songs by ear.

First, it\u2019s insanely glitchy on my M1 computer which is funny since this is the version that\u2019s supposed to be compatible. Still running Pro Tools through Rosetta but Auto Tune will consistently freeze up my sessions to the point of me uninstalling it and going back to the previous version. So that made it unusable for me right off the bat. Second, for some reason, it has a mix knob. Even if I wanted to blend an octave down or some effected vocal with the dry, I\u2019d want the dry to be in tune. Not a natural dry vocal against a tuned octave down. Third, the default in AAX I remember was the craziest setting. I forget exactly what it was but I remember spending 20 minutes just trying to get it to tune and relearn where everything was. My last  biggest issue is that I\u2019m pretty sure Code Meter (Antares iLok substitute) kicks Dante in the balls every time it wants to check my license. This means late packets on my DVS and in extreme circumstances, drop outs. Autotune doesn\u2019t even have to be in the session for this to happen. This is a hard issue to prove so I\u2019m still a little unsure if I\u2019m right about this one but after uninstalling everything Antares, this problem went away. Super niche issue but wanted to throw it in there since it\u2019s been causing gray hairs lately",

Anyway, I went back and fact-checked myself for my, and anyone else's, benefit:\n\n- It's Tones mode that roughly works like manual stretching. Emphasis on *roughly*\n\n- HiQ is only intended to reduce artifacts from SRC or pitch-shifting. It does have an effect on audio quality and doesn't need to be on if you're not doing one of those two things. Stretching in Complex or Complex Pro does not need HiQ to be on.\n\n- It's unclear whether the Infinitewave SRC measurements for Ableton apply to the SRC algorithm used for warping.\n\nOn the other point, we don't need to know the nuts and bolts, but it would be nice to unambiguously know when something is degrading sound quality in Ableton's case, or behaving differently in different versions of the 'same' software in Celemony's case.",

    "content": "Method: Recorded vocal at 192kHz into Pro Tools. Exported via Shift+CMD+K at 192kHz and again at 48kHz. Vocals were both imported into Melodyne application in monophonic mode. Administered time stretching (both lengthened and shortened) via the time tool. Also administered pitch shifting via pitch tool and checked detection of tuning via correct pitch macro. After exporting these, they were reimported to see if detection had changed.\n\nObjective Results:\n-Upon import, vocal tempo detection was different. (One detected in 5/4, the other in 3/4, at drastically different tempos).\n-For short notes, when using the time tool to stretch, there were audible differences in results.\n-For long notes, when using the time tool to shorten, there was significantly less audible difference (subjectively: no difference)\n-For pitch detection, the algorithm detected pitch differently both audibly and visually.\n\nSubjective Opinions:\n-Time stretching yielded reduced artifacts in extreme settings when done at 192kHz. It did not eliminate all artifacts, but did reduce them.\n-When time stretching in a more nuanced way, the differences in artifacts were negligible.\n-When adjusting pitch manually, there was no audible difference in the quality of the pitch shifting at different sample rates. (For this test, everything was shifted up half an octave before any adjustments made)\n-When detecting pitch, both behaved quite differently. This was partially due to detection of select blobs being different at either sample rate. (This was most surprising to me of all the results)\n-When blobs were adjusted to match as closely as possible by hand, the tuning seemed to behave identically, including locations and levels of artifacts. (My gut says they \u201cfelt\u201d different but that is most likely either placebo or the slight differences in true blob locations)",

For example you shift it +12 and play C1 it will take the sample from C0 and play it at double speed - changing the character of the sound sometimes drastically. If the range knob is at 50% and shift is at 0 and you play C0 it will use the sample from G0 (because it\u2019s 50% the distance from C0) and if you play C2 it will use the sample from G1 - also has interesting effects on the sound. I still haven\u2019t figured out the best way of explaining this function but I find it really usable and I\u2019ve never seen sometime implement it before.",

He tinkers with parts on his own in Logic against the rough and he added a great part with a Logic instrument that is good...but it has a very specific effect that I'd like to recreate in Ableton. Anybody have any thoughts on how to get this rhythmic gating effect using Ableton effects or know of a plugin that makes this trivial? I've included a sample of the audio, a screenshot of the Logic patch and a screenshot of the very straightforward MIDI from which it is derived. (Worse comes to worse we can use an export of the audio, but would like to see if I can crack it for maximum flexibility).\n\nI tried fucking with Beat Repeat and it's close, but not quite the same.

We house everything in DB as the \u201cmaster\u201d session then each backup to our own backup systems. \n\nOne thing we\u2019ve noticed is that PT seems less happy working out of DB on our rigs \u2014 I\u2019m going to experiment with \u201cpausing sync\u201d in DB next time we get into a heavy session as we\u2019re actually working to see if that helps. \n\nBut generally has worked great aside from a slight performance dip (which doesn\u2019t seem to affect some other people as much, so maybe it\u2019s just our own rigs\u2019 issues). And general best practices of Save-As\u2019ing often have proven important as we\u2019re both working on various things so we\u2019re not messing up each other\u2019s work/sessions.",
