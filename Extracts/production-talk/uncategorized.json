Is the world loose and rough and not technically correct? Great, embrace that! Is the world tight and precise and full-range and punchy? Great, do that!

I neglected temperature circumstances, power up options etc. and after 10 months of regular and reliable use, I lost 1.5 TBs of data (many of them being songs and production data) because the motor arm inside the HD was broken and the magnetism of the disk fucked up. I managed to scavenge up old saves of my 3 most valuable songs and 50 GBs of data but it sucked. SDs are more expensive yes, but to get that HD fully repaired would have cost me $900-1200 for a problem that could have been avoided if I spent $200 upfront. So if you can afford it, the more advanced & non mechanical option is better.",

The swagger/I been wronged/they all slept on me/I\u2019m the genius overtones are incredibly boring and kind of ugly to me. A huge part of it is cultural, in Ireland that kind of talk is just socially unacceptable, almost to a fault. And the flip is that Terrace came up in a very different environment",

People are often buying different things than we are selling. This has been made painfully clear to me in the acoustics space.",

He was suggesting it as a pysch acoustic technique for perceived loudness .I expect I\u2019m missing something here , but I\u2019m thinking this differs from clipping in the sense that clipping chops off those peaks , not to be returned , whereas I believe he is attempting to return the peaks as.

A few years ago I did something similar and tracked the choir then left everything in place and tracked just the wedge to polarity invert the track later.

However, i realized it was making me way too conservative with how much i was clipping and saturating things. Part of the beauty of those techniques is precisely that it makes it loud without changing the peak level. \n\nEspecially with producing, just let it be loud and have fun with it. If you need to turn down what comes out of that Saturator plugin, just trim down that Output knob.",

Just under 500USD in last 30 days. It's picking up more steam the last few months which is why I'm on discord asking these questions I guess haha.\n\nNot sure how long I'd do it for and would eventually pivot if the right opportunities came as I do agree that most big time producers if they ever start off selling type beats eventually stop as you can't be selling yourself for those lease prices once you're established really.",

And how to articulate that behind the scenes, reasons why. Deep topic. Applies to any role I think but especially production, knowing when an idea is worth pursuing\n\nIn regards to AI, who knows.

There\u2019s a much deeper thing I\u2019m getting at I think, maybe I\u2019ll articulate it sometime if I can find the words, it\u2019s not really related to mastering at all\n\nBut I will say I think it\u2019s possible to both understand someone\u2019s hopes for a record and remain objective as to what it needs, while retaining the option to do the opposite of what was described if necessary. Also usually if I\u2019m discussing it\u2019s more like\u2026not even about actual moves related to a record. \n\nI trust your perspective on this, but I think you\u2019d advise me to find my own way even it it includes the valley of despair",

I feel like 30 or so years after this clip was shot we have a evolved a bit and hopefully strayed away a bit from a toxic studio attitude and insulting/becoming personal towards ppl we produce. I was wondering if any of you could share some stories or could give advice on how to make sure musicians live up to their full potential/helping them when they\u2018re clearly stuck etc. but inside using positive affirmation and language without making them feel inferior/insulting them or bein passive aggressive?",

You can make a hit record with someone, treat them like shit, and lose the next gig\u201d that for the most part, in my experience that doesn\u2019t hold true. If you make a hit, even if you were shitty, you\u2019re more likely to get the gig, than if you did your not so best work and treated them great. \n\nBut that it CERTAINLY shouldn\u2019t have to be an either or situation. \n(I really liked your personal trainer analogy if you need some agreeing mixed in \ud83e\ude75)",

    "content": "Also. As a musician recording the take, I found that trying to correct timing as I\u2019m playing ends up with worse results post-editing vs just being flat out wrong. Meaning if I am off, it ends up being easier to edit if i continue being off until the end of the phrase. I could just nudge the whole thing, and it will be perfect. If I correct myself mid phrase, I will end up having to move thing note by note - which frankly would be better off doing another take. \n\nJust like how stable flat or sharp note is so much easier to fix in a natural way than fixing \u201cunstable but on pitch sometimes\u201d notes\n\nAnd this is because there are two different timings\n\nThe time feel in relation to everyone else\n\nThe internal time feel of individual musicians in the ensemble. \n\nWhile both things need to be considered, for recording - it\u2019s usually better to prioritize the latter when things are off. Making things fit together that have solid internal time is much easier and less work than making everything that fit together sometimes, but then don\u2019t other times. \n\nBut this only matters if you are the one playing the instruments. If you\u2019re just editing, then the question comes down to does it need to be re-played or frankensteined",

I guess the solution is print and comp, but I\u2019m still in throwing paint mode and just want it all to feel good as I work.\n\nWill take a look at some of those options, thanks!",

Have rarely enjoyed his works without that polluting the experience of understanding the man behind the notes.  \n\nSimilar with Charlie Parker.

    "content": "Hey guys, recently me and a couple of friends went to the Gasometer buildings in Vienna which used to be old gigantic gas tanks and are now hosting shops, studios and concert venues. The reverb inside is quite remarkable, so we wanted to capture that sound. Recorded with 2 Shure KSM 32s in stereo. There is a bit of atmos/noise as we had to record it with people there walking by so it's not the cleanest samples ever but I think they still sound really cool and maybe could be useful sometime \ud83d\ude42 \nUnfortunately we could only record a handful of samples as we were shooed away by a guy there after 15 minutes because we didn't have a \"permit\". \nanyway, I hope this is OK to post here and I really hope some of you will like the samples and maybe even use it one of your productions in the future - feel free to grab and download em here: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4ozxcwg308fkmktzlmj8l/AKz8wGU_wGU9RzlFJDrh0e8?rlkey=4hdhnapnld7lxrnwsh7btqmrz&st=tuxmgyya&dl=0",

Consider it lucky and generous when someone shares something that took them years to figure out. Also it\u2019s fun to try and figure things out on your own and often you will come up with your own unique way of doing  things",

We now get to look back at the 1970s and cherry pick all of the amazing stuff that endured and forget about the bad stuff.\n\nThe same is going to happen for this current moment. We're being exposed to a lot of subpar records and a few great ones every year, and over time we'll forget about the wack stuff. So there's a bit of perceptual bias that we have to keep in mind when comparing to our current moment in time.\n\nThat said, if someone is still incapable of finding amazing records today then maybe they need to keep searching.",

In fact, my personal belief is that, like any art form, it constantly evolves through different eras while maintaining a certain continuity within that broader evolution\u2014if that makes sense.\n\nI don\u2019t think painting during the Renaissance was better or worse than during Impressionism. I can love Rembrandt and Degas at the same time. The same goes for music.\n\nAlso, I want to emphasize that those kinds of questions are totally valid and necessary\u2014I just don\u2019t like the way he approaches the topic.\n\nThere are great examples of stellar conversations about this subject from a healthier perspective. You and Ruair\u00ed are great examples of that.\n\nP.S. I\u2019m the kind of weird guy who usually prefers newer records from old bands, haha. For example, Failure\u2014I freaking love their last two records even more than the classic Fantastic Planet from \u201997!",
