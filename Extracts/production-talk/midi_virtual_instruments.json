    "content": "By far, the most important element in realistic orchestral sound is in the programming. You need a controller where you can automate cc1 and cc11 (modulation and expression). Instruments, especially strings, are constantly changing their volumes. Particularly on entrances and phrase-ends. If you don't have a controller for this, you can draw it all in, but that gets really tedious.\n\nIf you get that figured out, I can almost guarantee that just about any library out there will get you good results. So then it's just a matter of what sound do you gravitate towards, how elaborate of a feature set do you need, etc. Legatos are overrated and I'd take no legato over a poorly programmed one any day.\n\nIf you want a full orchestra, not just strings, I'd check out some of the all-in-one offerings from Spitfire (Albion, BBC Orchestra, or Abbey Road), East West, Orchestral Tools (Inspire), or VSL (Prime). They all will have several different articulations, a decent amount of dynamic layers, and a full set of orchestral instruments. Have a listen to them and see what sounds grab you. Spitfire and Orchestral Tools have a more prominent room sound baked in, but they all do to some extent. So be aware that, whichever library you choose, there's a certain amount of \"reverb\" (which is actually just the hall they're recorded in) that you will never be able to turn off.",

    "content": "One tip I'd give is to make your patch while you have a MIDI sequence playing. Not just some static, even arpeggio that you drew in, but a part that has different articulations, note lengths, velocities, and covers a range of notes.\n\nIt's easy when making a patch to just keep your finger on one key and go *doot doot doot* (tweak) *doot doot doot* (tweak again). What you can end up doing this way is optimizing the patch and parameters for a single note or handful of notes. And it gets old to listen to. By keeping the entire musical part playing you're going to move through building a well-balanced patch much quicker.\n\nIf you have a part in mind, record the MIDI with your starter/init patch, spend some time tweaking the patch while the sequence plays, and then once you get into the ballpark replay the MIDI part using your new patch. The new synth settings will influence your articulation and feel when you record the second time around. Then refine your patch as needed. Rinse and repeat until you're satisfied.",

Loading it up for the first time today and will follow up with any additional thoughts, but right off the bat - you've GOT to make those parameters MIDI assignable. I have a big pet peeve for VSTs that don't map expression (cc11) to volume  by default, but beyond that, vibrato and the ADSR seem like no-brainers to be able to assign to a CC.\n\nI love the reverse function, I can tell that'll be really useful. \n\nI'd be surprised if @Rollmottle didn't mention this, but it's very odd to me that Saturation is controlled by dragging that little flame icon when everything else is much more straightforward. \n\nLast thought for now - when you get ready to release this, put your best patch as the default. You want people to load this up and be inspired and interested in diving into what it can do. Most people can't get away with the ear-splitting default patch from Omnisphere, and why would you want to anyway?",

Picking up on the midi ticks convo last week, if youre programming in Logic , instead of dragging (and losing track of your moves) in the timeline/piano roll....throw one of these on an insert and increase the delay in tiny increments as you run down the track (typically hats and offbeat/ghost snares first) . You can quickly create the pocket youre looking for . Also added bonus...I believe under c. 12ms most people arent hearing a glaring time shift , (i dont go above 2ms ) so the delay is handy again just putting your hats , snares, percussive elements....just a millisecond or two behind/in front of each other so all your transient sounds are not hitting the 1/4,1/8, 16th counts at precisely the same instant. I find this helps with transients. Lastly, unlink the left and right on a stereo channel and youve got an instant width tool. Best for the transient and groove use tho imo.",

Modeling these behaviors is a good way to start thinking musically with a synthesizer.\n\nSo if I'm going for a \"horn\" instrument I want a patch that can do attack-y stabs, but also fade into notes and have complete dynamic control. It should also have some sort of brightness feature that I can open up at will, like blowing harder into some brass.\n\nIf I'm emulating a voice there's going to be a big emphasis on legato playing and fluidity, with some very expressive pitch control for bends and vibrato. Maybe some form of subtle formant control to shade the notes like a singer would with different vowel sounds.\n\nAn organ patch is going to be a dead simple note-on/note-off volume envelope with the expression coming from the addition or subtraction of different oscillators.\n\nAnd some patches are just going to be gangly chaotic messes that you do your best to wrangle. Something with a lot of chaos and feedback and squealing. You can't control it, but you just strap in.",

    "content": "Another thing to keep in mind is that most libraries, especially orchestral ones, require a negative predelay for the notes to sound in time. Often somewhere between 10-50ms, but some are up to 300ms. So if everything feels late to the grid, it likely needs an offset. If it's the gentle attack of the recorded performance, not much you can do besides try a different articulation or library.",

I pretty much always fall into the latter.\n\nAs long as you have a decent library with enough round robins, short string lines are one of the easiest things to make sound good. I haven't used BBCSO, but I know it's light on variations in exchange for having a full set of orchestral instruments and articulations at a budget price. Any of Spitfire's main libraries would be fine, or Cinematic Studio Strings, Orchestral Tools.. pretty much anything should do the job as long as it has enough round robins and hopefully at least 4 dynamic layers.",

It must be a decade old at this point, but Spectrasonics do a good job at supporting it. They're constantly patching it and a few months ago they added a fully-sampled felt piano instrument that sounds excellent.\n\nKontakt wouldn't be a bad investment either, since it's the backbone of NI's entire business model at this point, it comes with a sizeable sample library (not just piano), and new sample instruments are constantly being developed for the platform.",

Great for getting something in quickly, and I still use it quite a bit.\n\nSD definitely had a learning curve for me but DAMN you can go deep if you really want to tweak out on drum programming.  There are tons of articulations, tons of microphones, and the expansions are all super in depth as well so you can shop around and figure out what is best.  It's definitely at a premium though for price, and I don't reach for it as often if I'm trying to get an idea out quickly, but I just used it today to play in some hihats because it sounds closer to real to my ears than AD.\n\nThe other thing I'd add about SD is the install size is pretty massive.  I have the core library with all the mics installed and their EZX kick and snares library and it's taking 250GB on one of my externals.  Oh by the way you can use any EZ Drummer libraries in SD which are more similar in depth to Addictive Drums stuff and they put out a few new libraries a year.",

Think of them more like initialized synth templates with pre-determined routings and modulation that I can start with and then diverge from. I still use other people's presets, but using these templates can save me a good 15 minutes every time that I want to build a new patch and don't want to start all the way from scratch. They come with a lot of built-in expression.\n\nOn most of these I've got a lot of the keyboard tracking already tuned so that a bright patch doesn't get too harsh as I go up in register or it doesn't get too flabby and lose definition in the low-end.\n\nI've got one patch set up for very expressive pitch modulation. Lots of big sweeps and bends in the attack/release envelope phases. Think wonky Neptunes-type sounds or two-octave dive bombs. Stuff like that.\n\nOne patch is set for expressive filter and amplitude modulation. Wobbles, envelope modulations, and such. It's my go-to if I'm trying to play with some \"brassy\" dynamics.\n\nOne is a legato mono patch for very fluid vocal-like playing. A big emphasis on note articulation and variation. I think of it as a solo instrument.\n\nThe final one is (you called it) A nice poly synth. Think James Blake on a Prophet. Pretty standard stuff, but once again it's got keyboard tracking that's tuned up so that the patch feels rich across the entire range.",

Playing it is much faster and more feel, but often times it will need editing unless you have great timing. If it\u2019s something loose then I\u2019d definitely go ahead and move each notes because quantizing even 50% is going to change the feel. This is real nerdy but when there\u2019s a really good moment in groove, I use logic\u2019s event editor to look at how many ticks they are off by and snap other notes to somewhere near. For example, if I liked the feel of it being 40 ticks late then I\u2019m gonna move everything (or some select notes that are in the same spot of the groove cycle) to somewhere nearby. Ticks are tempo relative so 50 ticks in 90bpm is different than 50 ticks in 120bpm. But it\u2019s still in same relative timeline, but it\u2019s going to feel different in different tempos. \n\nIf you want it to groove like a drummer played it, best thing to do is play it in. You might end up quantizing or fixing velocity to al 127 later, but it\u2019s going to be better than clicked in sequence if that is the style. Clicked in sequenced drums is its own groove too, you don\u2019t want them having looseness so you quantize them all to 0 but you can still mess around with nudging them to be a bit behind or ahead of the grid.",

I'm after something that would work well for Indie Pop/Rock kinda stuff - so something that works well for real sounds / something that I would be able to use as a stepping stone for real drum tracking. Even better if the sounds are flexible enough for me to avoid drum tracking all together. \ud83d\ude42\nSuperior Drummer 3 seems to pop up a lot but just wanted to see what you guys are using? \nCheers.",

I agree with you very much (at my own current level ) with regards to what mastering means, I agree it should feel like a sacred moment for everyone . Stepping away from the work and letting it take on its own life in the world , not continually calling it back for \u201cwhat ifs and afterthoughts \u201c until the moment it was , is lost ...and now its not the capture and articulation of those days in the studio....but musical ponderings attached to those studio moments . But how to articulate this to a young artist who hasn\u2019t been through this passage yet can be tricky. In my culture , here in south London we are v careful to never tell each other what to think or to \u201ccorrect\u201d one another , it\u2019s felt as a disrespect and respect is all in my circles.....I don\u2019t disagree with it, but it makes it very hard to create \u201cteachable moments \u201c . The ideas I\u2019ve received from you and Noah are both genuinely applicable and helpful though in exactly this conundrum and I feel a little lighter already . \u201cWeighting \u201c:is a great concept to consider .

This means if I play something, I'm going to need to be quantizing audio and I'm relying on the visual aid of the waveform because my inherent sense of groove is pretty weak. So I'm looking for advice on quick heuristics for quantizing audio. \n\nTodays example: I played some palm muted acoustic guitars, I've marked the scrape of the pick in red and the peak of the waveform where the note truly starts ringing in green. The waveform actually starts a little before the scrape as you can see where the pick touches the string wave over on the left . How are y'all thinking about which part of this waveform should fall on which side of the beat?",

I've also got the *Spitfire BBC Symphony* but I'm less fond of those because they're recorded from an orchestral perspective and have a lot of room sound baked in, whereas *Session Strings 2* have a closer perspective. If you want an ensemble sound plus some major grit and close-miking I *do* like the *Bernard Hermann* orchestral library from Spitfire.\n\nFor solo strings the *NI Cremona Quartet* instruments are really, really nice. They're a pleasure to play with and sound fantastic. These have maximum presence too, so you can get some very direct sounds with them. I'm really enjoying them. The articulation and tonal options are extremely thorough.\n\nA while back a few people recommended *Sunset Strings* by Realitone. While I haven't used it yet, they look very promising. They seem to be serving people who want a rock/pop string feel, which could be just the ticket.",

But if I draw a MIDI note with a whole-note duration the synthesizer would modulate it's envelope time and that same sweep would descend over the course of a whole-note.\n\nThe synth would have to read upcoming MIDI note lengths from the the piano roll and modulate it's parameters on a note by note basis by reading the note duration before the note-on message.

I dived into phoebe\u2019s stuff just last week, funny that it took me 4 year to check out an Amazing album even thou i have been following her on instagram since 2020. What blew me up was, most of the modern productions in the pop side of industry, the sad songs, all of them are inspirationally ripping phoebe\u2019s sound. I was mad at tony berg when i saw his interview where he gatekept a vst they used throughout the album to get that muffled texture. But in the past two days, i also realised he said \u201cWe are not going to tell you the vst just so you at home can not replicate the sound\u201d. I thought that was asshollery until i realised that they are actually being ripped so hard in the industry and that they really gotta protect their sound. Tony, Phoebe, Ethan these guys are hidden unknown diamonds \u201ci think (like me) a lot of people know phoebe as a celebrity than a music artist, or that was just me being lazy to check out her songs\u201d but i feel like everyone needs to experience their music.",

He tinkers with parts on his own in Logic against the rough and he added a great part with a Logic instrument that is good...but it has a very specific effect that I'd like to recreate in Ableton. Anybody have any thoughts on how to get this rhythmic gating effect using Ableton effects or know of a plugin that makes this trivial? I've included a sample of the audio, a screenshot of the Logic patch and a screenshot of the very straightforward MIDI from which it is derived. (Worse comes to worse we can use an export of the audio, but would like to see if I can crack it for maximum flexibility).\n\nI tried fucking with Beat Repeat and it's close, but not quite the same.

    "content": "here's the workflow:\n\nI don't use many of the preset kits anymore. Just not really the sounds I'm looking for. I have a massive library of samples that i like to use. Accessing those is easy.\nThe problem is I don't make preset kits. Every session, every kit, is a different combination of things, always starting fresh. So I am in the Library view constantly going through samples/files to load into any Cell of Battery.\n\nWhen I find a sound I like, I can click it or drag it to the cell I want. This is all great.\n\nBut, the second i drop it in, I have to change the velocity from 0-100% (I saved my default preset to have all cells at 0% velocity which seems to be working). and then *every time i add a new sample or replace a sample* it makes it a loop in the \"Editor\" window. There is no shortcut, no preference, no saving a preset, that allows me to essentially remove that behavior.",
