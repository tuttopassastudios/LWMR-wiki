Generally there is a dominant instrument that the song was written on such as guitar or piano maybe a synth.  Take a filled out productions and mute all the main ingredients and leave the additive colors, only the sprinkles on top. And start rebuilding the production around that. It can take you to an entirely different  universe and provide contrast in the arch of the record",

    "content": "By far, the most important element in realistic orchestral sound is in the programming. You need a controller where you can automate cc1 and cc11 (modulation and expression). Instruments, especially strings, are constantly changing their volumes. Particularly on entrances and phrase-ends. If you don't have a controller for this, you can draw it all in, but that gets really tedious.\n\nIf you get that figured out, I can almost guarantee that just about any library out there will get you good results. So then it's just a matter of what sound do you gravitate towards, how elaborate of a feature set do you need, etc. Legatos are overrated and I'd take no legato over a poorly programmed one any day.\n\nIf you want a full orchestra, not just strings, I'd check out some of the all-in-one offerings from Spitfire (Albion, BBC Orchestra, or Abbey Road), East West, Orchestral Tools (Inspire), or VSL (Prime). They all will have several different articulations, a decent amount of dynamic layers, and a full set of orchestral instruments. Have a listen to them and see what sounds grab you. Spitfire and Orchestral Tools have a more prominent room sound baked in, but they all do to some extent. So be aware that, whichever library you choose, there's a certain amount of \"reverb\" (which is actually just the hall they're recorded in) that you will never be able to turn off.",

But, if you took one home and used it as your one pre across 100 tracks of your masterpiece, even your parents are going to hear the difference between it and a vintage neve. That small 5% difference really added up at the end. I\u2019m sure after floor two of the leaning tower of Pisa the engineers we\u2019re like \u201clookin good boss! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc \u201c and it wasn\u2019t til they compounded their error that people started to panic.\nIf you\u2019re making tracks 95% in the box with samples and soft synths and then just drop a featured rapper on top of it, it\u2019s probably not going to matter if you use a Scarlett or an Apollo or an Apogee. But if you\u2019re a professional mixer constantly printing stuff 100x a session through outboard gear you\u2019re going to notice a difference I can guarantee you. Or if you\u2019re doing a Low record where there\u2019s only three elements and one of them is the most gifted voice of a generation, the gear is going to matter a lot more than if you\u2019re squeezing a TikTok star into 37 plugins and then into a 150 track mix.\n\nSo at the end of the day, much like producing, songwriting or pretty much everything else in life, it\u2019s that old prayer of strength to change the things you can, the grace to accept the things you can\u2019t, and the most important bit that everyone seems to skip over, THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. \n\nDo what works for you, and clearly, I sweat the details enough to notice that the algorithms are different, or Cians dangerous was down a half a db on one side, but also, when to actually use that information to actually make the actual point.

    "content": "One thing I love to do to help me wrap my head around sounds and tools is basically \u201ctranscribing\u201d a preset to a new initialized patch on the same synth. Keep hitting the keys as you go to see how copying each setting changes the sound, and see if the end result is the same when you think you\u2019re done. Often you\u2019ll be completely missing some modulator somewhere and you\u2019ll really need to dig through the synth\u2019s features to find something you didn\u2019t know before. As a bonus, you can try the same thing but have the synth that the preset comes from and the synth you\u2019re recreating it in be two different tools, like trying to remake you\u2019re favorite serum patch in Pigments. Sometimes certain features will be missing outright and you\u2019ll just have to use your ears to get close, but I find this really useful for figuring the inherent differences in the tools at my disposal. Best thing about both of these exercises is they only take about 10-15 minutes a patch, then you\u2019re on to something new",

    "content": "Wow. I'm making my way slowly through this Lanois/Beato interview and am amazed by what Lanois is describing from @ 52:24 to 53:45 regarding his approach to stacking modulations and special effects.\n\nAs he describes it, he's performing and printing his modulation effects (delay, verb, vibrato, pitch shifting, etc) one generation at a time as he iterates through the song. This allows him to fine-tune and perform the modulations on each successive pass so that every moment is honed and responsive enough that it becomes a part within the music, and not just a blanket effects chain.\n\nSo if he's doing pitch-shifted delays, he'll do a pass that goes up a fifth on certain notes and then layer another pass that modulates by a different interval at a select moment instead of leaving everything on throughout the entire section. He's honing each effect in sequence. It shows a tremendous care and sensitivity to the music that he would go through and *perform* each layer with so much intention.\n\nThis feels like a revelation to me and I can't wait to practice this.\n\n(I've cued up the video where they start talking about it)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxP9kKzbCFA&t=3144s",

Sean should charge for that plugin because it's so good.\n\nIt's a delay plugin that specializes in super-long and evolving echoes with lots of modulation. Sean has described the different algorithms as \"too exotic\" for his other plugins so he bundled them all together as *Supermassive*.\n\nIt certainly excels in that role, and also doubles as a good lush reverb when you turn up the diffusion knob.\n\nFunnily, I almost never use it for long echoes. As it turns out, it's really good at creating super-tight and roomy sounds. Just dial the delay time to < 15 ms and turn up the feedback and suddenly you have a very lush and chorus-y \"room\" sound. Kind of like a Quantec or something from a Jimmy Edgar record.",

    "content": "Good question! \n\nAs @cian riordan said, when you're perfectly lining up the waveform of any solid tone, you want equal gain so it doesn't give you a boost on the crossfade. This is for \"correlated\" signals where the waveform is lining up exactly. A bass guitar, the middle of a vocal note, a synth with a consistent waveform, etc.\n\nWhen you're doing a crossfade on noise (breaths, sss's, ambience between drum hits, etc), you want equal power because these \"uncorrelated\" signals need a bit of boost around the crossfade for the perceived loudness to be the same.\n\nYou can check this by using a synth note or long vocal note, doing an edit to make it longer or shorter, lining up the waveforms perfectly, and doing a cross fade. You will find that equal power causes a volume bump. Equal gain will be smooth.\n\nDo the same thing with white noise and this time equal power will be smooth, while equal gain will cause a volume dip.",

(2023) reported differences in tuning results between the plugin and standalone versions of Melodyne. This investigator undertook a test of Melodyne plugin, ARA and standalone versions to determine whether the resulting tuned audio would null.\n\n**METHODS**\n\nAll testing was performed at a sample rate of 48kHz and with .wav files at a bit depth of 32 bits. Tuning was tested using two 2-second square wave tones generated with FabFilter One in Logic Pro X. Tone #1 was generated at a constant pitch of C4 +50ct. Tone #2 was generated at a pitch of C4 with the following settings: Modulation Generator (MG) Frequency set to 4.033 Hz,  MG waveform set to value 0.500, and Frequency Modulation MG set to value 0.123. Each tone was printed on a separate channel as a Bounce-in-place (bip). The two bips were then joined into a single, 6-second, mono .wav file with 2 seconds of silence between the bips. The 6-second .wav file was copied onto two new channels in Logic Pro X, and dragged out of Logic Pro onto the desktop for use in Melodyne standalone.\n\nAudio was transferred into Melodyne: one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne non-ARA, one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne ARA, and the copy of the .wav file on the desktop was loaded into Melodyne standalone. All transfers were completed using the Melodic (Standard) algorithm. \n\nTransferred audio was quantized to pitch C4, offset 0 ct, Pitch Modulation 0.0%, Pitch Drift 0.0%. All other settings were left at defaults; Note Assignment mode was checked to verify that Playback Type in each case was 'Tonal'. \n\nResulting audio was printed and imported into three new mono channels in Logic Pro X. Null testing was performed using the phase invert feature in Logic Pro X's stock 'Gain' plugin.",

On its own, it could just as easily be a stock piece of music from a library to my ears. \n\nI like well-produced music, but I\u2019d rather have REALLY GREAT MUSIC above all else.

    "content": "One tip I'd give is to make your patch while you have a MIDI sequence playing. Not just some static, even arpeggio that you drew in, but a part that has different articulations, note lengths, velocities, and covers a range of notes.\n\nIt's easy when making a patch to just keep your finger on one key and go *doot doot doot* (tweak) *doot doot doot* (tweak again). What you can end up doing this way is optimizing the patch and parameters for a single note or handful of notes. And it gets old to listen to. By keeping the entire musical part playing you're going to move through building a well-balanced patch much quicker.\n\nIf you have a part in mind, record the MIDI with your starter/init patch, spend some time tweaking the patch while the sequence plays, and then once you get into the ballpark replay the MIDI part using your new patch. The new synth settings will influence your articulation and feel when you record the second time around. Then refine your patch as needed. Rinse and repeat until you're satisfied.",

Is it up-front or does it sink into the back? It's easy for a 4x4 to feel hackneyed or overbearing. Sometimes all you need is a gentle *pat pat pat pat* to tie things together.\n\nA fresh or unconventional texture will open up drastically different feels. People can dance to anything if it's got a 4x4 click, so it doesn't necessarily *need* to be a kick. You can go far using samples and percussion that sit in different registers, but play the same role.\n\n3) **Complimentary instruments**. If the kick is the \"rock\" then the groove is going to come from how everything else swings over that. What's the friction like between the kick and the other elements? If the kick is a \"straight man\", then the other elements pushing off of it are where the magic comes from.",

The characteristic sound of this patch is a saturated LPF with an ADSR filter sweep. It may actually be a monophonic synth with a second oscillator tuned to +7 and blended in at a lower volume. It doesn't sound like they're playing chords, so much as stacked oscillators.\n\nAs others mentioned, a Prophet is a good place to start, but it's not going to get you that heavy-grit saturation by itself that we hear on this record. Prophets don't get that dirty on their own. Maybe the Prophet X's with DSP effects will. I haven't used them.\n\nSomething like a Moog synth is going to lean heavier into the saturation capabilities. That record feels much more like a Moog filter. A Moog Matriarch is the first thing I'd reach for if it were available to use.\n\nThat said, you've probably got enough saturation boxes lying around that you can approximate that grit.

In my case, it was string quartet, nylon guitar, percussion, and electronics. That also led to cool \u201cchoices\u201d that came from like, having my violist play a part I made the demo of on a semi-modular mono synth. Ensemble can be a unifying lens to capture your diverse ideas through and give them a sense of unity",

    "content": "Yup! Massive was my go-to for years prior to Massive X.\n\nThe biggest change for me is that the raw oscillators sound far better. The original Massive had a lot of aliasing that could make it sound hazy and flat. Switching over to Massive X it is crystal clear and even buzzy saw waves feel warm, pure, and tactile.\n\nIt has extremely flexible modulation capabilities that I find to be very musical as well as some very comprehensive ADSHR envelopes. It also has four different keyboard tracking curves that you can assign and tweak, which is very important when fine-tuning your patch to make sure that it sounds even across the entire range of keys.\n\nIt has a lot of musical sounding filters that can inject a ton of vibe, or be completely neutral. The *noise* section is robust and very flexible. I use it a lot.\n\nFinally, it has a great-sounding set of internal effects (delay, chorus, saturation, verb, etc) that can be placed anywhere inside of the routing diagram. It's always a bummer when the on-board effects aren't very inspiring. But NI has a strong catalog of well-designed dsp to draw on and integrate into their products, so it's turned out great.\n\nOverall, it's a very robust and well-rounded synthesizer that also does a lot of things extremely well. It can be super clean (like Serum) but also get very dirty, which I appreciate in a synth.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that the preset browser kind of sucks. I prefer the original Massive's browser. NI is well aware and they have been overhauling it and slowly adding new features, so I trust in time this will be made better.",

There's so much overlap between the feature set and if you can get very intuitive with one synth you'll go so much farther.\n\nBack in the day I bought NI's *Komplete* bundle and it was just way too many new instruments too fast. Too many options. I never got to know any of them very well. Most synths have all of the same features that you'll want, but there's still a learning curve for every single one that you have to get over before you can be really expressive. I wish it were as easy as picking up a guitar or a horn where everything is standardized and lies in the same place. But that's part of what makes synths great: Their plasticity.\n\nNowadays the only synths I reach for (unless I need a very specific sound) are *Massive X*, *Razor*, and my Moog Sub 37. The first two are very different and don't share many features. I use the Moog when I don't want to be tethered to my computer. Limiting my available tools has been a net benefit for me.",

Non linear FM is a fast trill between the two frequencies.

Depends on how the artist likes to work, time line, amount of sessions that are possible to have together and so on.

Having dynamics and \u201cbusiness\u201d on an XY pad is pretty useful for knocking demos together, then you can convert those \u201cdrummer regions\u201d to midi to tweak. Also the hi hats are usable, in a world where it\u2019s still relatively difficult to program convincing 1/8 and 1/16 hat patterns",

    "content": "Oh, just one more thing. I find it very helpful to practice making patches by trying to emulate a given instrument's expression. I'm primarily thinking about note articulation, here. Modeling these behaviors is a good way to start thinking musically with a synthesizer.\n\nSo if I'm going for a \"horn\" instrument I want a patch that can do attack-y stabs, but also fade into notes and have complete dynamic control. It should also have some sort of brightness feature that I can open up at will, like blowing harder into some brass.\n\nIf I'm emulating a voice there's going to be a big emphasis on legato playing and fluidity, with some very expressive pitch control for bends and vibrato. Maybe some form of subtle formant control to shade the notes like a singer would with different vowel sounds.\n\nAn organ patch is going to be a dead simple note-on/note-off volume envelope with the expression coming from the addition or subtraction of different oscillators.\n\nAnd some patches are just going to be gangly chaotic messes that you do your best to wrangle. Something with a lot of chaos and feedback and squealing. You can't control it, but you just strap in.",

I'm in awe of Autechre and their usage. If you really dig FM there's an *amazing* book that John Chowing wrote in the 80s for the Yamaha DX7 which is the best thing I've ever read on FM. It's goes for $500 today, but you can find a .pdf for free no problem. Strong recommend if you want to build up your intuitions for FM.",

That said, knobs on the desk that do midi can be had easy too.\n\n @Rollmottle would know more than me (or anyone else literally as far as application to producing goes), but if action is a big deal to you I\u2019d check those out, you can also mount them to drawer slides easily or whatever, they are thin\n\nI\u2019ve posted this here before but the Extra Deluxe one looks insanely cool too (but very expensive and I doubt it\u2019s coming back ever).

    "content": "the controller is called continuum. I believe it is an mpe (midi polyphonic expressions) device. I don\u2019t know much about kyma but i would look into physical modeling because this is what the sound generation is based on. A lot of physical modeling is heavily based on delay lines, so I\u2019d start there. Modal synthesis is also another cool concept where you would feed an impulse sample into a bank of parallel bandpass filters (very narrow q- which is also constructed with delay lines fundamentally). The idea is feedback and resonance from the filters would emulate acoustic modes. \n\nYou can emulate this with fairly cheap stuff like leap motion, I\u2019ve done a different project (something much simpler) with leap motion for gesture controlled music concr\u00e8te. But you can definitely use the gestures to do the same thing with physical modeling. I\u2019d be down to work on something together if you\u2019re interested!",

Recently I realized that the term \"production\" gets used in a lot of different ways. I used to think everybody meant more or the less what I consider production to be: the recording or engineering of the sounds in the song (so, sound design too), the layering or vertical arrangement of instruments and sounds, and (to a lesser degree) the way those sounds are balanced/mixed to fit together. What made me reconsider this definition was hearing a handful of reviews for the new Charli XCX album criticize the \"production\" on songs like this one:",

I'll play with forward swing and dragging notes a lot if I'm going for a more real/dynamic feel when programming. keeping in mind that if the goal is trying to stay \"on time\" any fwd swing that might happen at the start of a phrase will be compensated with some drag  after or vice versa.  keeping velocities in mind w drum hits + linking it to a filter env so that harder hits have more high end and softer hits end up a bit rounder.\n\nadding subtle layers that are similar   to the main drums but occupy a different texture or tone  in dif  sections to thicken up the groove or automate the attack /sustain of certain elements thru diff sections to help shift the listener  focus throughout",

Something about the way that it reacts to movements in the lead and its blurriness reminds me of some of the wackier presets in valhalla delay where it'll pitch down echoes 2 octaves or so and filter them out. They're not the most useful most of the time because it would probably ruin whatever preexisting bassline you have going, but this sort of setting would be the place to try them out.",

That's a cool goal.\n\nSo it sounds like part of what you're seeking are techniques to add pitched resonance to samples that may be atonal?\n\nWell a resonator is a great start. If you're not already into it, I'd look into the karplus-strong theorem and physical modeling synthesis. That whole field has a lot of overlap with what you're describing. It's the kind of thing you'd hear Sophie or Jimmy Edgar do with their Elektron Monomachine.\n\n*AAS* have a whole suite of physical modeling products that function similar to *resonator*, but are third-party plugins. Doing percussion synthesis with *Chromaphone* can do a pretty convincing recreation of certain percussion tones with the added bonus of being as flexible as a synthesizer, because it is a synthesizer!\n\nYou could tune a high-feedback delay unit until it rings at the pitch you're seeking. I can elaborate if you need more explanation. Funnily, that's the entire basis for physical modeling synthesizers.\n\nAlternately, you could layer your samples with gently-blended sine tones.

    "content": "It's really simple. It's basically creating a loop within a sampler and reducing the loop length to such a small window of time that the looped audio is perceived as a pitch. You \"tune\" it by adjusting the loop length shorter or longer.\n\nI think the biggest issue is that vanilla samplers don't tend to give you very fine control unless they're built for sound design. Their loop length parameter will often go from 5 ms - 5000 ms, when what you really need is a loop in the 1 ms - 100 ms range.\n\nSo it might involve a custom-built device in *Reaktor* or something equivalent.",

    "content": "All of these methods suggested will yield in different results. \n\nResonators are made from delay using feedback to create tones. So you may need to resample to kill sustains - or not if you want it to have lengthiness. If you are going for SOPHIE kind of sound then you'd probably keep the feedback. \n\nBooms (filter resonance) are similar mechanisms but less tonal unless you turn up the feedback a lot more - it will certainly be more natural sounding as opposed to comb-filtery sound. \n\nLayering will give more focused pitch while maintaining the integrity of the layered sample sound, you would probably have the most control this way. \n\nVocoder will have inherently baked sound because of the synthesis mechanism, it can be desirable or not depending on the scenario. \n\nWith sampler looping, you will get grainier tail - dialing in the decay is necessary if you want the sound to be percussive because it will just continue sustaining. You can create pads this way too!",

I decided to learn Serum while I'm back home for xmas, and having a lovely time making my way through the manual on AirPods.\n\nWhen I'm just experimenting, I tend to get inspired by a sound or a part that comes out of my fingers while I'm tweaking, and next thing I know I've made a track but abandoned the curriculum. Obviously a positive outcome in one way, but it's the same thing that's scuppered my progress for years (including on ever getting to properly know the OP1).\n\nI was thinking to try emulate some patches from songs by ear. Then there's YT tutorials from the likes of Mr. Bill and other EDM people, they'd probably keep me occupied for a minute.\n\nBeyond that, would you suggest any fun ways to keep myself interested in learning and honing my skills?",

    "content": "Totally. \n\nSo I should clarify a little bit. These 3-4 patches aren't static sounds that I never change. Think of them more like initialized synth templates with pre-determined routings and modulation that I can start with and then diverge from. I still use other people's presets, but using these templates can save me a good 15 minutes every time that I want to build a new patch and don't want to start all the way from scratch. They come with a lot of built-in expression.\n\nOn most of these I've got a lot of the keyboard tracking already tuned so that a bright patch doesn't get too harsh as I go up in register or it doesn't get too flabby and lose definition in the low-end.\n\nI've got one patch set up for very expressive pitch modulation. Lots of big sweeps and bends in the attack/release envelope phases. Think wonky Neptunes-type sounds or two-octave dive bombs. Stuff like that.\n\nOne patch is set for expressive filter and amplitude modulation. Wobbles, envelope modulations, and such. It's my go-to if I'm trying to play with some \"brassy\" dynamics.\n\nOne is a legato mono patch for very fluid vocal-like playing. A big emphasis on note articulation and variation. I think of it as a solo instrument.\n\nThe final one is (you called it) A nice poly synth. Think James Blake on a Prophet. Pretty standard stuff, but once again it's got keyboard tracking that's tuned up so that the patch feels rich across the entire range.",

    "content": "Hmmm. I wouldn't say that you *need* a Moog, but they're always a nice color to have in the kit. And it doesn't hurt that they're a \"classic\" sound, so having one around wouldn't be a bad investment and will likely see a lot of use over the years.\n\nThe last generation of Moog synths (from Sub37 onward) have been very gritty and have a lot of options for drive and feedback, which allows them to get very rough, in contrast to the Dave Smith synths which tend to be cleaner, buzzy, and articulate. These days Moogs are very warm, thick, and gritty. They're extremely easy on the ears, even when you're cranking the drive. The core components of Moog sound *really* good and there's a lot of care that's gone into the raw sound of these things. Namely the oscillators and the filter circuit. They are *very* well designed instruments. In fact, I'd say that they're *beautiful* instruments.\n\nMy recommendation for someone who's not super-deep into synthesis but wants to own a Moog would be to buy a *Subsequent 37*. It's got digitally recallable presets, whereas *Matriarch* and *Grandmother* are semi-modular and have little/no preset capability. The Subsequent 37 is plug and play, has a great set of unique features, wonderful grit, and is very fun to play.\n\nKeep in mind that the *Subsequent 37* is a monophonic synth. Technically it's paraphonic (can play up to *two* notes at a time), but you're not going to be playing any chords on it like on your Prophet.",

At least yet\u2026 But honestly don\u2019t think there will be that much more in the future either. AI machine learning has so many other avenues that are easier to implement (with wider use cases and profit model) that going into this side of the audio won\u2019t be as lucrative of an investment of time. It\u2019d really take those with real passion and dedication into making that kind of software. \n\nHave you seen google Magenta project? It\u2019s not exactly modeling but it creates profile of a sound and allows you to make a playable instrument out of that",

I started to using a DAW in my 14s (FL Studio, yeah I know xD) and in the last 3 years I've been using Logic Pro and last months Pro Tools (just for editing and mixing).\n\nI love to produce electronic pop with a mix between synths and acoustic instruments. I want to be more versatile and confortable producing other genres (genres that I can produce just in my bedroom studio without having a great recording gear). \n\nI'm feeling stuck, I'm trying to listen different genres. I'm feeling very limited because I don't have a great background as a music player or student (my bsc is physics engineering). The music industry is tough and I want to be more confortable to work in other genres.\n\nI tried to be as brief as possible. What advice do you have for this situation?

You could try tweaking the waveform to a slightly different Saw wave, but this is probably as close you'll get with the Serum LPFs and enveloping. You'll need to mess around with pitch bend and attack time to get the performative aspect of this lead line, and especially when you do the pitch bend - you might need some help from the compressor to get the sustain out of that slow pitch bend,\n\nWhenever you hear buzziness it's usually LFO on OSC level on a faster rate. This same lead sound is all over different styles of EDM so it's a good patch to know. Kaskade - Atmosphere has the same lead but in square wave with other layers as well.",

And I've read a lot of them.\n\nChowning demonstrates patches by building them up unit by unit using the Yamaha DX7, but the techniques are platform agnostic and any FM synth worth it's salt will do what you need to follow along.\n\nThe book is a collector's item these days and sells for $500-$1000/copy, but you can find a .pdf scan online. I'd print it out and go through the examples. DM me if you have trouble finding it.\n\nAlso, if anyone ever wants to buy me a gift, this would be a safe bet.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Fm-Theory-Applications-Musicians/dp/4636174828",

    "content": "My current approach to this involves a couple of principles, but this is the first that comes to mind:\n\n1. If there\u2019s a part with bg vocals performing different lines than the lead and there\u2019s a lot going on, I try to have a spot earlier in the song where the exactly lines those BGs are performing have a moment to shine. For example, if there\u2019s a low energy bridge where they can be clearly understood before the big hook where they can be perceived but not understood as well in the midst of so much. \n\nWhat this does is allow the listeners brain to process what\u2019s being said with little effort, and then later when it\u2019s in a tornado they can still perceive what it\u2019s saying because they recognize it as something their brain already knows, so it\u2019s not overwhelming for their brain to understand the words of multiple vocals going at once if there are layers of lines being performed (usually syncopated) around each other.\n\nThis applies to instruments as well, but instead of intelligibility of words I focus more on cutting frequencies so everything can fit well in the big moments. If they head a synth at full power in the intro and it comes back for a final hook, you can get away with cutting a lot of meat off of it and still have it be perceived as the same synth, without muddying the mix and also creating a nice \u2018bringing the song full circle\u2019 feeling - If the track calls for that.\n\nI typed this off the cuff based in gut instinct so not standing by this message as full proof, but this all feels right to me as I explore what I have done for tracks, without having this much thought or words to it.",

Noah's comment unlocked something, I hadn't done before, moving the melody thru different layers. The main melodic guitar. I had it at like 60% where I normally leave it. But had it widen to over 80% in chorus. Then more narrow than I would normally have a doubled melodic at like 35%. Usually id just do one guitar, mono to scratch the scene change itch. I save hard panned left right area for chorus guitars or stereo stereo synths to swim in. That with dropping the piano for first half of verse 2 did the trick! Still hoping this is a catalyst for more sharing of ideas",

    "content": "I feel that sometimes in a production an element can be added which is distracting from the essence of the production - a \"tacky\" synth line, an acoustic guitar which feels disjointed etc. Often it's something that feels like it doesn't suit the genre/vibe of the track or has an emphasis in a particular frequency range which makes it feel un-glued in the mix. This can sometimes be legitimized by having the part played by another sound or by recording the sound differently, in my opinion. Or sometimes the part it just superfluous per se.",

However, I go to to explore other elements (extra vocal layers, extra synths, etc.) and it just throws this feeling of balance off. It's probably a mental barrier after listening to what the demo sounds like so much, but at the same time, I think the track could objectively benefit from some filling out.",

Can it do Melodyne-style inflections on a note? Or is it a little more \"spray and pray\" where you have to generate a few revisions to get what you're looking for?",
