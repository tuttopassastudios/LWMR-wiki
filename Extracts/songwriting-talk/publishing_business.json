    "content": "If you're trying to be a highly successful professional, you should do all of these things and be prepared to adjust on the fly.\n\nI pretty much always have full songs, tracks, hooks, and concepts prepared. Much of the time, you won't use any of them on any given day. But good news: they're useful for future days.\n\nI've had all of that prepared and then the artist and I just chat for five hours, then write a song on a piano.\n\nI've had all that prepared and then cut song after song because the artist goes \"what else do you have???\"\n\nAnecdote that might be helpful: I've been in with an artist all week. Me, another producer/writer, and her. The other producer/writer has his rig set up and he also writes topline. We usually bounce back and forth depending on what the song requires. We've all worked together before and we had the whole week blocked out so there's no pressure to perform on day one. But we did three songs on the first day because she just came in firing. The first song she came in with a title and we worked from scratch and knocked it out in an hour. The other producer made the track quick with some existing drum loops he had prepped for her, adding keys and horns as we wrote. Then she asked \"do you have anything to play?\" I played her a track hook I had prepared. She liked it and we powered through that one in another hour. Then we broke for lunch. We caught up. As we were finishing she mentioned this one kinda stupid and sassy idea she tried to bring into another session but the producers didn't like it. So we wrote that one and it was fire. I tapped out a tempo as she rapped the hook idea and just make a skeleton beat on the fly.\n\nBeing way over prepared is rarely going to hurt you.",

If you\u2019re not familiar with his work, he\u2019s 98 years old and has written lyrics for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Aretha Franklin to Quincey Jones to half of the artists your grandma listened to. \n\nAnyways, some good takeaways from last night\u2019s convo:\n\n\u201cWriters these days are more interested in immediate appeal than they are in a great song. They aren\u2019t the same thing. A great song is only a great song if people will want to cover it in 30 years\u201d \n\nHe cares immensely that whatever is being said in a song is worth saying. Does the message have strong intrinsic value?  \n\nHe\u2019s verrrry quick to say he doesn\u2019t like a song.\n\nHe has a strong preference for melody being written before the lyrics, which is particularly interesting consider his career is as a lyric guy. \n\nHe has a strong dislike for slant rhymes. (I disagreed and it turned into a whole family convo about phonetic tension and release)\n\nHe\u2019s still writing every single day without fail. Today he\u2019s writing on an upcoming Pat Metheny record. \n\nHe\u2019s never heard of Drake or Olivia Rodrigo. Mind you his wife was the president of ASCAP for 15 years so this is particularly mind blowing. It shows me how siloed different worlds can be even when they are so similar and near to one another. What wisdom does one silo have on lock that the other is missing? What rules have been taught to us by people in one silo that don\u2019t apply in the silos we ourselves are working in? A lot to chew on here.",

I\u2019m in mastering now, so while I do a lot of collaboration it\u2019s not quite what you\u2019re getting at here but I\u2019ve got a decent amount of experience in the room/tracking/producing. \n\nTo me it is a matter of developing trust and belief with another person. My approach is to be brutally honest with people and let the chips fall where they may. When things are amazing, meh, or bad. As @BatMeckley said\u2026you want the $10k mic. Don\u2019t waste the time with anything in the middle.\n\nSo in short \u2014 I\u2019d just tell them exactly what you wrote above. But I tend to be more on the extremes \u2014 I\u2019d like to think that people come away from working with me with a deep-seated belief in themselves and their potential but also honest feedback about very specific things we can do better. I actively seek to challenge my collaborators (which I\u2019m sure you do as well). I\u2019ve found people really respond to this if it\u2019s done with the clear intention to help both of us improve and with the curiosity of the potential in the art!\n\nIn short, I\u2019m an extreme encourager but also a harsh critic (in a kind way). I never let someone give up on themselves if I can help it and show love for them by very specifically calling out how I recognize their potential but see areas for improvement!\n\nI feel that I\u2019ve always been able to tell when people do things like \u201clead with a compliment\u201d or whatever. So that\u2019s my POV on this whole topic\u2026I just like people to be straight with me. When I have dealt with artists who clearly need the validation you\u2019re speaking about\u2026.I\u2019ll specifically call it out with something like \u201cstop looking for validation you have the talent to do this now start believing in yourself\u201d\u2026etc. Seems sort of harsh but it really can cut to the chase and open up a deeper level of trust and communication.\n\nSometimes people don\u2019t like this\u2026and that\u2019s all good too. Always lead with kindness and things work out. Depth > quantity",

    "content": "I\u2019m sure we all share this struggle to some degree. I\u2019ve got some projects that I\u2019ve put many hours into, just to let them sit on a hard drive for years.\n\nCo-writing has helped a lot, and has taken some ideas to places I never would have thought to go. The feeling that you have some moral obligation to your collaborators to finish is motivating. When you\u2019re making art for yourself, it doesn\u2019t benefit from those positive forces of peer pressure, and there\u2019s a lack of constraints and no sense of urgency. \n\nI think making creative decisions is metabolically expensive. It\u2019s easier to defer all decisions, which is why you see DAW-age producers committing to so little until the mix. In the same way you can defer the entire songwriting process, especially if you have someone else\u2019s project or deadline to prioritize over your own.\n\nTo be both the creative mind and the executive finisher is a lot of exhausting context switching. Some options might be to split these responsibilities with someone else, or to dedicate separate time to each task. If someone hires me to print stems or solder a patchbay, the last thing I want to do is engage in creativity. But when I get inspired to write, I don\u2019t want to stop and troubleshoot the plug-in that\u2019s crashing the session.\n\nMaybe like the divergence/convergence approach would be to set aside an hour or three at the end of your day to finish ideas you\u2019ve already got brewing\u2014set a timer and finish a song, or a verse. Or, even better yet, dedicate the *end* of your day to play and experimentation. Then the next morning, hopefully with fresh perspective, get in the mood to tie up loose ends and prepare your next steps. You\u2019ve demonstrated that you\u2019re good at wearing that hat for other artists, so you can do it for your songs, too. Just maybe not while you\u2019re in the creative flow.\n\nI\u2019m not practicing what I preach, just brain-dumping. I definitely don\u2019t have this figured out.",

But no one outside their friends and family knows the story, knows Trevor, knows the coffee shop, and so no one cares.

    "content": "This is a little of the top of my head, but I'll try and break it down like this. You're mostly going to get work/ collaborators for three reasons. \n\nThe #1 is your work (great songs, in this case). If you make great shit, people will either hear it and reach out, or when you meet someone, you'll send each other things and they'll love your work and want to be a part of what you can do. no matter where you are in your career, this is #1 always always always. When I was starting out, I produced some of the best sounding records for local bands, so other local bands wanted to work with me. Now, I (or my manager, or my publisher) can send a spotify playlist with songs people know, and that helps get me gigs.\n\n#2 is making shit with people you know personally. This is the best way to do it starting out since you don't have lots of great work out in the world. You need a little community of friends that you make shit with. I guess a lot of that will start moving online, but still the vast majority of great work gets done in person. Even during the pandemic, despite all the zoom writing session and remote work, most great stuff was still getting done in person. You gotta find your people and make things. Then you have the advantage of multiple people promoting your work.\n\n#3 is the pure cold call hustle. It's TOUGH. It's a low percentage game no matter what you're trying to do (be it mixing or writing or producing or being an artist). You have to understand that you may get 1% response rate from people. It's not to say it doesn't have value, but if you want responses, you have to have a good pitch and sending out thousands of messages. But the other thing about this is that writing songs remotely frankly fucking sucks compared to doing it in person. Songwriting is such an in the moment emotional thing. Producing and mixing remotely is very very different that doing real time creative vulnerability. This #3 applies more to non-songwriting collaborations than anything else.",

Like I can be happy with the potential of an idea, the experimentation, but to get to the finish line and say \"yeah this is done\" is something I struggle with on a deep, internal level - \"the war of art\" addresses this a lot with reference to Resistance.

For example, I can try break down the drums of a song into a  drum pattern, dynamics, feel, and the drum sound (type of drum kit, machine, and processing on it). \n\nBut with lyrics (or language) - it feels more gray to pinpoint how to take a concept and apply it into my own writing. How do you usually break it down?",

    "content": "I deal with (unintentional) inconsistent tempo and some time even time signature/pulse pretty often when working with songwriters and artists. It seems to solve the problem when you tap your feet to the melody. Then you would realize that the tempo has changed. And count 1-2-3-4 or whatever the meter is. So you don\u2019t end up unintentionally having an extra beat because of words and disrupt everything else. A lot of writers ask people for beats first for this reason, but if the melody doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own- relying on the beats will do more harm than good in my opinion. They often end up being mediocre melodies from my experience because there\u2019s already tons of subdivisions and grooves in the beat and the topliner is relying on that to drive the rhythmic feel. But also beats need to come in with pocket so there are space for the vocal melody to fit in. It would be good for writers to start without a beat or instrumentals and it would be good for beatmakers to practice leaving vocal pockets when starting with a beat first",

He was 19 at the time, literally only opened his mouth to very politely ask me for my email address so he could fly the beat into Pro Tools to cut vocals. But he was making absolute fire, and even though he didn't speak, you could feel a good vibe off him.\n\nI've also been in rooms with *unbelievably* obnoxious characters (the occasional particularly unpleasant example of that LA type we were discussing recently). Utterly repugnant as people, but their work is undeniable.\n\nI know who I prefer to be in a room with (and that really does count for a lot, in my experience), but in the speed dating world of pop music writing that a lot of people go through, you get all sorts. \n\nNot everyone is super charismatic of course, but that's just the world. Either way, 90% of the people I've met at the highest level are really delightful.\n\nAlso, my experience has been that the more accomplished the artist/writer/producer, the more lovely they've been. They've got nothing to prove, and perhaps at a certain level, anyone who's not truly undeniable has already been filtered out of those rooms by being a jerk on the way there.",

    "content": "Do the songwriters get paid to create those demos?  No...  but they often PAY OTHERS to help them make the demo possible.  Nashville folk will often have \"Demo Days\" where a group of Ace players charge a flat fee to perform and record the rhythm section (for instance, could be anything the song needs). They might record 5-10 tracks in a day. I'm sure some have done more. These \"demo day tracks\" are used by songwriters to then pitch their track to recording artists, labels, anyone.  There's also a whole army of producers ready to help songwriters demo-up...  where the songwriter pays a producer to turnkey the track.  Sometimes it's one guy playing everything or a few remote players all chipping in under the producers direction.  \n\nAnd...  these are viewed as a \"very basic demo\" in the eyes of industry vets. A really good \"one take\" by great players with high quality equipment recording the basic tracks is a strong demo but not fully produced. Happens all the time, but the producer (and their team) gets paid by the songwriter (or their team) to produce the track.",

    "content": "I circled around some of these ideas a few years ago here, but now I\u2019m more seriously thinking/asking for advice\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve never written a song in my life, and don\u2019t have any real desire to do so (more than happy to be mixer/producer/drummer/multi-instrumentalist guy). But, I have a friend who is a super prolific writer. He has his own artist project which I\u2019ve produced/mixed, and a few years ago had a publishing deal and has a good deal of writing credits. We\u2019re a really good yin/yang pair: he\u2019s focused on melody/lyrics/chords, I\u2019m focused on rhythm/sounds/texture/mix. We have a co-credit for a Suki Waterhouse song for the one and only explicitly \u201cwriting session\u201d we\u2019ve done together.\n\nI just reconnected with him and mentioned that I\u2019m about to be in a position where I could do more open-ended writing (/spec production?) sessions and would love to work with him again\u2014specifically on some projects that have approached me more in the writing stages, and most especially on reaching for bigger artists. And he\u2019s down!\n\nHere are my questions (and this is a *total* explain it to me like I\u2019m five situation\u2014I\u2019ve really struggled to make sense of things business/session flow-wise outside of getting paid for a discrete deliverable or a day rate):\n\nI don\u2019t feel a need to be too formal about things right now, but is this sort of partnership where we could pursue a joint publishing deal?\n\nMy main motivation is two-fold: keep a foot in production/engineering while I\u2019ve leaned more and more into mixing recently, and use our credits to get in a room with bigger artists. Am I way off here?\n\nAnything I\u2019m missing/obviously oblivious to?",

We just got done doing a big portion of an album for a legacy artist together and I\u2019m wondering how to keep it going. We\u2019re in Minneapolis and not moving any time soon but will travel too. We\u2019ve also done some pitch work for k-pop. I know a lot of music gets written today with the artist in the room, but there are still some places for pitch.

    "content": "The short answer is: you're a songwriter now too. This is a new part of your professional repertoire. This is great.\n\nI made a similar transition from producing bands to doing co-writing sessions as a producer. You can still get hired as a producer or engineer (as I still do), but writing sessions are structured with different expectations and potential outcomes. \n\nWhen you participate in songwriting sessions, you are almost never getting paid up front as an engineer or producer. There are some cases where super rich people will pay for songwriting sessions, or artist with bigger budgets might get their label to pay a studio fee, but this will be a tiny minority of your writing sessions. \n\nPhilosophically, the idea is that you're all creating something together that, if it's good enough, it will be released into the world in someway. But your experimenting and will make many ideas that don't cross that threshold. However, if any of the recordings of these song come out you will still get paid as a producer (/ engineer / mixer / whatever else you do on the final version). If no peace of the recording that you made when the song was written gets used, you will still participate as a songwriter on the copyright.",

    "content": "@peterlabberton  I've not seen a joint publishing deal as you describe it, though I suppose it's possible. Generally it makes sense for everyone to have separate publishing deals as many songs get written with different people and different splits. You could certainly sign to the same publisher at the same time, just with separate deals. Or this person could sign you to their publisher with some finders fee type thing.\n\nWhat it sounds like you're doing is providing a great sounding board and musicianship for someone who is more primarily a songwriter? If so, you would just participate in any songs that are written in the room. If it's the sort of thing where he is really doing the bulk of the songwriting (like all the lyrics and melody, and you're helping with some of the music) you could certainly work out a deal where you get a smaller piece.",

I can\u2019t remember the split but on the Suki song he did get a bigger cut. I got a production fee when it made the album and it all felt fair to me. It\u2019s registered with a PRO.",

In this course he spends hours going over exactly how he writes lyrics to his gibberish melodies. Then how he goes about pitching these ideas to artists. After he has 24k Goldn there for a few hours and they write another song to gibberish melody.
