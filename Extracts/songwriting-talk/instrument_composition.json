    "content": "If you're trying to be a highly successful professional, you should do all of these things and be prepared to adjust on the fly.\n\nI pretty much always have full songs, tracks, hooks, and concepts prepared. Much of the time, you won't use any of them on any given day. But good news: they're useful for future days.\n\nI've had all of that prepared and then the artist and I just chat for five hours, then write a song on a piano.\n\nI've had all that prepared and then cut song after song because the artist goes \"what else do you have???\"\n\nAnecdote that might be helpful: I've been in with an artist all week. Me, another producer/writer, and her. The other producer/writer has his rig set up and he also writes topline. We usually bounce back and forth depending on what the song requires. We've all worked together before and we had the whole week blocked out so there's no pressure to perform on day one. But we did three songs on the first day because she just came in firing. The first song she came in with a title and we worked from scratch and knocked it out in an hour. The other producer made the track quick with some existing drum loops he had prepped for her, adding keys and horns as we wrote. Then she asked \"do you have anything to play?\" I played her a track hook I had prepared. She liked it and we powered through that one in another hour. Then we broke for lunch. We caught up. As we were finishing she mentioned this one kinda stupid and sassy idea she tried to bring into another session but the producers didn't like it. So we wrote that one and it was fire. I tapped out a tempo as she rapped the hook idea and just make a skeleton beat on the fly.\n\nBeing way over prepared is rarely going to hurt you.",

    "content": "Some songwriting-related morning routine thoughts:\n\nI've been starting my day with doing piano scales and vocal warm ups to a metronome and then singing/ learning a song and recording a voice note of it. (recently it's been Tom Petty Wildflowers at the piano). Then I look at my phone and start my day.\n\nHard to know for sure if it's causal, but my songwriting abilities have sped up. I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks. \n\nI think it's related to several aspects of the morning routine, and they all compound. \n\n*I'm playing music before I'm on my phone, so I'm outputting music before my brain starts reacting.\n\n*doing scales w piano and voice opens up my vocabulary on both instruments and makes me much more comfortable to sing/play ideas when writing\n*doing these to a metronome has improved my timing on all instruments (not just piano and vocal)\n*learning a great song and singing it every morning has massively improved my lyrical writing/ improvisation (probably the hardest part of songwriting) by just reinforcing good *sounding* words.\n*singing and recording the same song every morning for a few days or a week makes me really THINK about vocals and vocal production. How I'm singing the words, how to push certain vowels in a certain part of my voice, etc \n\n@Slow Hand  @Ross Fortune @Will Melones @OJ",

    "content": "Yes exactly! I've found that the best songs are never calculated, they're always just felt as they're being created. They are magical/ incalculable moments. As soon as people start analyzing \u2013 \"is this too generic?\" \"maybe we should have a part like **insert artist**\" \u2013 the songs loses its magic.\n\nBut the paradox is that you can't  just sit around and wait for them to happen. You have to be in motion. So often times building habits and processes (which are calculated) is a great way to keep oneself in the motion of creating things. Piano scales, learning songs, writing a song a day, etc., are just some of the many ways to do this.\n\nAnd the other aspect is also correct. These are skill building exercises that help the quick translation of creative ideas. It's the emotional and psychological side of workflow. Just like technical workflow \u2013 where you want the shortest time between idea an execution \u2013 same goes for writing. If you are constantly writing lyrics and singing melodies and playing instruments, when that emotional magical idea arrives, you can translate it more quickly into lyrics, melody, and music.",

    "content": "I always tailor it to the artist in some way. It's a combination of making fresh ideas specifically for them and taking existing ideas that could work (sometimes reworking existing ideas). I never go into a session like an actual blind date where I don't know anything about them.\n\nThe challenge is always do I make something that sounds like what they've done, or do I make something that sounds like where they're going? That's impossible to answer. I've had success in major label POP artist sessions by having a 100 year old piano and specifically not playing tracks. Meaning, you never know if an artist is tired of doing the same shit. Because I have confidence in my skill as a producer, I'm happy to get an A+ ballad because I know I can turn it into whatever production I want. \"In The Name Of Love\" is my most successful example of this. It's an emotional 3 chord piano ballad that was produced into a festival EDM anthem. \n\nI've had the most success being prepared for all options. Mostly because that makes me flexible for what an artist is feeling that day, but also because the more stuff I make, the more music I'm making. If I prep for a session, I'm not working cold. The prep is also like a psychological and creative warm up for me. Prep makes me a better improviser.",

    "content": "Depending on the kind of wall that you\u2019re hitting with her, there are a few simple approaches that you can suggest that will get her thinking about the different dimensions of melody and how to play with it:\n\nA) Expansion - How long is the melody? It is a small fragment, or a full sentence? Stretch it out over a longer period of time. Sing it half as fast. Hold certain notes for emphasis.\n\nB) Diminution - Compress parts of the melody into faster runs. Make it shorter. Remove notes. Simplify the melody to its melodic essence.\n\nC) Repetition - Take a fragment of the melody and play it again. And again. And again.\n\nD) Modulation - Take a melodic idea and transpose it to different keys. The first movement of Beethoven\u2019s 5th Symphony is built entirely off of a simple four-note motif. He got a lot of mileage from such a small element.\n\nE) Dynamics - Play with volume or intensity. Encourage her to go from soft to loud, or loud to soft. Accent certain notes for emphasis. This one is really powerful. For inspiration suggest that she try voicing her dynamics like a great horn player might. Get her to clip her notes very short or to make them \u201cbloom\u201d or be soft and round. Make them bark or be breathy.\n\nF) Be Another Instrument - Encourage her to try writing as another instrument with her voice. Sing a bass line. Sing a horn part. Sing percussively like Michael Jackson or James Brown would.\n\nG) Role Playing - Give her a character and a persona to inhabit. Make her sing the same thing as different personalities or people. Pick a melody and then make her sing it in the style of three singers that she\u2019d know.",

Almost everyone I know, and seemingly everyone that asks questions here, just needs to write lyrics and melody over and over and over.\n\nIf you want to get reps to become a producer, that's awesome.

Do you feel fulfilled and connected to the experience of life by playing piano or singing or mixing or making weird keyboard sounds? \n\nI love all that shit so much.

Piano scales or learning songs or playing guitar for my girlfriend or whatever it is that makes me feel joy.\n\nIt's very important for me to have significant parts of my life that are creative and not for any purpose.",

    "content": "Ok this is one of my favorite topics ever.\n\nHappy to go deeper, but the gist is this: I believe people connect to the underlying emotion, even if their analytical brain isn't reading or understand the lyrics. If the emotion is authentic, the song has a MUCH better chance of connecting. Without that emotion, it is almost impossible. \n\nThe more I write songs, the older I get, the more I work with the greatest songwriters, the more I think that writing an authentic emotion is everything. \n\nA favorite example (I have 100 more, just ask): \n\nParty In The USA. Silly pop song? Or deep truth about the power of music being able to transcend loneliness? Go into the lyric and you realize it's Jessie J writing about her first time coming to Los Angeles: \n\nStepped off the plane at LAX with a dream and a cardigan... am I gonna fit in... everybody looks so famous... I'm feeling homesick, too much pressure and I'm nervous... but then my favorite song comes on the radio... I know I'm gonna be ok... it's a party in the USA\"\n\nTbh I tear up every time I think about this song. Yeah people might not analyze the lyric, but the reason this song will play for the next 50 years (and not the 1mil other simple songs about having a party) is the deep, authentic, universal emotion underlying the record.",

    "content": "I\u2019m sure we all share this struggle to some degree. I\u2019ve got some projects that I\u2019ve put many hours into, just to let them sit on a hard drive for years.\n\nCo-writing has helped a lot, and has taken some ideas to places I never would have thought to go. The feeling that you have some moral obligation to your collaborators to finish is motivating. When you\u2019re making art for yourself, it doesn\u2019t benefit from those positive forces of peer pressure, and there\u2019s a lack of constraints and no sense of urgency. \n\nI think making creative decisions is metabolically expensive. It\u2019s easier to defer all decisions, which is why you see DAW-age producers committing to so little until the mix. In the same way you can defer the entire songwriting process, especially if you have someone else\u2019s project or deadline to prioritize over your own.\n\nTo be both the creative mind and the executive finisher is a lot of exhausting context switching. Some options might be to split these responsibilities with someone else, or to dedicate separate time to each task. If someone hires me to print stems or solder a patchbay, the last thing I want to do is engage in creativity. But when I get inspired to write, I don\u2019t want to stop and troubleshoot the plug-in that\u2019s crashing the session.\n\nMaybe like the divergence/convergence approach would be to set aside an hour or three at the end of your day to finish ideas you\u2019ve already got brewing\u2014set a timer and finish a song, or a verse. Or, even better yet, dedicate the *end* of your day to play and experimentation. Then the next morning, hopefully with fresh perspective, get in the mood to tie up loose ends and prepare your next steps. You\u2019ve demonstrated that you\u2019re good at wearing that hat for other artists, so you can do it for your songs, too. Just maybe not while you\u2019re in the creative flow.\n\nI\u2019m not practicing what I preach, just brain-dumping. I definitely don\u2019t have this figured out.",

They don't really get stuck anywhere. If something isn't working (even if they suggested it), they're comfortable moving forward. Just forward momentum, very little negative energy.\n\nAnd so much of that is *simply doing it a lot*. It's great to talk about tips and tricks (and yes, morning routines), but mostly it's just putting in time where you're enjoying doing it. \n\nThat's why I think learning songs is so important. It's actually not really about intellectualizing or analyzing what great songs are doing. It's much more just practicing being in the feeling of singing and playing great music. It's the same feeling you're after when you write. By learning great songs and singing them, you get comfortable in that feeling and you're better able to connect to it when writing.",

Instead of doing the only original thing that is possible which is tell your story and express your taste. This is actually much more difficult to do because it's incredibly vulnerable.\n\nYou can compose fully original compositions this way. But it's also interesting how much groundbreaking music comes from direct appropriation of existing popular music. \n\nFrom folk music (\"Blowin In The Wind\" is a melody from another song) to hip hop (all of sampling) to producers and DJs making careers from remixes, playing around with current or past hits can also yield incredible new music.",

Theory is more of a framework for being able to describe and communicate what you're hearing. I wouldn't consider it a pre-req to writing. Just writing and getting in those reps is gonna do it. From there you can look into theory for ways to expand your vocabulary. Plenty of writers get by with nothing more than a rudimentary understanding.",

So I\u2019d start practicing some grooves solo, no click for now, no music. Listen closely to drummers that you love that have that feel throughout songs. Learn their grooves, play along to their songs for a bit.\n\nI think after you take time to play only listening to yourself, and playing along to other songs with a great feel, it\u2019ll be easier to integrate those philosphies into your own productions.\n\nMy drum lessons when I was younger made me stiff and less creative, so finding the right teacher is soooo important. It wasn\u2019t until I played solo to make the drums impactful by themselves, and played along to a ton of hiatus kaiyote and esperanza spalding that i was able to have a musical feel",

Ask yourself what's the mood of the song, what mood am I in. And just kinda flow with it. Like improvising on an instrument. Its a muscle so it will take time and effort. The more often you sit down and improvise melody the easy this will be. Doesn't always have to be a voice exercise. 15 mins of mindless melody exploration on a guitar or piano will stretch the same brain muscles.",

Sometimes I have to let songs brew for a long time, play them out loud a lot, and listen back as an editor with fresh ears before they feel like themselves. Love using these tools to fit that work in while I\u2019m at the grocery store or in the car.",

Than do all the background vocals. \n\nThen start muting a couple of the melody parts. Find my verses.\n\nRinse repeat the process above. But now I know the story and I just have to find the melody and the thru line narrative.\n\nDepending on how the verses feel running into the chorus. Or short length of track.

It's like how perfection doesn't exist. \n\nIt may be easier to think of being a writer on a spectrum from hobbyist to full-time artist. The one end is the hobbyist who does it whenever they want and have time (other priorities take precedent). The other end is the artist who is compelled to do it and it has to turn it off in order to live a normal life.\n\nMost people here are somewhere in between. For most of us, the key is to do a combination of two things:\n\n1. Find every way possible at all times to joyfully write. Direct yourself toward it with how live. Write silly things for fun, have a guitar you like to play next to the place you always like to sit, write emotional things for catharsis, write with other people for the collaborative joy, sing in the shower, write on different instruments that feel inspiring, etc etc \n\n2. The harder part is developing habits and practices that keep you consistent. It's easy to write when it's fun. It's harder to write when it's not fun, and that's the time to make sure you're doing it. Daily practices, schedules, deadlines (self imposed or otherwise) are the best way to do this.",

As a songwriter I have this toolbox of melodic and harmonic approaches  that I can use to solve any problem when making a song, or to have direction to create another section. But recently I've been noticing that something that makes a huge impact on songs is how the different sections relate to the tempo of the track. I think this might not happen to people who write to a beat, but I think that when you are playing an instrument, tempo is so fluid that some parts of a song might \"feel\" good and others won't (at a same tempo). When all the sections flow well into another in terms of tempo (and probably how that affects to vocal delivery) it sucks you in as a listener and it is way more singable/enjoyable. And now I'm starting to see this as a priority more than which notes of the scale have more weight on the chorus and stuff like that.",

    "content": "I deal with (unintentional) inconsistent tempo and some time even time signature/pulse pretty often when working with songwriters and artists. It seems to solve the problem when you tap your feet to the melody. Then you would realize that the tempo has changed. And count 1-2-3-4 or whatever the meter is. So you don\u2019t end up unintentionally having an extra beat because of words and disrupt everything else. A lot of writers ask people for beats first for this reason, but if the melody doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own- relying on the beats will do more harm than good in my opinion. They often end up being mediocre melodies from my experience because there\u2019s already tons of subdivisions and grooves in the beat and the topliner is relying on that to drive the rhythmic feel. But also beats need to come in with pocket so there are space for the vocal melody to fit in. It would be good for writers to start without a beat or instrumentals and it would be good for beatmakers to practice leaving vocal pockets when starting with a beat first",

Great drummers seem to listen to what they're doing as they're playing and learn how \"when I feel [x] as I'm playing, it's translating to [y] in reality\".\n\nThose drummers on those albums (Questlove, Steve Jordan) are phenomenal to listen to for groove and pocket on any of their albums. Others are Jeff Porcaro, Jim Keltner, some newer guys like Nate Smith and Aaron Sterling.",

Or are you mostly just accepting what comes?\n\nI saw a great Bill Evans documentary where he said something along the lines of \u201cjust play what you can, and what you are, do not worry about if it\u2019s complicated/advanced/etc\u2026it\u2019s more authentic to play something simple that you feel than something complicated just for the sake of it\u201d\u2026he was talking about jazz improv but I\u2019ve tied it with much success into my work\u2026when it\u2019s time to go I\u2019m only using things I know intuitively and not trying to force myself to be \u201cbetter\u201d than what I really am in that moment. I set aside other time to raise my skill set/potential with specific things (like scales, but for mastering haha)\n\nJust curious if this kind of stuff is on your mind and something you\u2019re actively pursuing. \n\nI think it ties really deeply into the notion of \u201cjust write\u201d\u2026the skills and good music will come. \n\nBut your perspective is so valuable because you\u2019re working on records with deadlines/commercial implications/expectations/etc",

Her choices are informed by a lifetime of experience and point of view. It's almost ineffable at times. It feels like magic. Poetry is elusive. Most humans can barely do it themselves at that level. Asking these programs to perform at that level is... a lot.\n\nThere's a meme that I came across recently. It was the jazz saxophonist Chris Potter describing how in order to do what he does he has to be practicing at a level that is 10x beyond what he might actually play in a session. In a sense he needs creative and technical headroom to arrive at what the result that the rest of us witness.\n\nSome poetry follows this same principle. It's deeply, deeply ingrained and considered. The best poetry resonates and hints at things that aren't even explicitly mentioned. There's an iceberg of practice and experience beneath the surface of what we see. All Chat GPT sees is the surface. The final results that we're feeding it. It has no conception of the experiences that it's trying to replicate so it's approximations of something so complex and nuanced are likely to fall flat.",

I generally pay more attention to music than words by default, so that might be a factor that plays into it. \n\nTechnically- with drums for example, you can use the same tools, try to play it or sequence it with the feel as close to it as possible, and break down what\u2019s on it in terms of processing. If I go further, I can look at how the drums are interacting with the rest of the ensemble. If I just want to rip off the drums from a song, the first three will pretty much get me there. \n\nD\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo is an album I constantly go back to study for the band interaction. Questlove is usually playing straight eighth notes, and very simple pattern. but how open the hihat is, and where he\u2019s hitting, and when he makes the choices to pop the hihat out or kind of let it hide behind the instrumentation is very interesting. Perhaps subtle spontaneous decisions like that isn\u2019t really replicable but I just take it in physically and try to see why he made this by looking at what other instruments are doing. You can just pay attention to how he plays hi hat and go wild playing just the hat along",

Making stuff on the spot?\nSitting at the computer or sitting together with acoustic guitars beforehand?\nHow long are you hanging before you start writing?\nI find my hangs going pretty long especially on the first write with someone but that usually leads to better lyrical content. However I want to be more intentional with our time without it feeling rushed. \n\nI\u2019m working on my flow and would love some insight into what other people\u2019s process looks like.",

    "content": "A couple of things I always do before and during sessions\n\nHave some things ready to play so collaborators can understand my background, and same with collaborators. I would ask them to play some things they did and grew up listening to so I can understand where they are coming from with decisions or comments they make. \n\nAlways set up so it\u2019s ready to record. have a phone running on record whenever music is played and the computer isn\u2019t recording\n\nHave a few small incomplete ideas at disposal before walking into the sessions. Could be a simple guitar chord progression with a little something on top, could be riff or banging drum patterns. Important thing here for me is to continue moving on to next ideas if I don\u2019t get an immediate response (which is usually singing on top) and continue to work my way into it. \n\nI like to have full drums ready to go somewhere on my computer. So I can just import it in, and it will get people moving. Splice drum loops are fine too. Some sort of instant vibe is needed in my experience. Splice really helps with that, because then you don\u2019t have people looking at the back of your head trying to dial in drums or synth patch for more than 5 minutes.",

It\u2018s easier rn for me though bc I\u2018m still at uni so I work with people I know well and tjey dont have to pay me for studio time. \nBut usually we\u2018d start an idea and once we agree on a vibe I\u2018d start laying down some drums or instrument\nFor me the most important thing is always to be super aware of what the artist is doing and really be attentive towards any good ideas they come up with while they\u2018re in the flow \nLike picking up on a small lyric idea they might be mumbling stream of conciousness style but might be a great overall concept",

Back then I hated it but looking back it\u2018s fascinating that at every club I went to people who might not have been musically inclined at all could sing along every word of the songs of that era, think Hangover, DJ got us falling in love, all the avicii stuff even levels which is mostly instrumental. There seemed to have been something magical about those lyrics and that particular kind of songwriting that really resonated with people and created an unbeblievable sense of unity. If you\u2018ve ever been in a club with hundreds of people singing along to Hangover on the top of their lungs you know what I mean. Raw power. It\u2018s easy to dismiss those songs as stupid but there seems to be something primal about them that really connects with people",

Regardless, one of my good friends and I have committed to a sort of \"exposure therapy\" in getting together once a week or so to make stuff. My friend is an excellent guitar player and we've worked together in various capacities for a long time, but every time we get together the stuff he brings to the table is just balls out riffs and fanciful effects/tone that don't really translate to a seedling of a song. I have a hard time hearing where to take things or having a clear feeling about the sounds.",

    "content": "Do the songwriters get paid to create those demos?  No...  but they often PAY OTHERS to help them make the demo possible.  Nashville folk will often have \"Demo Days\" where a group of Ace players charge a flat fee to perform and record the rhythm section (for instance, could be anything the song needs). They might record 5-10 tracks in a day. I'm sure some have done more. These \"demo day tracks\" are used by songwriters to then pitch their track to recording artists, labels, anyone.  There's also a whole army of producers ready to help songwriters demo-up...  where the songwriter pays a producer to turnkey the track.  Sometimes it's one guy playing everything or a few remote players all chipping in under the producers direction.  \n\nAnd...  these are viewed as a \"very basic demo\" in the eyes of industry vets. A really good \"one take\" by great players with high quality equipment recording the basic tracks is a strong demo but not fully produced. Happens all the time, but the producer (and their team) gets paid by the songwriter (or their team) to produce the track.",

But, I have a friend who is a super prolific writer. He has his own artist project which I\u2019ve produced/mixed, and a few years ago had a publishing deal and has a good deal of writing credits. We\u2019re a really good yin/yang pair: he\u2019s focused on melody/lyrics/chords, I\u2019m focused on rhythm/sounds/texture/mix. We have a co-credit for a Suki Waterhouse song for the one and only explicitly \u201cwriting session\u201d we\u2019ve done together.\n\nI just reconnected with him and mentioned that I\u2019m about to be in a position where I could do more open-ended writing (/spec production?) sessions and would love to work with him again\u2014specifically on some projects that have approached me more in the writing stages, and most especially on reaching for bigger artists. And he\u2019s down!\n\nHere are my questions (and this is a *total* explain it to me like I\u2019m five situation\u2014I\u2019ve really struggled to make sense of things business/session flow-wise outside of getting paid for a discrete deliverable or a day rate):\n\nI don\u2019t feel a need to be too formal about things right now, but is this sort of partnership where we could pursue a joint publishing deal?\n\nMy main motivation is two-fold: keep a foot in production/engineering while I\u2019ve leaned more and more into mixing recently, and use our credits to get in a room with bigger artists. Am I way off here?\n\nAnything I\u2019m missing/obviously oblivious to?",
