    "content": "If you're trying to be a highly successful professional, you should do all of these things and be prepared to adjust on the fly.\n\nI pretty much always have full songs, tracks, hooks, and concepts prepared. Much of the time, you won't use any of them on any given day. But good news: they're useful for future days.\n\nI've had all of that prepared and then the artist and I just chat for five hours, then write a song on a piano.\n\nI've had all that prepared and then cut song after song because the artist goes \"what else do you have???\"\n\nAnecdote that might be helpful: I've been in with an artist all week. Me, another producer/writer, and her. The other producer/writer has his rig set up and he also writes topline. We usually bounce back and forth depending on what the song requires. We've all worked together before and we had the whole week blocked out so there's no pressure to perform on day one. But we did three songs on the first day because she just came in firing. The first song she came in with a title and we worked from scratch and knocked it out in an hour. The other producer made the track quick with some existing drum loops he had prepped for her, adding keys and horns as we wrote. Then she asked \"do you have anything to play?\" I played her a track hook I had prepared. She liked it and we powered through that one in another hour. Then we broke for lunch. We caught up. As we were finishing she mentioned this one kinda stupid and sassy idea she tried to bring into another session but the producers didn't like it. So we wrote that one and it was fire. I tapped out a tempo as she rapped the hook idea and just make a skeleton beat on the fly.\n\nBeing way over prepared is rarely going to hurt you.",

    "content": "I always tailor it to the artist in some way. It's a combination of making fresh ideas specifically for them and taking existing ideas that could work (sometimes reworking existing ideas). I never go into a session like an actual blind date where I don't know anything about them.\n\nThe challenge is always do I make something that sounds like what they've done, or do I make something that sounds like where they're going? That's impossible to answer. I've had success in major label POP artist sessions by having a 100 year old piano and specifically not playing tracks. Meaning, you never know if an artist is tired of doing the same shit. Because I have confidence in my skill as a producer, I'm happy to get an A+ ballad because I know I can turn it into whatever production I want. \"In The Name Of Love\" is my most successful example of this. It's an emotional 3 chord piano ballad that was produced into a festival EDM anthem. \n\nI've had the most success being prepared for all options. Mostly because that makes me flexible for what an artist is feeling that day, but also because the more stuff I make, the more music I'm making. If I prep for a session, I'm not working cold. The prep is also like a psychological and creative warm up for me. Prep makes me a better improviser.",

I\u2019m in mastering now, so while I do a lot of collaboration it\u2019s not quite what you\u2019re getting at here but I\u2019ve got a decent amount of experience in the room/tracking/producing. \n\nTo me it is a matter of developing trust and belief with another person. My approach is to be brutally honest with people and let the chips fall where they may. When things are amazing, meh, or bad. As @BatMeckley said\u2026you want the $10k mic. Don\u2019t waste the time with anything in the middle.\n\nSo in short \u2014 I\u2019d just tell them exactly what you wrote above. But I tend to be more on the extremes \u2014 I\u2019d like to think that people come away from working with me with a deep-seated belief in themselves and their potential but also honest feedback about very specific things we can do better. I actively seek to challenge my collaborators (which I\u2019m sure you do as well). I\u2019ve found people really respond to this if it\u2019s done with the clear intention to help both of us improve and with the curiosity of the potential in the art!\n\nIn short, I\u2019m an extreme encourager but also a harsh critic (in a kind way). I never let someone give up on themselves if I can help it and show love for them by very specifically calling out how I recognize their potential but see areas for improvement!\n\nI feel that I\u2019ve always been able to tell when people do things like \u201clead with a compliment\u201d or whatever. So that\u2019s my POV on this whole topic\u2026I just like people to be straight with me. When I have dealt with artists who clearly need the validation you\u2019re speaking about\u2026.I\u2019ll specifically call it out with something like \u201cstop looking for validation you have the talent to do this now start believing in yourself\u201d\u2026etc. Seems sort of harsh but it really can cut to the chase and open up a deeper level of trust and communication.\n\nSometimes people don\u2019t like this\u2026and that\u2019s all good too. Always lead with kindness and things work out. Depth > quantity",

Understand that it's ok to figure out what a song means after you write it.\n\n5. Understand that we're trying to make trees, not tables.

Said it already but saying it again, don't check your phone before you write\n\n7. I don't always write lyrics. Sometimes i write a melody, sometimes a chord progression, sometimes lyrics. Every now and then i do a session of what i call Lego writing, where i try to see what lyrics i wrote before fit with what melody/chord progression etc. \n\n8. Oh and did i mention, it ruins my creativity to check my phone before i make anything? \n\nThis is what works for me, hope it helps you!",

    "content": "I\u2019m sure we all share this struggle to some degree. I\u2019ve got some projects that I\u2019ve put many hours into, just to let them sit on a hard drive for years.\n\nCo-writing has helped a lot, and has taken some ideas to places I never would have thought to go. The feeling that you have some moral obligation to your collaborators to finish is motivating. When you\u2019re making art for yourself, it doesn\u2019t benefit from those positive forces of peer pressure, and there\u2019s a lack of constraints and no sense of urgency. \n\nI think making creative decisions is metabolically expensive. It\u2019s easier to defer all decisions, which is why you see DAW-age producers committing to so little until the mix. In the same way you can defer the entire songwriting process, especially if you have someone else\u2019s project or deadline to prioritize over your own.\n\nTo be both the creative mind and the executive finisher is a lot of exhausting context switching. Some options might be to split these responsibilities with someone else, or to dedicate separate time to each task. If someone hires me to print stems or solder a patchbay, the last thing I want to do is engage in creativity. But when I get inspired to write, I don\u2019t want to stop and troubleshoot the plug-in that\u2019s crashing the session.\n\nMaybe like the divergence/convergence approach would be to set aside an hour or three at the end of your day to finish ideas you\u2019ve already got brewing\u2014set a timer and finish a song, or a verse. Or, even better yet, dedicate the *end* of your day to play and experimentation. Then the next morning, hopefully with fresh perspective, get in the mood to tie up loose ends and prepare your next steps. You\u2019ve demonstrated that you\u2019re good at wearing that hat for other artists, so you can do it for your songs, too. Just maybe not while you\u2019re in the creative flow.\n\nI\u2019m not practicing what I preach, just brain-dumping. I definitely don\u2019t have this figured out.",

    "content": "This is a little of the top of my head, but I'll try and break it down like this. You're mostly going to get work/ collaborators for three reasons. \n\nThe #1 is your work (great songs, in this case). If you make great shit, people will either hear it and reach out, or when you meet someone, you'll send each other things and they'll love your work and want to be a part of what you can do. no matter where you are in your career, this is #1 always always always. When I was starting out, I produced some of the best sounding records for local bands, so other local bands wanted to work with me. Now, I (or my manager, or my publisher) can send a spotify playlist with songs people know, and that helps get me gigs.\n\n#2 is making shit with people you know personally. This is the best way to do it starting out since you don't have lots of great work out in the world. You need a little community of friends that you make shit with. I guess a lot of that will start moving online, but still the vast majority of great work gets done in person. Even during the pandemic, despite all the zoom writing session and remote work, most great stuff was still getting done in person. You gotta find your people and make things. Then you have the advantage of multiple people promoting your work.\n\n#3 is the pure cold call hustle. It's TOUGH. It's a low percentage game no matter what you're trying to do (be it mixing or writing or producing or being an artist). You have to understand that you may get 1% response rate from people. It's not to say it doesn't have value, but if you want responses, you have to have a good pitch and sending out thousands of messages. But the other thing about this is that writing songs remotely frankly fucking sucks compared to doing it in person. Songwriting is such an in the moment emotional thing. Producing and mixing remotely is very very different that doing real time creative vulnerability. This #3 applies more to non-songwriting collaborations than anything else.",

Unfortunately being in London almost 100% of my work has been remote, I\u2019ve found myself tracking drums, bass, vocals, trumpet etc all using AudioMovers and while it\u2019s great to finish projects I agree with you that it\u2019s way better to do any or all of the above in person.\n\nThat said maybe the cold call/ intro is more like a \u201chey, here is some of my stuff, let\u2019s jump on a zoom call, if you don\u2019t hate me in the first 30 mins come hang at the studio for a day\u201d \n\nThat all said, if anyone on here wants to jump on and do a session hit me up \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks again Matt, even more keen to push forward now!",

Scared of exposing myself and what i'm feeling even to the cowriters or people that I'm sharing music with. Fuck, and I'm even shy about sharing it with my girlfriend and my family. Slowly growing out of it by training myself to be emotionally honest and vulnerable.

If I\u2019m writing with someone who doesn\u2019t trust themselves as much or doesn\u2019t feel comfortable leading a session because they\u2019re pretty new to writing, I\u2019ll try to be more of an active guide rather than a sounding board. I\u2019ve also had people who get embarassed to write in front of others so I\u2019ll just chill on my phone on the porch for them lmao. \n\nI think people who are writers and producers struggle to collaborator with that middle ground between seasoned pro/artist with very clear vision, and very \u201cgreen\u201d artist. They won\u2019t feel comfortable having someone write a whole song for them but they don\u2019t quite trust their own judgement yet either. I think the solution is to practice the idea of commitment.  Sometimes the best writing contribution is letting them do a lot of the lifting, and if the artist gets insecure or flustered, just ask them \u201cwell, how do you feel about the idea/line?\u201d or \u201cwhat about the line feels awkward?\u201d That way you\u2019re helping them to actually make decisions\u2014now they\u2019ll be able to write with you or anyone else, or completely solo.",

I mean really pull apart one of my songs word for word. Have you ever offered up one of your songs for that experience?\n\nPerhaps the most value you can add is by looking at the song out of context, with fresh ears and no bias, and just determine whether or not the writer\u2019s intention is clear and cohesive.\n\nIt\u2019s a thing close to the heart, so you have to approach it with care (kinda like vocal producing). I can\u2019t think of a time that I\u2019ve ever offered lyrical input if a song I\u2019m producing. It would have to be really detracting from the message.\n\nIt\u2019s another thing altogether when you\u2019re *invited* to offer a critique or help finish an idea\u2026although sometimes I find that the invitation isn\u2019t always an indication of open mindedness.",

    "content": "When I was on a song by song basis, I needed to be ensconced and fixated or feel \u201cdrawn\u201d hard to work on an idea, and once I started I need to see it though to the end. I also never slept well, needed to adjust tons of deadlines, and so I started to change things up. In some ways, feeling the urge to make moments happen is still part of how I work but I view my writing sessions as flexing the muscles rather than ideas until I know I have that feeling or moment where I am drawn to create, on top of whatever sessions I have. \n\nSo nowadays, my strategy lately has been to change my goal orientation. Rather than thinking about my output in songs or ideas, I think about just trying to get myself into a creative rhythm and a flow state. If I ride my time out further than that, that\u2019s awesome, but I try to make sure I have 3-4 hours a week of quality \u201cflowing\u201d writing time.",

This might be a hot take but it\u2019s what works for me: If they\u2019re totally stoked about it you need to be stoked too. Just as stoked. Just fake it if you need to, ~especially~ in the early writing stages. You can always go back and revisit ideas, but once someone feels like their enthusiasm and creativity and taste is being questioned, it takes forever to rebuild that trust. Mirror their emotions, get excited, be specific. THEN, once you have established the kinship and spent your own time living with the idea and better understanding what would improve it, you can bring up \u201chey I was thinking and I have some ideas that might be able to make what you created hit even more!\u201d",

He is well known as a detail oriented, vocal-focused pop savant. He is often a part of every choice from writing lyrics and melody all the way to adjusting sibilance in the mix. His instincts for great melody and rhythm, paired with lyrics that sound good, is unmatched. And I say \"sound good,\" because though I think many of the lyrics of his songs are meaningful (especially with the best lyric co-writers), the choice of words and how they are emphasized and enunciated is what separates him from everyone else. It's like Michael Jackson. \n\nDo some YouTube searching on artists talking about working with Max Martin. You can learn a LOT about writing vocal from him.",

It's like how perfection doesn't exist. \n\nIt may be easier to think of being a writer on a spectrum from hobbyist to full-time artist. The one end is the hobbyist who does it whenever they want and have time (other priorities take precedent). The other end is the artist who is compelled to do it and it has to turn it off in order to live a normal life.\n\nMost people here are somewhere in between. For most of us, the key is to do a combination of two things:\n\n1. Find every way possible at all times to joyfully write. Direct yourself toward it with how live. Write silly things for fun, have a guitar you like to play next to the place you always like to sit, write emotional things for catharsis, write with other people for the collaborative joy, sing in the shower, write on different instruments that feel inspiring, etc etc \n\n2. The harder part is developing habits and practices that keep you consistent. It's easy to write when it's fun. It's harder to write when it's not fun, and that's the time to make sure you're doing it. Daily practices, schedules, deadlines (self imposed or otherwise) are the best way to do this.",

    "content": "I deal with (unintentional) inconsistent tempo and some time even time signature/pulse pretty often when working with songwriters and artists. It seems to solve the problem when you tap your feet to the melody. Then you would realize that the tempo has changed. And count 1-2-3-4 or whatever the meter is. So you don\u2019t end up unintentionally having an extra beat because of words and disrupt everything else. A lot of writers ask people for beats first for this reason, but if the melody doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own- relying on the beats will do more harm than good in my opinion. They often end up being mediocre melodies from my experience because there\u2019s already tons of subdivisions and grooves in the beat and the topliner is relying on that to drive the rhythmic feel. But also beats need to come in with pocket so there are space for the vocal melody to fit in. It would be good for writers to start without a beat or instrumentals and it would be good for beatmakers to practice leaving vocal pockets when starting with a beat first",

Could be a simple guitar chord progression with a little something on top, could be riff or banging drum patterns. Important thing here for me is to continue moving on to next ideas if I don\u2019t get an immediate response (which is usually singing on top) and continue to work my way into it. \n\nI like to have full drums ready to go somewhere on my computer. So I can just import it in, and it will get people moving. Splice drum loops are fine too. Some sort of instant vibe is needed in my experience. Splice really helps with that, because then you don\u2019t have people looking at the back of your head trying to dial in drums or synth patch for more than 5 minutes.",

If you are more lyrics person, I think you can get a lot of value out of hanging out. \n\nFirst thing is creating safe space- and it really depends on person to person. Some people never open up, some people can open up immediately. In my experience, the more experienced they are - the more they tend to be the latter. I think how much time you spend on it can be dependent on this. You mentioned wanting to be more intentional, one idea that came to my mind is communicating this from the get go. Obviously there are going to be times where bring this up can be weird in the beginning of the session, but it should get them to think about opening up as part of work at the very least. It needs to be done carefully of course\n\nThe other part of it is understanding the person themselves. Their general vibe and energy. It\u2019s easier to tell with some folks, and it\u2019s harder to know what kind of person it is with some other folks. regarding this, I find diving into work right away helps feel it out. my job is often to constantly create ideas and inspirations. I can often gather some information from how they respond to different ideas. \n\nLastly, I used to spend a lot of time hanging up until very recently and I found it\u2019s so much more productive to just work and bond through that experience. Nature of work calls for connecting on a personal level, but it doesn\u2019t require it. I\u2019ve been trying to take it easy on getting closer with people, and focusing on the overall experience of collaboration and it has been making sessions more productive. So I plan on sticking with this way for a bit and see how it goes!",

I have this happen often when it\u2018s just me and an artist where I have to two do jobs at once (producing/writing) and only having limited capacity for the artist to bounce ideas off me when I\u2018m working in the track \n\nTalking about this feeling when your head gets heavy/almost like a pressure behind your eyes where nothing will come out \n\nUsually I just take a break but I\u2018m curious if there are methods that are more efficient and wont make us lose time",

Also could be nice to hear if the same can be done during production stage ? let me know your experiences !",

    "content": "I circled around some of these ideas a few years ago here, but now I\u2019m more seriously thinking/asking for advice\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve never written a song in my life, and don\u2019t have any real desire to do so (more than happy to be mixer/producer/drummer/multi-instrumentalist guy). But, I have a friend who is a super prolific writer. He has his own artist project which I\u2019ve produced/mixed, and a few years ago had a publishing deal and has a good deal of writing credits. We\u2019re a really good yin/yang pair: he\u2019s focused on melody/lyrics/chords, I\u2019m focused on rhythm/sounds/texture/mix. We have a co-credit for a Suki Waterhouse song for the one and only explicitly \u201cwriting session\u201d we\u2019ve done together.\n\nI just reconnected with him and mentioned that I\u2019m about to be in a position where I could do more open-ended writing (/spec production?) sessions and would love to work with him again\u2014specifically on some projects that have approached me more in the writing stages, and most especially on reaching for bigger artists. And he\u2019s down!\n\nHere are my questions (and this is a *total* explain it to me like I\u2019m five situation\u2014I\u2019ve really struggled to make sense of things business/session flow-wise outside of getting paid for a discrete deliverable or a day rate):\n\nI don\u2019t feel a need to be too formal about things right now, but is this sort of partnership where we could pursue a joint publishing deal?\n\nMy main motivation is two-fold: keep a foot in production/engineering while I\u2019ve leaned more and more into mixing recently, and use our credits to get in a room with bigger artists. Am I way off here?\n\nAnything I\u2019m missing/obviously oblivious to?",

    "content": "The short answer is: you're a songwriter now too. This is a new part of your professional repertoire. This is great.\n\nI made a similar transition from producing bands to doing co-writing sessions as a producer. You can still get hired as a producer or engineer (as I still do), but writing sessions are structured with different expectations and potential outcomes. \n\nWhen you participate in songwriting sessions, you are almost never getting paid up front as an engineer or producer. There are some cases where super rich people will pay for songwriting sessions, or artist with bigger budgets might get their label to pay a studio fee, but this will be a tiny minority of your writing sessions. \n\nPhilosophically, the idea is that you're all creating something together that, if it's good enough, it will be released into the world in someway. But your experimenting and will make many ideas that don't cross that threshold. However, if any of the recordings of these song come out you will still get paid as a producer (/ engineer / mixer / whatever else you do on the final version). If no peace of the recording that you made when the song was written gets used, you will still participate as a songwriter on the copyright.",

I actually got hit up by an artist this morning to schedule something for this exact co-writing thing\u2014that and this response are good motivation to keep after this avenue of work!\n\nYes, role so far has been sounding board/musicianship/engineering and mixing/producing/providing studio. I can\u2019t remember the split but on the Suki song he did get a bigger cut. I got a production fee when it made the album and it all felt fair to me. It\u2019s registered with a PRO.",

A stem ripper . \nI didn\u2019t want to say in my OG post much more so as to not bias a potential interpretation of Louie bells process , but what I was struck by was the simple brutal idea of just taking the proven best elements of others work as a foundation to begin building your own frameworks . \nWe ve spoken about it before in other channels with regard to using a  sample to write to and ditching it later , or reconstructing a track and letting it become something new \u2026..I\u2019d not thought of or heard of simply ripping hundreds of classic drums and taking them into a writing session before though . \nThere\u2019s something so abrupt and utilitarian about that approach that I felt it might be helpful to anyone who is struggling with their own process , should they be trying to write all from scratch",

    "content": "And if you don\u2019t wanna go buying books, I\u2019d recommend possibly trying out the daily practice of object writing; you could even try it for a week or so, and you\u2019ll end up getting interesting imagery, some of which you may be able to use in your songs - but if you stick at it a bit (I find if I do it solidly in the mornings for a week or two it just warms my brain right up for writing throughout the day) it can help get your brain into that mode, so that when you go into your writing sessions later, your brain is already making those connections. Just an option of course - everyone\u2019s got their own way with lyric, it really is so personal. Whatever tools help, use em, whatever tools don\u2019t, chuck em. \n\nI just mention these things bc you talk about making the songs \u2018real\u2019, and I feel that - I love trying to get a song to feel properly grounded, with a sense of place and reality. Best solution I\u2019ve found is to just leave a bit of me in there - somehow it\u2019s like people can feel when songwriting is \u2018real\u2019, so I just try to make sure my heart is in/behind each line, keep them smooth, rinse repeat \n\nWould love to crack open this topic again too, curious on more peoples thoughts on this stuff, thanks for opening this up  @OJ,",

Any tips or workflow things you can recommend? \n\nAbleton has usually been home base for this, I see it as a flexible scratch pad to throw down parts while the artist and 3rd are going in on lyrics.

    "content": "i guess other forms of art like film or books often do require a lot of structure and thought in order to cohesively convey or execute a vision... even if the vision is fundamentally grounded on a seed of feeling or very specific idea. songs and music are so temporal and intuitive that it doesnt really require that necessarily. \n\nfor better and worse, i tend to have this desire to seek out a 'scientific' nature in things. for me as a fan of films, i can often decipher or intuit the internal logic and intentionality that choreographs lights and angles and framing to create a moving feeling/painting. \n\ni do fully agree that fundamentally the only thing that can create this sense of 'spatial awareness' in a medium, or a sense of dialectic/causality between the subtle and intuitive, creative elements is experience and repetition; but i can't help but seek out knowledge or structure/self critique to my approach.\n\ni think to that end, i should collaborate more with people who are experienced so i can accelerate my own learning if that's what i seek. i find myself always searching for this 'internal' awareness of intentionality, searching for the forces and patterns that make a system or experience exist and change how they do.\n\ni am alwasy looking for this feeling of purpose or understanding of which steps are wanted/needed for me to take what ive created closer to its essence or my original vision. i think people understand this at the level of more technical creative aspects... for example mixing. ultimately the art is still to have a creative vision and executing that, but it's the experience and awareness to have intentionality and wisdom in how to execute that separates raw creativity/talent from a professional level of execution no? I think the same can be applied to more abstract skills like writing/songwriting.\n\ni'm going to commit to writing new material everyday for a month and see what happens!",
