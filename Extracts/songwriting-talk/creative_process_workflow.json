After some discussion we've instituted a new forum #song-a-week for what will be the first of a weekly songwriting exercise that we now invite you to participate in.\n\nThis is an opportunity to flex your songwriting muscles and share your work with your peers. Every Sunday evening we'll pick a songwriting prompt for the coming week. It may be a theme, or perhaps a popular song that we'll all use as a jumping-off point for inspiration. Participants will have between Monday and Fri of the following week to write and share their song demo. Then we do it all over again the following week.\n\nThe forum is located right beneath #\u270dsongwriting-talk on the channel sidebar. Everyone is welcome to participate starting tomorrow (Monday).",

(recently it's been Tom Petty Wildflowers at the piano). Then I look at my phone and start my day.\n\nHard to know for sure if it's causal, but my songwriting abilities have sped up. I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks. \n\nI think it's related to several aspects of the morning routine, and they all compound. \n\n*I'm playing music before I'm on my phone, so I'm outputting music before my brain starts reacting.\n\n*doing scales w piano and voice opens up my vocabulary on both instruments and makes me much more comfortable to sing/play ideas when writing\n*doing these to a metronome has improved my timing on all instruments (not just piano and vocal)\n*learning a great song and singing it every morning has massively improved my lyrical writing/ improvisation (probably the hardest part of songwriting) by just reinforcing good *sounding* words.\n*singing and recording the same song every morning for a few days or a week makes me really THINK about vocals and vocal production. How I'm singing the words, how to push certain vowels in a certain part of my voice, etc \n\n@Slow Hand  @Ross Fortune @Will Melones @OJ",

    "content": "Yes exactly! I've found that the best songs are never calculated, they're always just felt as they're being created. They are magical/ incalculable moments. As soon as people start analyzing \u2013 \"is this too generic?\" \"maybe we should have a part like **insert artist**\" \u2013 the songs loses its magic.\n\nBut the paradox is that you can't  just sit around and wait for them to happen. You have to be in motion. So often times building habits and processes (which are calculated) is a great way to keep oneself in the motion of creating things. Piano scales, learning songs, writing a song a day, etc., are just some of the many ways to do this.\n\nAnd the other aspect is also correct. These are skill building exercises that help the quick translation of creative ideas. It's the emotional and psychological side of workflow. Just like technical workflow \u2013 where you want the shortest time between idea an execution \u2013 same goes for writing. If you are constantly writing lyrics and singing melodies and playing instruments, when that emotional magical idea arrives, you can translate it more quickly into lyrics, melody, and music.",

    "content": "Depending on the kind of wall that you\u2019re hitting with her, there are a few simple approaches that you can suggest that will get her thinking about the different dimensions of melody and how to play with it:\n\nA) Expansion - How long is the melody? It is a small fragment, or a full sentence? Stretch it out over a longer period of time. Sing it half as fast. Hold certain notes for emphasis.\n\nB) Diminution - Compress parts of the melody into faster runs. Make it shorter. Remove notes. Simplify the melody to its melodic essence.\n\nC) Repetition - Take a fragment of the melody and play it again. And again. And again.\n\nD) Modulation - Take a melodic idea and transpose it to different keys. The first movement of Beethoven\u2019s 5th Symphony is built entirely off of a simple four-note motif. He got a lot of mileage from such a small element.\n\nE) Dynamics - Play with volume or intensity. Encourage her to go from soft to loud, or loud to soft. Accent certain notes for emphasis. This one is really powerful. For inspiration suggest that she try voicing her dynamics like a great horn player might. Get her to clip her notes very short or to make them \u201cbloom\u201d or be soft and round. Make them bark or be breathy.\n\nF) Be Another Instrument - Encourage her to try writing as another instrument with her voice. Sing a bass line. Sing a horn part. Sing percussively like Michael Jackson or James Brown would.\n\nG) Role Playing - Give her a character and a persona to inhabit. Make her sing the same thing as different personalities or people. Pick a melody and then make her sing it in the style of three singers that she\u2019d know.",

Almost everyone I know, and seemingly everyone that asks questions here, just needs to write lyrics and melody over and over and over.\n\nIf you want to get reps to become a producer, that's awesome. Go to #\ud83c\udfb9production-talk and talk about those reps.\n\nTrying to also do production while doing the exercises that we're talking about will only slow you down.",

So what is meaning for you? \n\nDo you like making things? Do you enjoy the process? Do you feel fulfilled and connected to the experience of life by playing piano or singing or mixing or making weird keyboard sounds? \n\nI love all that shit so much. When I get stressed out and uninspired, I try to find the ways to get me back into making things. When I do, I always feel better. Piano scales or learning songs or playing guitar for my girlfriend or whatever it is that makes me feel joy.\n\nIt's very important for me to have significant parts of my life that are creative and not for any purpose.",

Limit yourself, set a timer, write a song - what words do they use? Listen to a few songs of theirs first and notice what stories they\u2019re interested in telling. I find even if I don\u2019t end up writing a song in their style at all by the end (usually the case) the exercise gets me thinking about the stories I have rolling around my head. Ideas I wouldn\u2019t have thought of as being good for a song. Gets me out of writing the same song too many times, and always makes me realise we have way more songs in us than we thought. Make a weapon out of your empathy and have fun - you can step into anyone\u2019s shoes and try thinking what song you might write if you were there. (The fun challenge is to STLL keep it genuine and authentic to you - kind of paradoxical but I believe heavily in amazing stuff being able to come this way)",

Choose an interval of time that you want to spend practicing a song (10 min, 15 min, 20 min) and practice Song #1 for that amount of time. Then - even if you're not proficient or haven't yet committed the song to memory - move on to practicing Song #2 and let the first song process and consolidate in your memory while you work on Song #2. \n\nWash, rinse, repeat until you go through the entire rotation of songs.  If some songs are significantly more difficult to learn or memorize then come back to them more often.

I\u2019ve got some projects that I\u2019ve put many hours into, just to let them sit on a hard drive for years.\n\nCo-writing has helped a lot, and has taken some ideas to places I never would have thought to go. The feeling that you have some moral obligation to your collaborators to finish is motivating. When you\u2019re making art for yourself, it doesn\u2019t benefit from those positive forces of peer pressure, and there\u2019s a lack of constraints and no sense of urgency. \n\nI think making creative decisions is metabolically expensive. It\u2019s easier to defer all decisions, which is why you see DAW-age producers committing to so little until the mix. In the same way you can defer the entire songwriting process, especially if you have someone else\u2019s project or deadline to prioritize over your own.\n\nTo be both the creative mind and the executive finisher is a lot of exhausting context switching. Some options might be to split these responsibilities with someone else, or to dedicate separate time to each task. If someone hires me to print stems or solder a patchbay, the last thing I want to do is engage in creativity. But when I get inspired to write, I don\u2019t want to stop and troubleshoot the plug-in that\u2019s crashing the session.\n\nMaybe like the divergence/convergence approach would be to set aside an hour or three at the end of your day to finish ideas you\u2019ve already got brewing\u2014set a timer and finish a song, or a verse. Or, even better yet, dedicate the *end* of your day to play and experimentation. Then the next morning, hopefully with fresh perspective, get in the mood to tie up loose ends and prepare your next steps. You\u2019ve demonstrated that you\u2019re good at wearing that hat for other artists, so you can do it for your songs, too. Just maybe not while you\u2019re in the creative flow.\n\nI\u2019m not practicing what I preach, just brain-dumping. I definitely don\u2019t have this figured out.",

No agonizing over lyrics or Melodies or whatever, if it rhymes and makes some kind of sense, move on with it. \n2) first year: ever song needed a key change or modal shift. Second year: shifting or alt time signatures. Third year: some other esoteric tool I wanted to learn etc\u2026\n3) the moment you\u2019re done, record a voice memo and send it to someone.

    "content": "The other overall point to make is that I find nearly all the great songwriters I know are just comfortable in a session. \"Good vibes\" in a sense, but also just comfortable generating ideas. They don't really get stuck anywhere. If something isn't working (even if they suggested it), they're comfortable moving forward. Just forward momentum, very little negative energy.\n\nAnd so much of that is *simply doing it a lot*. It's great to talk about tips and tricks (and yes, morning routines), but mostly it's just putting in time where you're enjoying doing it. \n\nThat's why I think learning songs is so important. It's actually not really about intellectualizing or analyzing what great songs are doing. It's much more just practicing being in the feeling of singing and playing great music. It's the same feeling you're after when you write. By learning great songs and singing them, you get comfortable in that feeling and you're better able to connect to it when writing.",

The point is to relieve yourself of any editing and force yourself to quickly write lyrics and melodies. \n\nIt's doing two separate and important things: building muscle memory and teaching to work on instinct.\n\nBuilding songwriting muscle memory is just like learning a language. You're practicing over and over until you learn how to express yourself emotionally. This is the basics component. You'll learn what notes you can hit and what words rhyme and how rhythms bounce. You'll build a foundation that will become second nature.\n\nRelated but distinct, you will learn how to move quickly. It turns out most great songs come in an unthinking way. Until you learn how to write without editing and thinking about what you're doing, you are less likely to write those great songs.\n\nI'm speaking from a lot of personal experience, but also whether it's Hemmingway's \"write drunk edit sober,\" or the Rick Rubin, Pharrell, etc. belief that great songs come from some power outside of ourselves (\"Source\" or God or whatever), learning to create without being analytical is super super important.",

It's like the language of an instrument or a literal spoken language.\n\nAny books, tips, videos, classes, spiritual paths, etc etc are only useful right now if they get you to write MORE. But really, you do not need them. I strongly disagree with anyone who says otherwise.\n\nFWIW, my 25 years, billions of streams, platinum hit songs, blah blah has taught me that reps are the ONLY foundation. The best songwriters write all the time and didn't really get good until they'd written hundreds to thousands of songs.\n\n@Zack Hames is on the right track. But don't \"attempt\" to write a song a day. Force yourself to do it. Immerse like you would learning a language. Don't wait to express yourself perfectly, start writing songs like a five-year-old and work your way up. \n\nUnlike mixing where you need to learn how things like compression work, or like playing guitar where it's important to have someone show you proper technique, you cannot learn how to be a great songwriter by anything other than doing it over and over*.",

Sometimes i just grab the idea for a hook from a portion of the top line that I already did, I just change it a bit, make loads of variants of that motive. Or just move around the key of the song and get a lot of options. You know what i mean? Its hard to explain by writing\ud83d\ude02But its just trial and error tbh.

If I\u2019m writing with someone who doesn\u2019t trust themselves as much or doesn\u2019t feel comfortable leading a session because they\u2019re pretty new to writing, I\u2019ll try to be more of an active guide rather than a sounding board. I\u2019ve also had people who get embarassed to write in front of others so I\u2019ll just chill on my phone on the porch for them lmao. \n\nI think people who are writers and producers struggle to collaborator with that middle ground between seasoned pro/artist with very clear vision, and very \u201cgreen\u201d artist. They won\u2019t feel comfortable having someone write a whole song for them but they don\u2019t quite trust their own judgement yet either. I think the solution is to practice the idea of commitment.  Sometimes the best writing contribution is letting them do a lot of the lifting, and if the artist gets insecure or flustered, just ask them \u201cwell, how do you feel about the idea/line?\u201d or \u201cwhat about the line feels awkward?\u201d That way you\u2019re helping them to actually make decisions\u2014now they\u2019ll be able to write with you or anyone else, or completely solo.",

Ask yourself what's the mood of the song, what mood am I in. And just kinda flow with it. Like improvising on an instrument. Its a muscle so it will take time and effort. The more often you sit down and improvise melody the easy this will be. Doesn't always have to be a voice exercise. 15 mins of mindless melody exploration on a guitar or piano will stretch the same brain muscles.",

But mostly drums first.\n\nBuild an instrumental just chasing intuition, quickly. 2-3 melody parts and a bass line on top of drums. And youve got a chorus loop. \n\nThen take that improvisational melody muscle and apply it to the vocal melody. \n\nIm not a big humming guy, I get to words pretty quickly. But will start with common phrases to me like,  \"runnin runnin runnin round runnin runnin runnin down\" I have a few others.\n\nI start to land on a melody, with a feeling and story. That I haven't told. Sometimes it takes 90 seconds, sometimes 5-10 mins. \n\nRecord and comp till I have what I like. Than do all the background vocals. \n\nThen start muting a couple of the melody parts. Find my verses.\n\nRinse repeat the process above. But now I know the story and I just have to find the melody and the thru line narrative.\n\nDepending on how the verses feel running into the chorus. Or short length of track. I'll write a bridge \n\nMelodyne the vocals.\n\nStructure the song.\n\nMix the song.\n\nUpload the song.\n\nMake another.\n\nThis usually takes 2-4 days, intermittent with regular life.",

    "content": "As I'm sure you already know , there is no such thing as enough. It's like how perfection doesn't exist. \n\nIt may be easier to think of being a writer on a spectrum from hobbyist to full-time artist. The one end is the hobbyist who does it whenever they want and have time (other priorities take precedent). The other end is the artist who is compelled to do it and it has to turn it off in order to live a normal life.\n\nMost people here are somewhere in between. For most of us, the key is to do a combination of two things:\n\n1. Find every way possible at all times to joyfully write. Direct yourself toward it with how live. Write silly things for fun, have a guitar you like to play next to the place you always like to sit, write emotional things for catharsis, write with other people for the collaborative joy, sing in the shower, write on different instruments that feel inspiring, etc etc \n\n2. The harder part is developing habits and practices that keep you consistent. It's easy to write when it's fun. It's harder to write when it's not fun, and that's the time to make sure you're doing it. Daily practices, schedules, deadlines (self imposed or otherwise) are the best way to do this.",

    "content": "I deal with (unintentional) inconsistent tempo and some time even time signature/pulse pretty often when working with songwriters and artists. It seems to solve the problem when you tap your feet to the melody. Then you would realize that the tempo has changed. And count 1-2-3-4 or whatever the meter is. So you don\u2019t end up unintentionally having an extra beat because of words and disrupt everything else. A lot of writers ask people for beats first for this reason, but if the melody doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own- relying on the beats will do more harm than good in my opinion. They often end up being mediocre melodies from my experience because there\u2019s already tons of subdivisions and grooves in the beat and the topliner is relying on that to drive the rhythmic feel. But also beats need to come in with pocket so there are space for the vocal melody to fit in. It would be good for writers to start without a beat or instrumentals and it would be good for beatmakers to practice leaving vocal pockets when starting with a beat first",

I don\u2019t do it anymore, I just master but I am playing with a lot of these ideas applied to my own workflow\u2026i.e. finishing things, focusing on my intuitive flow state\u2026letting things just \u201ccome\u201d to me.\n\nI saw you mentioned you\u2019re applying the practice of scales/learning songs first thing in the morning, etc. I\u2019m assuming that these things just \u201cfind\u201d their way into your workflow when the time is right and you have grasped them.\n\nWhen you\u2019re creating, how often are you actively trying to fit the song into some predetermined mold that you\u2019ve set out? Or are you mostly just accepting what comes?\n\nI saw a great Bill Evans documentary where he said something along the lines of \u201cjust play what you can, and what you are, do not worry about if it\u2019s complicated/advanced/etc\u2026it\u2019s more authentic to play something simple that you feel than something complicated just for the sake of it\u201d\u2026he was talking about jazz improv but I\u2019ve tied it with much success into my work\u2026when it\u2019s time to go I\u2019m only using things I know intuitively and not trying to force myself to be \u201cbetter\u201d than what I really am in that moment. I set aside other time to raise my skill set/potential with specific things (like scales, but for mastering haha)\n\nJust curious if this kind of stuff is on your mind and something you\u2019re actively pursuing. \n\nI think it ties really deeply into the notion of \u201cjust write\u201d\u2026the skills and good music will come. \n\nBut your perspective is so valuable because you\u2019re working on records with deadlines/commercial implications/expectations/etc",

Her choices are informed by a lifetime of experience and point of view. It's almost ineffable at times. It feels like magic. Poetry is elusive. Most humans can barely do it themselves at that level. Asking these programs to perform at that level is... a lot.\n\nThere's a meme that I came across recently. It was the jazz saxophonist Chris Potter describing how in order to do what he does he has to be practicing at a level that is 10x beyond what he might actually play in a session. In a sense he needs creative and technical headroom to arrive at what the result that the rest of us witness.\n\nSome poetry follows this same principle. It's deeply, deeply ingrained and considered. The best poetry resonates and hints at things that aren't even explicitly mentioned. There's an iceberg of practice and experience beneath the surface of what we see. All Chat GPT sees is the surface. The final results that we're feeding it. It has no conception of the experiences that it's trying to replicate so it's approximations of something so complex and nuanced are likely to fall flat.",

Just like the same E major chord could be delivered in different voicings and different style of playing or instruments even. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just about paying attention to it more. I generally pay more attention to music than words by default, so that might be a factor that plays into it. \n\nTechnically- with drums for example, you can use the same tools, try to play it or sequence it with the feel as close to it as possible, and break down what\u2019s on it in terms of processing. If I go further, I can look at how the drums are interacting with the rest of the ensemble. If I just want to rip off the drums from a song, the first three will pretty much get me there. \n\nD\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo is an album I constantly go back to study for the band interaction. Questlove is usually playing straight eighth notes, and very simple pattern. but how open the hihat is, and where he\u2019s hitting, and when he makes the choices to pop the hihat out or kind of let it hide behind the instrumentation is very interesting. Perhaps subtle spontaneous decisions like that isn\u2019t really replicable but I just take it in physically and try to see why he made this by looking at what other instruments are doing. You can just pay attention to how he plays hi hat and go wild playing just the hat along",

And I typically don\u2019t touch lyrics anymore because I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m not that great at lyrics yet and if I don\u2019t have a line (which I usually don\u2019t\u2026.), it\u2019s better to leave it be for the longevity of relationship because lyrics can be one of the most personal things in music making because\u2026 it is literal. If you are more lyrics person, I think you can get a lot of value out of hanging out. \n\nFirst thing is creating safe space- and it really depends on person to person. Some people never open up, some people can open up immediately. In my experience, the more experienced they are - the more they tend to be the latter. I think how much time you spend on it can be dependent on this. You mentioned wanting to be more intentional, one idea that came to my mind is communicating this from the get go. Obviously there are going to be times where bring this up can be weird in the beginning of the session, but it should get them to think about opening up as part of work at the very least. It needs to be done carefully of course\n\nThe other part of it is understanding the person themselves. Their general vibe and energy. It\u2019s easier to tell with some folks, and it\u2019s harder to know what kind of person it is with some other folks. regarding this, I find diving into work right away helps feel it out. my job is often to constantly create ideas and inspirations. I can often gather some information from how they respond to different ideas. \n\nLastly, I used to spend a lot of time hanging up until very recently and I found it\u2019s so much more productive to just work and bond through that experience. Nature of work calls for connecting on a personal level, but it doesn\u2019t require it. I\u2019ve been trying to take it easy on getting closer with people, and focusing on the overall experience of collaboration and it has been making sessions more productive. So I plan on sticking with this way for a bit and see how it goes!",

After he has 24k Goldn there for a few hours and they write another song to gibberish melody.

It\u2019s more geared towards the personal, less towards industry, but I\u2019m so convicted that writing personal songs IS the way to reach others that I would definitely recommend it too.",

Just an option of course - everyone\u2019s got their own way with lyric, it really is so personal. Whatever tools help, use em, whatever tools don\u2019t, chuck em. \n\nI just mention these things bc you talk about making the songs \u2018real\u2019, and I feel that - I love trying to get a song to feel properly grounded, with a sense of place and reality. Best solution I\u2019ve found is to just leave a bit of me in there - somehow it\u2019s like people can feel when songwriting is \u2018real\u2019, so I just try to make sure my heart is in/behind each line, keep them smooth, rinse repeat \n\nWould love to crack open this topic again too, curious on more peoples thoughts on this stuff, thanks for opening this up  @OJ,",
