    "content": "I have a different angle you could try. I would focus almost all your energy on becoming a better, more truthful, richer lyricist. That's the only place you'll be original because there's only one you. Paradoxically, it's also the way you'll write songs that have a universal appeal because the more personal you get, the more the underlying universal emotions will resonate with people.\n\nTrying to be analytical about melodies and structure and style when writing has never yielded good songs for me or literally anyone I know. All the best songwriters I've met write all their best songs lyrics first.\n\nAlso, when you have something to say, it's surprising how little you pay attention to the melody. The melodies and structural components seem to just come when your heart is already in the story.\n\nThe only other thing I'd say is learn A+ songs. Learn the lyrics completely and learn the story behind them as much as possible. Then learn to sing them the way the original version is sung. That will expand your vocabulary as a vocalist and reinforce great lyrics.\n\nLastly, technology is going to continue to increasingly replace stylistic innovation. Yeah AI blah blah blah, but already drum machines and synth presets and splice and DAWs. The last thing to be replaced will be you personally writing things from your experience. Songs about your deepest insecurities and songs about your pet gerbil both fall into this category. Explore all of it.",

(recently it's been Tom Petty Wildflowers at the piano). Then I look at my phone and start my day.\n\nHard to know for sure if it's causal, but my songwriting abilities have sped up. I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks. \n\nI think it's related to several aspects of the morning routine, and they all compound. \n\n*I'm playing music before I'm on my phone, so I'm outputting music before my brain starts reacting.\n\n*doing scales w piano and voice opens up my vocabulary on both instruments and makes me much more comfortable to sing/play ideas when writing\n*doing these to a metronome has improved my timing on all instruments (not just piano and vocal)\n*learning a great song and singing it every morning has massively improved my lyrical writing/ improvisation (probably the hardest part of songwriting) by just reinforcing good *sounding* words.\n*singing and recording the same song every morning for a few days or a week makes me really THINK about vocals and vocal production. How I'm singing the words, how to push certain vowels in a certain part of my voice, etc \n\n@Slow Hand  @Ross Fortune @Will Melones @OJ",

    "content": "Yes exactly! I've found that the best songs are never calculated, they're always just felt as they're being created. They are magical/ incalculable moments. As soon as people start analyzing \u2013 \"is this too generic?\" \"maybe we should have a part like **insert artist**\" \u2013 the songs loses its magic.\n\nBut the paradox is that you can't  just sit around and wait for them to happen. You have to be in motion. So often times building habits and processes (which are calculated) is a great way to keep oneself in the motion of creating things. Piano scales, learning songs, writing a song a day, etc., are just some of the many ways to do this.\n\nAnd the other aspect is also correct. These are skill building exercises that help the quick translation of creative ideas. It's the emotional and psychological side of workflow. Just like technical workflow \u2013 where you want the shortest time between idea an execution \u2013 same goes for writing. If you are constantly writing lyrics and singing melodies and playing instruments, when that emotional magical idea arrives, you can translate it more quickly into lyrics, melody, and music.",

If you\u2019re not familiar with his work, he\u2019s 98 years old and has written lyrics for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Aretha Franklin to Quincey Jones to half of the artists your grandma listened to. \n\nAnyways, some good takeaways from last night\u2019s convo:\n\n\u201cWriters these days are more interested in immediate appeal than they are in a great song. They aren\u2019t the same thing. A great song is only a great song if people will want to cover it in 30 years\u201d \n\nHe cares immensely that whatever is being said in a song is worth saying. Does the message have strong intrinsic value?  \n\nHe\u2019s verrrry quick to say he doesn\u2019t like a song.\n\nHe has a strong preference for melody being written before the lyrics, which is particularly interesting consider his career is as a lyric guy. \n\nHe has a strong dislike for slant rhymes. (I disagreed and it turned into a whole family convo about phonetic tension and release)\n\nHe\u2019s still writing every single day without fail. Today he\u2019s writing on an upcoming Pat Metheny record. \n\nHe\u2019s never heard of Drake or Olivia Rodrigo. Mind you his wife was the president of ASCAP for 15 years so this is particularly mind blowing. It shows me how siloed different worlds can be even when they are so similar and near to one another. What wisdom does one silo have on lock that the other is missing? What rules have been taught to us by people in one silo that don\u2019t apply in the silos we ourselves are working in? A lot to chew on here.",

He\u2019s getting clothes sent out to major label artists right now for free (aside from the cost of shipping and production) because he\u2019s speaking the right language and sending clothes that people actually want. Same thing can be applied to songs.

Almost everyone I know, and seemingly everyone that asks questions here, just needs to write lyrics and melody over and over and over.\n\nIf you want to get reps to become a producer, that's awesome.

So what is meaning for you? \n\nDo you like making things? Do you enjoy the process?

If the emotion is authentic, the song has a MUCH better chance of connecting. Without that emotion, it is almost impossible. \n\nThe more I write songs, the older I get, the more I work with the greatest songwriters, the more I think that writing an authentic emotion is everything. \n\nA favorite example (I have 100 more, just ask): \n\nParty In The USA. Silly pop song? Or deep truth about the power of music being able to transcend loneliness? Go into the lyric and you realize it's Jessie J writing about her first time coming to Los Angeles: \n\nStepped off the plane at LAX with a dream and a cardigan... am I gonna fit in... everybody looks so famous... I'm feeling homesick, too much pressure and I'm nervous... but then my favorite song comes on the radio... I know I'm gonna be ok... it's a party in the USA\"\n\nTbh I tear up every time I think about this song. Yeah people might not analyze the lyric, but the reason this song will play for the next 50 years (and not the 1mil other simple songs about having a party) is the deep, authentic, universal emotion underlying the record.",

We can waste a lot of time in life trying to give people what we think they want from us when it doesn't line up with our own thoughts or desires. Being honest with ourselves and open with others in this way can help to remove a lot of internal struggles that cause us distress. Of course I'm simplifying a nuanced point and everyone's personal context will vary. Nonetheless I do want to give a little positive feedback because while I'm far from a people-pleaser I do, from time to time, have to catch myself shying away from expressing how I really feel on a subject. Again it's nuanced and seems very plain and simple to say so, but being honest in your emotions with yourself and others to the best of your current abilities is going to serve everyone better at the end of the day.

Choose an interval of time that you want to spend practicing a song (10 min, 15 min, 20 min) and practice Song #1 for that amount of time. Then - even if you're not proficient or haven't yet committed the song to memory - move on to practicing Song #2 and let the first song process and consolidate in your memory while you work on Song #2. \n\nWash, rinse, repeat until you go through the entire rotation of songs.  If some songs are significantly more difficult to learn or memorize then come back to them more often.

They don't really get stuck anywhere. If something isn't working (even if they suggested it), they're comfortable moving forward. Just forward momentum, very little negative energy.\n\nAnd so much of that is *simply doing it a lot*. It's great to talk about tips and tricks (and yes, morning routines), but mostly it's just putting in time where you're enjoying doing it. \n\nThat's why I think learning songs is so important. It's actually not really about intellectualizing or analyzing what great songs are doing. It's much more just practicing being in the feeling of singing and playing great music. It's the same feeling you're after when you write. By learning great songs and singing them, you get comfortable in that feeling and you're better able to connect to it when writing.",

The point is to relieve yourself of any editing and force yourself to quickly write lyrics and melodies. \n\nIt's doing two separate and important things: building muscle memory and teaching to work on instinct.\n\nBuilding songwriting muscle memory is just like learning a language. You're practicing over and over until you learn how to express yourself emotionally. This is the basics component. You'll learn what notes you can hit and what words rhyme and how rhythms bounce. You'll build a foundation that will become second nature.\n\nRelated but distinct, you will learn how to move quickly. It turns out most great songs come in an unthinking way. Until you learn how to write without editing and thinking about what you're doing, you are less likely to write those great songs.\n\nI'm speaking from a lot of personal experience, but also whether it's Hemmingway's \"write drunk edit sober,\" or the Rick Rubin, Pharrell, etc. belief that great songs come from some power outside of ourselves (\"Source\" or God or whatever), learning to create without being analytical is super super important.",

Learn their grooves, play along to their songs for a bit.\n\nI think after you take time to play only listening to yourself, and playing along to other songs with a great feel, it\u2019ll be easier to integrate those philosphies into your own productions.\n\nMy drum lessons when I was younger made me stiff and less creative, so finding the right teacher is soooo important.

His instincts for great melody and rhythm, paired with lyrics that sound good, is unmatched. And I say \"sound good,\" because though I think many of the lyrics of his songs are meaningful (especially with the best lyric co-writers), the choice of words and how they are emphasized and enunciated is what separates him from everyone else. It's like Michael Jackson. \n\nDo some YouTube searching on artists talking about working with Max Martin. You can learn a LOT about writing vocal from him.",

But of course, there are always counter-examples to these songwriting principles.",

I think we should recognize that Ralph was doing a statistical analysis. He studied the apex of then-current Billboard charts, set aside everything else, filtered songs by specific characteristics, and drew connections. There's something to learn about the pop music audience. Not sure I choose to look at his \"laws\" as a set of rules.",

But to me, having that manic performance really struck home the idea that you\u2019re experiencing a blur of the night just to lead up to an extremely quiet post chorus to make it feel like you woke up alone.

A lot of this melodic intuition will come with time, familiarity and having a feel for what\u2019s possible.\n\nHow is her ear? I\u2019ve worked with plenty of great singers with little-to-no comprehension for theory. While it can help, I find that for some personality types being too technical and trying to get them to learn theory is a turnoff and is never going to happen. Where does she fit on this spectrum?\n\nDo your best to assure her that she can open up and not be perfect right away. It sounds like she might be clamming up a little bit because she feels uncertain or unconfident. I always try to give my singers a place where they will feel comfortable throwing out any idea. Even horrible ones. It\u2019s okay to fail or fall on your face.  Maybe she needs some reassurance in order to open up. Let her know that she doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Many singers do better when they have a safe space to open up and attempt new things. Even Prince would tell his engineer to leave the room every time when it became time to track his vocals. Hendrix would hide himself behind a wall of gobos where nobody could see him.",

    "content": "Hmm, probably the likes of @BatMeckley and co could speak to this too, but the social skills ain't always the thing.\n\nI've been in rooms with shy/quieter people who are just incredible at what they do. In one case, on a very high profile session, one of the beatmakers literally didn't speak to anyone, ever. He was 19 at the time, literally only opened his mouth to very politely ask me for my email address so he could fly the beat into Pro Tools to cut vocals. But he was making absolute fire, and even though he didn't speak, you could feel a good vibe off him.\n\nI've also been in rooms with *unbelievably* obnoxious characters (the occasional particularly unpleasant example of that LA type we were discussing recently). Utterly repugnant as people, but their work is undeniable.\n\nI know who I prefer to be in a room with (and that really does count for a lot, in my experience), but in the speed dating world of pop music writing that a lot of people go through, you get all sorts. \n\nNot everyone is super charismatic of course, but that's just the world. Either way, 90% of the people I've met at the highest level are really delightful.\n\nAlso, my experience has been that the more accomplished the artist/writer/producer, the more lovely they've been. They've got nothing to prove, and perhaps at a certain level, anyone who's not truly undeniable has already been filtered out of those rooms by being a jerk on the way there.",

I don\u2019t do it anymore, I just master but I am playing with a lot of these ideas applied to my own workflow\u2026i.e. finishing things, focusing on my intuitive flow state\u2026letting things just \u201ccome\u201d to me.\n\nI saw you mentioned you\u2019re applying the practice of scales/learning songs first thing in the morning, etc. I\u2019m assuming that these things just \u201cfind\u201d their way into your workflow when the time is right and you have grasped them.\n\nWhen you\u2019re creating, how often are you actively trying to fit the song into some predetermined mold that you\u2019ve set out? Or are you mostly just accepting what comes?\n\nI saw a great Bill Evans documentary where he said something along the lines of \u201cjust play what you can, and what you are, do not worry about if it\u2019s complicated/advanced/etc\u2026it\u2019s more authentic to play something simple that you feel than something complicated just for the sake of it\u201d\u2026he was talking about jazz improv but I\u2019ve tied it with much success into my work\u2026when it\u2019s time to go I\u2019m only using things I know intuitively and not trying to force myself to be \u201cbetter\u201d than what I really am in that moment. I set aside other time to raise my skill set/potential with specific things (like scales, but for mastering haha)\n\nJust curious if this kind of stuff is on your mind and something you\u2019re actively pursuing. \n\nI think it ties really deeply into the notion of \u201cjust write\u201d\u2026the skills and good music will come. \n\nBut your perspective is so valuable because you\u2019re working on records with deadlines/commercial implications/expectations/etc",

Just like the same E major chord could be delivered in different voicings and different style of playing or instruments even. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just about paying attention to it more. I generally pay more attention to music than words by default, so that might be a factor that plays into it. \n\nTechnically- with drums for example, you can use the same tools, try to play it or sequence it with the feel as close to it as possible, and break down what\u2019s on it in terms of processing. If I go further, I can look at how the drums are interacting with the rest of the ensemble. If I just want to rip off the drums from a song, the first three will pretty much get me there. \n\nD\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo is an album I constantly go back to study for the band interaction. Questlove is usually playing straight eighth notes, and very simple pattern. but how open the hihat is, and where he\u2019s hitting, and when he makes the choices to pop the hihat out or kind of let it hide behind the instrumentation is very interesting. Perhaps subtle spontaneous decisions like that isn\u2019t really replicable but I just take it in physically and try to see why he made this by looking at what other instruments are doing. You can just pay attention to how he plays hi hat and go wild playing just the hat along",

    "content": "I\u2019ve tried different ways with hangs- I\u2019m still figuring out. And I typically don\u2019t touch lyrics anymore because I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m not that great at lyrics yet and if I don\u2019t have a line (which I usually don\u2019t\u2026.), it\u2019s better to leave it be for the longevity of relationship because lyrics can be one of the most personal things in music making because\u2026 it is literal. If you are more lyrics person, I think you can get a lot of value out of hanging out. \n\nFirst thing is creating safe space- and it really depends on person to person. Some people never open up, some people can open up immediately. In my experience, the more experienced they are - the more they tend to be the latter. I think how much time you spend on it can be dependent on this. You mentioned wanting to be more intentional, one idea that came to my mind is communicating this from the get go. Obviously there are going to be times where bring this up can be weird in the beginning of the session, but it should get them to think about opening up as part of work at the very least. It needs to be done carefully of course\n\nThe other part of it is understanding the person themselves. Their general vibe and energy. It\u2019s easier to tell with some folks, and it\u2019s harder to know what kind of person it is with some other folks. regarding this, I find diving into work right away helps feel it out. my job is often to constantly create ideas and inspirations. I can often gather some information from how they respond to different ideas. \n\nLastly, I used to spend a lot of time hanging up until very recently and I found it\u2019s so much more productive to just work and bond through that experience. Nature of work calls for connecting on a personal level, but it doesn\u2019t require it. I\u2019ve been trying to take it easy on getting closer with people, and focusing on the overall experience of collaboration and it has been making sessions more productive. So I plan on sticking with this way for a bit and see how it goes!",

It\u2019s more geared towards the personal, less towards industry, but I\u2019m so convicted that writing personal songs IS the way to reach others that I would definitely recommend it too.",

    "content": "And if you don\u2019t wanna go buying books, I\u2019d recommend possibly trying out the daily practice of object writing; you could even try it for a week or so, and you\u2019ll end up getting interesting imagery, some of which you may be able to use in your songs - but if you stick at it a bit (I find if I do it solidly in the mornings for a week or two it just warms my brain right up for writing throughout the day) it can help get your brain into that mode, so that when you go into your writing sessions later, your brain is already making those connections. Just an option of course - everyone\u2019s got their own way with lyric, it really is so personal. Whatever tools help, use em, whatever tools don\u2019t, chuck em. \n\nI just mention these things bc you talk about making the songs \u2018real\u2019, and I feel that - I love trying to get a song to feel properly grounded, with a sense of place and reality. Best solution I\u2019ve found is to just leave a bit of me in there - somehow it\u2019s like people can feel when songwriting is \u2018real\u2019, so I just try to make sure my heart is in/behind each line, keep them smooth, rinse repeat \n\nWould love to crack open this topic again too, curious on more peoples thoughts on this stuff, thanks for opening this up  @OJ,",

    "content": "Its mostly about personal preference as I like to work with markdown files & have everything local (even though you can connect with third-party apps) and I'm not tied to just apple (even though I'm aware you can export apple notes).\n\nI like that you can link anything with anything, notes to notes, or people to notes, or certain words, to some others and create visual maps, so u can navigate around ideas and everything tied to one person as opposed to hunting stuff down. So I guess its about flexibility + extensiability + md for me",

    "content": "im not a professional, pretty new to music in the sense of trying to create a product/song. Ive been an instrumentalist, engineer, writer, etc etc as a hobby or interest from time to time... and i notice that writing is one of the areas that I have the least doubts about myself. i fully believe i can write interesting bars/emotions/etc from time to time... but it's very much an abstract 'writing' skill that could be applied to poetry or essays or anything... rather than a reflection of my actual song writing ability.\n\ni want to learn how to hone my strengths and bridge the gap between having or putting out decent ideas (wether lyrical or melodic) and actually distilling a song structure and 'product' if you will. A good analogy is the gap between someone with good cinematography instincts/eye vs a director/writer/editor level of structure or authorship",

    "content": "i guess other forms of art like film or books often do require a lot of structure and thought in order to cohesively convey or execute a vision... even if the vision is fundamentally grounded on a seed of feeling or very specific idea. songs and music are so temporal and intuitive that it doesnt really require that necessarily. \n\nfor better and worse, i tend to have this desire to seek out a 'scientific' nature in things. for me as a fan of films, i can often decipher or intuit the internal logic and intentionality that choreographs lights and angles and framing to create a moving feeling/painting. \n\ni do fully agree that fundamentally the only thing that can create this sense of 'spatial awareness' in a medium, or a sense of dialectic/causality between the subtle and intuitive, creative elements is experience and repetition; but i can't help but seek out knowledge or structure/self critique to my approach.\n\ni think to that end, i should collaborate more with people who are experienced so i can accelerate my own learning if that's what i seek. i find myself always searching for this 'internal' awareness of intentionality, searching for the forces and patterns that make a system or experience exist and change how they do.\n\ni am alwasy looking for this feeling of purpose or understanding of which steps are wanted/needed for me to take what ive created closer to its essence or my original vision. i think people understand this at the level of more technical creative aspects... for example mixing. ultimately the art is still to have a creative vision and executing that, but it's the experience and awareness to have intentionality and wisdom in how to execute that separates raw creativity/talent from a professional level of execution no? I think the same can be applied to more abstract skills like writing/songwriting.\n\ni'm going to commit to writing new material everyday for a month and see what happens!",

    "content": "idk what qualifies as a song or not.. but to this end, by chance before i got time to read everyone's response, i happened to turn a small poem and a few lyrics into a valentine voice note for a friend. by nature of simply singing it and imbuing it with melody it sort of became a song. in some sense, its that easy, and i am failing myself by not carving out the time and commitment to that every single day.\n\nperhaps what im asking is really a reflection of a lack of courage and patience/grit. where i'd like technical and direct feedback, i search for 'knowledge' and 'technique' instead of collaborators and mentors. where i am afraid to fail, i avoid the daunting task of putting ink on a blank canvas every day. \n\ni honestly fully agree and expected your answer to be the primary one!",
