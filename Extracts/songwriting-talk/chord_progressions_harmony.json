Even though I theoretically could be writing producing mixing shit for myself, I realize it\u2019s just not that interesting for me, and way more fraught with things that don\u2019t bring me joy. So I make sure that any \u201cartist\u201d type thing I do, any time I\u2019m doing something for myself, I have someone else to work with and for and support. For me, \u201calone\u201d just isn\u2019t that fun. \n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so active on the discord, not cause I like to share as much as I really orient myself in community. I don\u2019t need or even love the sound of my own voice, but it makes more sense to me when I\u2019m the context of others. \n\nI used to think that was a weakness, (thanks Ayn Rand,) but now I employ it thoughtfully and it\u2019s a bit of a superpower. \n\nNot saying you should think of yourself this way, but the artists I know who are successful on a large scale are obsessed with themselves in a way I was never comfortable with. And thank God for artists like that, cause I find my purpose there. It takes all kinds!",

    "content": "I always tailor it to the artist in some way. It's a combination of making fresh ideas specifically for them and taking existing ideas that could work (sometimes reworking existing ideas). I never go into a session like an actual blind date where I don't know anything about them.\n\nThe challenge is always do I make something that sounds like what they've done, or do I make something that sounds like where they're going? That's impossible to answer. I've had success in major label POP artist sessions by having a 100 year old piano and specifically not playing tracks. Meaning, you never know if an artist is tired of doing the same shit. Because I have confidence in my skill as a producer, I'm happy to get an A+ ballad because I know I can turn it into whatever production I want. \"In The Name Of Love\" is my most successful example of this. It's an emotional 3 chord piano ballad that was produced into a festival EDM anthem. \n\nI've had the most success being prepared for all options. Mostly because that makes me flexible for what an artist is feeling that day, but also because the more stuff I make, the more music I'm making. If I prep for a session, I'm not working cold. The prep is also like a psychological and creative warm up for me. Prep makes me a better improviser.",

    "content": "Depending on the kind of wall that you\u2019re hitting with her, there are a few simple approaches that you can suggest that will get her thinking about the different dimensions of melody and how to play with it:\n\nA) Expansion - How long is the melody? It is a small fragment, or a full sentence? Stretch it out over a longer period of time. Sing it half as fast. Hold certain notes for emphasis.\n\nB) Diminution - Compress parts of the melody into faster runs. Make it shorter. Remove notes. Simplify the melody to its melodic essence.\n\nC) Repetition - Take a fragment of the melody and play it again. And again. And again.\n\nD) Modulation - Take a melodic idea and transpose it to different keys. The first movement of Beethoven\u2019s 5th Symphony is built entirely off of a simple four-note motif. He got a lot of mileage from such a small element.\n\nE) Dynamics - Play with volume or intensity. Encourage her to go from soft to loud, or loud to soft. Accent certain notes for emphasis. This one is really powerful. For inspiration suggest that she try voicing her dynamics like a great horn player might. Get her to clip her notes very short or to make them \u201cbloom\u201d or be soft and round. Make them bark or be breathy.\n\nF) Be Another Instrument - Encourage her to try writing as another instrument with her voice. Sing a bass line. Sing a horn part. Sing percussively like Michael Jackson or James Brown would.\n\nG) Role Playing - Give her a character and a persona to inhabit. Make her sing the same thing as different personalities or people. Pick a melody and then make her sing it in the style of three singers that she\u2019d know.",

There\u2019s a really solid formula I\u2019ve learned in marketing to get higher open rates, and my brother who\u2019s launching a clothing brand just found out a really silly formula to get that even better. He\u2019s getting clothes sent out to major label artists right now for free (aside from the cost of shipping and production) because he\u2019s speaking the right language and sending clothes that people actually want. Same thing can be applied to songs. Might make a little outline and post it in here for everyone because it\u2019s not only super important for the entry level grind, but it helps in day to day communication as well!!",

    "content": "I'll give a point by point analysis, cuz why not?\n\nFirst off, I love Irving Berlin. One of the greatest ever. White Christmas, God Bless America, Always, Cheek to Cheek. A master of the craft. \n\nThat being said, adhering to portions of this list could lead a songwriter in 2024 exactly in the wrong direction. Keep in mind two things: one, great artists are rarely great explainers of what makes them great. And two, his career ended in the late 1950s. This means his golden era was pre-Motown, pre-Beates, pre-television, etc.\n\nOk, my thoughts:\n\n1. This doesn't apply any more. He's speaking in relation to a time when music was more complicated. Music is MUCH simpler now. For example, White Christmas has a much larger vocal range than every Selena Gomez song. Also, 99% of songs today are recorded by someone writing it. It's much more important for the singer/songwriter to sing the song in their vocal range than to worry about some future audience. People rarely write songs and then hire a demo singer any more.\n\n2. (and 7 and 8) The best advice on here. Simplify. \"Kill your children.\" Remove things you love in order to make the song more concise.\n\n3. No. The culture changed, there are a million counter examples since Motown/Beatles. Sure, you can write a song without gender (\"you\"), but saying songs SHOULD be genderless is just wrong.\n\n4. Don't write frivolous songs? I'm all about authenticity and connecting emotionally to a song, but this is strangely phrased and doesn't seem very instructive. \n\n5. Every time I've seen people try and follow this, they write bad songs. As the great David Foster said \"There are only 12 notes and 26 letters, and Beethoven and Shakespeare already did it better than you.\" You're unlikely to find original chords, melodies, or words. The only original thing is your own life experience. Don't be \"original,\" be honest.\n\n6. Kinda. I guess I mostly stick to this. But also, there are thousands of great counterexamples after 1960.\n\n7, 8, 9. All great",

I make some time before i have to go anywhere every morning to try and create something. When your brain gets used to the idea that you're going to that place at the same time every day, once you go there then the ideas flow better with time.\n\n3. Understand it's ok to write something bad, with time good ones come. \n\n4. Understand that a song is never actually finished, it can only be abandoned wherever you chose to abandon it.\n\n4.5. Understand that it's ok to figure out what a song means after you write it.\n\n5. Understand that we're trying to make trees, not tables. (As in sometimes it's not healthy to keep refining something till it's too straight edge and the vitality is gone from it)\n\n6. Said it already but saying it again, don't check your phone before you write\n\n7. I don't always write lyrics. Sometimes i write a melody, sometimes a chord progression, sometimes lyrics. Every now and then i do a session of what i call Lego writing, where i try to see what lyrics i wrote before fit with what melody/chord progression etc. \n\n8. Oh and did i mention, it ruins my creativity to check my phone before i make anything? \n\nThis is what works for me, hope it helps you!",

Choose an interval of time that you want to spend practicing a song (10 min, 15 min, 20 min) and practice Song #1 for that amount of time. Then - even if you're not proficient or haven't yet committed the song to memory - move on to practicing Song #2 and let the first song process and consolidate in your memory while you work on Song #2. \n\nWash, rinse, repeat until you go through the entire rotation of songs.  If some songs are significantly more difficult to learn or memorize then come back to them more often. The point is to constantly be checking back in on the songs that you're trying to learn just as you're on the threshold of forgetting them.",

No agonizing over lyrics or Melodies or whatever, if it rhymes and makes some kind of sense, move on with it. \n2) first year: ever song needed a key change or modal shift. Second year: shifting or alt time signatures. Third year: some other esoteric tool I wanted to learn etc\u2026\n3) the moment you\u2019re done, record a voice memo and send it to someone. Mistakes and all. \n\nThe key for these rules was the make the quality of the songs less important than the act of writing. But damn if I didn\u2019t get two or three real winners every year.",

I've been binge-listening to Conversations and in one episode, someone suggested something that might be fun.\n\nIt's a game of telephone/Chinese whispers (is that name for it cancelled?) but with songs - so the first person in the chain writes a song, then the second person listens and rewrites it in their own style, and so on and so on. The key point being that if it's your turn to write, you only get to listen to the song before you ONCE before you write yours.\n\nI really like this idea, I think it'd be cool to see what ideas we get from each other, what stands out the most from each person's interpretation, and so on and so on.\n\nThoughts?",

He's 100% correct on that point.\n\nI'm saying that songwriters often fall into the trap of trying to be \"original.\" They mistakenly think this means they should try to invent new phrases or not use \"generic\" words or try to do something \"interesting\" with the chords. Instead of doing the only original thing that is possible which is tell your story and express your taste. This is actually much more difficult to do because it's incredibly vulnerable.\n\nYou can compose fully original compositions this way. But it's also interesting how much groundbreaking music comes from direct appropriation of existing popular music. \n\nFrom folk music (\"Blowin In The Wind\" is a melody from another song) to hip hop (all of sampling) to producers and DJs making careers from remixes, playing around with current or past hits can also yield incredible new music.",

    "content": "His stance against slant rhymes seems to be more about being in favor of things fitting very tightly together and having intentionality and form and structure. He and another friend of mine viewed slant rhymes as mostly a product of laziness, as if the writer couldn\u2019t be bothered to find something that truly fit.  \n\nI countered referencing the hook to an Olivia Rodrigo song where every single rhyme is a slant rhyme, which IMO adds to the value of it because she\u2019s trying to express how things don\u2019t quite fit and how the thoughts in her mind are unresolved, and the rhyme scheme should reflect that to create a unified feeling. \n\nThe lyrics are:\n\nYou\u2019ve got me thinking\nThat two plus two equals five \nAnd I\u2019m the love of your life \nCause if rain don\u2019t fall and sun don\u2019t shine \nThen changing you is possible \nNo, Love is never logical \n\nHere she\u2019s searching and grasping. She\u2019s unresolved. She literally uses a metaphor of the math not adding up. Why would we then make the math add up phonetically? It would weaken the effect. \n\nAlan was meh on it. \n\nI also argued that hard rhymes can be like the phonetic equivalent of a classical Haydn V-I movement that has very little color or tension, and that slight rhymes can be like jazz chords and that adding a 7 and a sharp 11 on top of the tonic chord doesn\u2019t mean you \u201cfailed to resolve\u201d. Someone else at the table was like \u201cwell show me a truly great song built on slant rhymes and we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m open to it\u201d and in my head I was like \u201cI thought I just did\u201d but they didn\u2019t love it.",

But if they weren\u2019t, how would it change how I identify with them? How would I relate differently to their experiences? What emotions would I feel? How relevant would those chords and that melody be, if the sentiment changed? Would the song have legs at all?\n\nI can be a little more cognisant of how much salt I might add next time, and how much sugar I\u2019ll need to  balance it out.\n\nLike when confronted with Jon\u2019s no compression thing a few years back - a lot of us tried it, discovered it\u2019s not an always/never dichotomy, but in doing so gained a deeper understanding of why and when and how hard we can use that flavour and to what effect.\n\nIt all sharpens the axe.",

It's like how perfection doesn't exist. \n\nIt may be easier to think of being a writer on a spectrum from hobbyist to full-time artist. The one end is the hobbyist who does it whenever they want and have time (other priorities take precedent). The other end is the artist who is compelled to do it and it has to turn it off in order to live a normal life.\n\nMost people here are somewhere in between. For most of us, the key is to do a combination of two things:\n\n1. Find every way possible at all times to joyfully write. Direct yourself toward it with how live. Write silly things for fun, have a guitar you like to play next to the place you always like to sit, write emotional things for catharsis, write with other people for the collaborative joy, sing in the shower, write on different instruments that feel inspiring, etc etc \n\n2. The harder part is developing habits and practices that keep you consistent. It's easy to write when it's fun. It's harder to write when it's not fun, and that's the time to make sure you're doing it. Daily practices, schedules, deadlines (self imposed or otherwise) are the best way to do this.",

As a songwriter I have this toolbox of melodic and harmonic approaches  that I can use to solve any problem when making a song, or to have direction to create another section. But recently I've been noticing that something that makes a huge impact on songs is how the different sections relate to the tempo of the track. I think this might not happen to people who write to a beat, but I think that when you are playing an instrument, tempo is so fluid that some parts of a song might \"feel\" good and others won't (at a same tempo). When all the sections flow well into another in terms of tempo (and probably how that affects to vocal delivery) it sucks you in as a listener and it is way more singable/enjoyable. And now I'm starting to see this as a priority more than which notes of the scale have more weight on the chorus and stuff like that.",

Melodically I tend to be like @Rob Domos and make everything as simple and predictable as possible, but sometimes it feels too easy and there is nothing that stands out. Lately my approach has been to use lyrics and chords to spice things up. For example, If I've got an idea for a lyric that I like, most times the metrics of it won't be incredibly predictable, and when I come up with a melody for it will be a bit more interesting than if I started out with the melody. Maybe then, for another section of the song I'll start with the melody and it'll be simpler. I think contrast is key. It really is an interesting topic!",

    "content": "I think that is what I am after; How do you say the same idea or concept/story but deliver it tastefully. Just like the same E major chord could be delivered in different voicings and different style of playing or instruments even. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just about paying attention to it more. I generally pay more attention to music than words by default, so that might be a factor that plays into it. \n\nTechnically- with drums for example, you can use the same tools, try to play it or sequence it with the feel as close to it as possible, and break down what\u2019s on it in terms of processing. If I go further, I can look at how the drums are interacting with the rest of the ensemble. If I just want to rip off the drums from a song, the first three will pretty much get me there. \n\nD\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo is an album I constantly go back to study for the band interaction. Questlove is usually playing straight eighth notes, and very simple pattern. but how open the hihat is, and where he\u2019s hitting, and when he makes the choices to pop the hihat out or kind of let it hide behind the instrumentation is very interesting. Perhaps subtle spontaneous decisions like that isn\u2019t really replicable but I just take it in physically and try to see why he made this by looking at what other instruments are doing. You can just pay attention to how he plays hi hat and go wild playing just the hat along",

    "content": "A couple of things I always do before and during sessions\n\nHave some things ready to play so collaborators can understand my background, and same with collaborators. I would ask them to play some things they did and grew up listening to so I can understand where they are coming from with decisions or comments they make. \n\nAlways set up so it\u2019s ready to record. have a phone running on record whenever music is played and the computer isn\u2019t recording\n\nHave a few small incomplete ideas at disposal before walking into the sessions. Could be a simple guitar chord progression with a little something on top, could be riff or banging drum patterns. Important thing here for me is to continue moving on to next ideas if I don\u2019t get an immediate response (which is usually singing on top) and continue to work my way into it. \n\nI like to have full drums ready to go somewhere on my computer. So I can just import it in, and it will get people moving. Splice drum loops are fine too. Some sort of instant vibe is needed in my experience. Splice really helps with that, because then you don\u2019t have people looking at the back of your head trying to dial in drums or synth patch for more than 5 minutes.",

I feel like when I\u2019m improvising over a beat or something I tend to make similar subconscious choices in the melodic structure/melodic rhythms/etc. the only way I can get out of it is by setting parameters before hand (ex: don\u2019t start the melody on the 1\u2026..use an AAAB structure\u2026\u2026..make the A sections complex and have their own micro-structures/use many types of rhythms,  use like 3-4 notes in the scale maximum and mostly dwell on a single pitch/don\u2019t hit the \u201cmoney notes\u201d lol\u2026..Make the B section almost completely one  consistent rhythm, use way more notes in the scale than the \u201cA\u201d and hit all the notes you didn\u2019t hit in the \u201cA\u201d to resolve the melody)",

Some bands only used one chord progression and would occasionally change the words or melody and they would consistently get #1\u2019s off the same formula. Many bands would also cover other people\u2019s songs and they would be hits as well.",
