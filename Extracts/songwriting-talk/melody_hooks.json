    "content": "If you're trying to be a highly successful professional, you should do all of these things and be prepared to adjust on the fly.\n\nI pretty much always have full songs, tracks, hooks, and concepts prepared. Much of the time, you won't use any of them on any given day. But good news: they're useful for future days.\n\nI've had all of that prepared and then the artist and I just chat for five hours, then write a song on a piano.\n\nI've had all that prepared and then cut song after song because the artist goes \"what else do you have???\"\n\nAnecdote that might be helpful: I've been in with an artist all week. Me, another producer/writer, and her. The other producer/writer has his rig set up and he also writes topline. We usually bounce back and forth depending on what the song requires. We've all worked together before and we had the whole week blocked out so there's no pressure to perform on day one. But we did three songs on the first day because she just came in firing. The first song she came in with a title and we worked from scratch and knocked it out in an hour. The other producer made the track quick with some existing drum loops he had prepped for her, adding keys and horns as we wrote. Then she asked \"do you have anything to play?\" I played her a track hook I had prepared. She liked it and we powered through that one in another hour. Then we broke for lunch. We caught up. As we were finishing she mentioned this one kinda stupid and sassy idea she tried to bring into another session but the producers didn't like it. So we wrote that one and it was fire. I tapped out a tempo as she rapped the hook idea and just make a skeleton beat on the fly.\n\nBeing way over prepared is rarely going to hurt you.",

    "content": "I have a different angle you could try. I would focus almost all your energy on becoming a better, more truthful, richer lyricist. That's the only place you'll be original because there's only one you. Paradoxically, it's also the way you'll write songs that have a universal appeal because the more personal you get, the more the underlying universal emotions will resonate with people.\n\nTrying to be analytical about melodies and structure and style when writing has never yielded good songs for me or literally anyone I know. All the best songwriters I've met write all their best songs lyrics first.\n\nAlso, when you have something to say, it's surprising how little you pay attention to the melody. The melodies and structural components seem to just come when your heart is already in the story.\n\nThe only other thing I'd say is learn A+ songs. Learn the lyrics completely and learn the story behind them as much as possible. Then learn to sing them the way the original version is sung. That will expand your vocabulary as a vocalist and reinforce great lyrics.\n\nLastly, technology is going to continue to increasingly replace stylistic innovation. Yeah AI blah blah blah, but already drum machines and synth presets and splice and DAWs. The last thing to be replaced will be you personally writing things from your experience. Songs about your deepest insecurities and songs about your pet gerbil both fall into this category. Explore all of it.",

    "content": "Some songwriting-related morning routine thoughts:\n\nI've been starting my day with doing piano scales and vocal warm ups to a metronome and then singing/ learning a song and recording a voice note of it. (recently it's been Tom Petty Wildflowers at the piano). Then I look at my phone and start my day.\n\nHard to know for sure if it's causal, but my songwriting abilities have sped up. I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks. \n\nI think it's related to several aspects of the morning routine, and they all compound. \n\n*I'm playing music before I'm on my phone, so I'm outputting music before my brain starts reacting.\n\n*doing scales w piano and voice opens up my vocabulary on both instruments and makes me much more comfortable to sing/play ideas when writing\n*doing these to a metronome has improved my timing on all instruments (not just piano and vocal)\n*learning a great song and singing it every morning has massively improved my lyrical writing/ improvisation (probably the hardest part of songwriting) by just reinforcing good *sounding* words.\n*singing and recording the same song every morning for a few days or a week makes me really THINK about vocals and vocal production. How I'm singing the words, how to push certain vowels in a certain part of my voice, etc \n\n@Slow Hand  @Ross Fortune @Will Melones @OJ",

    "content": "Yes exactly! I've found that the best songs are never calculated, they're always just felt as they're being created. They are magical/ incalculable moments. As soon as people start analyzing \u2013 \"is this too generic?\" \"maybe we should have a part like **insert artist**\" \u2013 the songs loses its magic.\n\nBut the paradox is that you can't  just sit around and wait for them to happen. You have to be in motion. So often times building habits and processes (which are calculated) is a great way to keep oneself in the motion of creating things. Piano scales, learning songs, writing a song a day, etc., are just some of the many ways to do this.\n\nAnd the other aspect is also correct. These are skill building exercises that help the quick translation of creative ideas. It's the emotional and psychological side of workflow. Just like technical workflow \u2013 where you want the shortest time between idea an execution \u2013 same goes for writing. If you are constantly writing lyrics and singing melodies and playing instruments, when that emotional magical idea arrives, you can translate it more quickly into lyrics, melody, and music.",

    "content": "Depending on the kind of wall that you\u2019re hitting with her, there are a few simple approaches that you can suggest that will get her thinking about the different dimensions of melody and how to play with it:\n\nA) Expansion - How long is the melody? It is a small fragment, or a full sentence? Stretch it out over a longer period of time. Sing it half as fast. Hold certain notes for emphasis.\n\nB) Diminution - Compress parts of the melody into faster runs. Make it shorter. Remove notes. Simplify the melody to its melodic essence.\n\nC) Repetition - Take a fragment of the melody and play it again. And again. And again.\n\nD) Modulation - Take a melodic idea and transpose it to different keys. The first movement of Beethoven\u2019s 5th Symphony is built entirely off of a simple four-note motif. He got a lot of mileage from such a small element.\n\nE) Dynamics - Play with volume or intensity. Encourage her to go from soft to loud, or loud to soft. Accent certain notes for emphasis. This one is really powerful. For inspiration suggest that she try voicing her dynamics like a great horn player might. Get her to clip her notes very short or to make them \u201cbloom\u201d or be soft and round. Make them bark or be breathy.\n\nF) Be Another Instrument - Encourage her to try writing as another instrument with her voice. Sing a bass line. Sing a horn part. Sing percussively like Michael Jackson or James Brown would.\n\nG) Role Playing - Give her a character and a persona to inhabit. Make her sing the same thing as different personalities or people. Pick a melody and then make her sing it in the style of three singers that she\u2019d know.",

If you\u2019re not familiar with his work, he\u2019s 98 years old and has written lyrics for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Aretha Franklin to Quincey Jones to half of the artists your grandma listened to. \n\nAnyways, some good takeaways from last night\u2019s convo:\n\n\u201cWriters these days are more interested in immediate appeal than they are in a great song. They aren\u2019t the same thing. A great song is only a great song if people will want to cover it in 30 years\u201d \n\nHe cares immensely that whatever is being said in a song is worth saying. Does the message have strong intrinsic value?  \n\nHe\u2019s verrrry quick to say he doesn\u2019t like a song.\n\nHe has a strong preference for melody being written before the lyrics, which is particularly interesting consider his career is as a lyric guy. \n\nHe has a strong dislike for slant rhymes. (I disagreed and it turned into a whole family convo about phonetic tension and release)\n\nHe\u2019s still writing every single day without fail. Today he\u2019s writing on an upcoming Pat Metheny record. \n\nHe\u2019s never heard of Drake or Olivia Rodrigo. Mind you his wife was the president of ASCAP for 15 years so this is particularly mind blowing. It shows me how siloed different worlds can be even when they are so similar and near to one another. What wisdom does one silo have on lock that the other is missing? What rules have been taught to us by people in one silo that don\u2019t apply in the silos we ourselves are working in? A lot to chew on here.",

Almost everyone I know, and seemingly everyone that asks questions here, just needs to write lyrics and melody over and over and over.\n\nIf you want to get reps to become a producer, that's awesome. Go to #\ud83c\udfb9production-talk and talk about those reps.\n\nTrying to also do production while doing the exercises that we're talking about will only slow you down.",

    "content": "I'll give a point by point analysis, cuz why not?\n\nFirst off, I love Irving Berlin. One of the greatest ever. White Christmas, God Bless America, Always, Cheek to Cheek. A master of the craft. \n\nThat being said, adhering to portions of this list could lead a songwriter in 2024 exactly in the wrong direction. Keep in mind two things: one, great artists are rarely great explainers of what makes them great. And two, his career ended in the late 1950s. This means his golden era was pre-Motown, pre-Beates, pre-television, etc.\n\nOk, my thoughts:\n\n1. This doesn't apply any more. He's speaking in relation to a time when music was more complicated. Music is MUCH simpler now. For example, White Christmas has a much larger vocal range than every Selena Gomez song. Also, 99% of songs today are recorded by someone writing it. It's much more important for the singer/songwriter to sing the song in their vocal range than to worry about some future audience. People rarely write songs and then hire a demo singer any more.\n\n2. (and 7 and 8) The best advice on here. Simplify. \"Kill your children.\" Remove things you love in order to make the song more concise.\n\n3. No. The culture changed, there are a million counter examples since Motown/Beatles. Sure, you can write a song without gender (\"you\"), but saying songs SHOULD be genderless is just wrong.\n\n4. Don't write frivolous songs? I'm all about authenticity and connecting emotionally to a song, but this is strangely phrased and doesn't seem very instructive. \n\n5. Every time I've seen people try and follow this, they write bad songs. As the great David Foster said \"There are only 12 notes and 26 letters, and Beethoven and Shakespeare already did it better than you.\" You're unlikely to find original chords, melodies, or words. The only original thing is your own life experience. Don't be \"original,\" be honest.\n\n6. Kinda. I guess I mostly stick to this. But also, there are thousands of great counterexamples after 1960.\n\n7, 8, 9. All great",

I make some time before i have to go anywhere every morning to try and create something. When your brain gets used to the idea that you're going to that place at the same time every day, once you go there then the ideas flow better with time.\n\n3. Understand it's ok to write something bad, with time good ones come. \n\n4. Understand that a song is never actually finished, it can only be abandoned wherever you chose to abandon it.\n\n4.5. Understand that it's ok to figure out what a song means after you write it.\n\n5. Understand that we're trying to make trees, not tables. (As in sometimes it's not healthy to keep refining something till it's too straight edge and the vitality is gone from it)\n\n6. Said it already but saying it again, don't check your phone before you write\n\n7. I don't always write lyrics. Sometimes i write a melody, sometimes a chord progression, sometimes lyrics. Every now and then i do a session of what i call Lego writing, where i try to see what lyrics i wrote before fit with what melody/chord progression etc. \n\n8. Oh and did i mention, it ruins my creativity to check my phone before i make anything? \n\nThis is what works for me, hope it helps you!",

The point is to relieve yourself of any editing and force yourself to quickly write lyrics and melodies. \n\nIt's doing two separate and important things: building muscle memory and teaching to work on instinct.\n\nBuilding songwriting muscle memory is just like learning a language. You're practicing over and over until you learn how to express yourself emotionally. This is the basics component. You'll learn what notes you can hit and what words rhyme and how rhythms bounce. You'll build a foundation that will become second nature.\n\nRelated but distinct, you will learn how to move quickly. It turns out most great songs come in an unthinking way. Until you learn how to write without editing and thinking about what you're doing, you are less likely to write those great songs.\n\nI'm speaking from a lot of personal experience, but also whether it's Hemmingway's \"write drunk edit sober,\" or the Rick Rubin, Pharrell, etc. belief that great songs come from some power outside of ourselves (\"Source\" or God or whatever), learning to create without being analytical is super super important.",

Instead of doing the only original thing that is possible which is tell your story and express your taste.

It would weaken the effect. \n\nAlan was meh on it. \n\nI also argued that hard rhymes can be like the phonetic equivalent of a classical Haydn V-I movement that has very little color or tension, and that slight rhymes can be like jazz chords and that adding a 7 and a sharp 11 on top of the tonic chord doesn\u2019t mean you \u201cfailed to resolve\u201d. Someone else at the table was like \u201cwell show me a truly great song built on slant rhymes and we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m open to it\u201d and in my head I was like \u201cI thought I just did\u201d but they didn\u2019t love it.",

Or at least an electric with no pedal board. Leave that at home. Something that will force you both to focus on the core song and not be diverted by sonic considerations. Those can all come later.\n\nThink of it like writing a lead sheet: Chords, melody, and lyrics. This is the heart of the song. Focus on getting that right and you'll unlock so much potential.",

He is well known as a detail oriented, vocal-focused pop savant. He is often a part of every choice from writing lyrics and melody all the way to adjusting sibilance in the mix. His instincts for great melody and rhythm, paired with lyrics that sound good, is unmatched. And I say \"sound good,\" because though I think many of the lyrics of his songs are meaningful (especially with the best lyric co-writers), the choice of words and how they are emphasized and enunciated is what separates him from everyone else. It's like Michael Jackson. \n\nDo some YouTube searching on artists talking about working with Max Martin. You can learn a LOT about writing vocal from him.",

Turns out playing more makes me find cool tones which gives me cool ideas that I end up finding melodies to while I\u2019m practicing whatever it is that sounds fun that day. Then to double down on the practice I come up with lead lines over the track until my fingies get tired and then lay down the vocal.",

But if they weren\u2019t, how would it change how I identify with them? How would I relate differently to their experiences? What emotions would I feel? How relevant would those chords and that melody be, if the sentiment changed? Would the song have legs at all?\n\nI can be a little more cognisant of how much salt I might add next time, and how much sugar I\u2019ll need to  balance it out.\n\nLike when confronted with Jon\u2019s no compression thing a few years back - a lot of us tried it, discovered it\u2019s not an always/never dichotomy, but in doing so gained a deeper understanding of why and when and how hard we can use that flavour and to what effect.\n\nIt all sharpens the axe.",

As a songwriter I have this toolbox of melodic and harmonic approaches  that I can use to solve any problem when making a song, or to have direction to create another section. But recently I've been noticing that something that makes a huge impact on songs is how the different sections relate to the tempo of the track. I think this might not happen to people who write to a beat, but I think that when you are playing an instrument, tempo is so fluid that some parts of a song might \"feel\" good and others won't (at a same tempo). When all the sections flow well into another in terms of tempo (and probably how that affects to vocal delivery) it sucks you in as a listener and it is way more singable/enjoyable. And now I'm starting to see this as a priority more than which notes of the scale have more weight on the chorus and stuff like that.",

And as you mentioned, high notes can move the energy and accent the rhythm. Lyrical stress patterns could contribute to the accenting and note selections. Weight sometimes means notes that are held longer than the other sometimes the opposite. Contrasts can do a lot though. Range of movement or the range of the pitches themselves, pacing of the rhythm and rests, breaking the patterns/repetition can help with contrast",

And when tempo changes, even if the ratio remains the same, it has a different impact on how it feels. And, sometimes, because you might not be writing to a click, different sections of a song might \"feel\" cohesive at different tempos. And when you sum everything up it just doesn't translate well. And I've had the experience of trying to work around it but ended up noticing that it didn't have to do with the melodic rhythm in each section, but how it relates to the whole song. And now I try to be more aware of it because I think it might be something that is not easily noticeable when you are writing. I don't know if that makes sense (I'm not a native english speaker and therefore I struggle a bit sometimes \ud83d\ude06 ).",

    "content": "I deal with (unintentional) inconsistent tempo and some time even time signature/pulse pretty often when working with songwriters and artists. It seems to solve the problem when you tap your feet to the melody. Then you would realize that the tempo has changed. And count 1-2-3-4 or whatever the meter is. So you don\u2019t end up unintentionally having an extra beat because of words and disrupt everything else. A lot of writers ask people for beats first for this reason, but if the melody doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own- relying on the beats will do more harm than good in my opinion. They often end up being mediocre melodies from my experience because there\u2019s already tons of subdivisions and grooves in the beat and the topliner is relying on that to drive the rhythmic feel. But also beats need to come in with pocket so there are space for the vocal melody to fit in. It would be good for writers to start without a beat or instrumentals and it would be good for beatmakers to practice leaving vocal pockets when starting with a beat first",

Melodically I tend to be like @Rob Domos and make everything as simple and predictable as possible, but sometimes it feels too easy and there is nothing that stands out. Lately my approach has been to use lyrics and chords to spice things up. For example, If I've got an idea for a lyric that I like, most times the metrics of it won't be incredibly predictable, and when I come up with a melody for it will be a bit more interesting than if I started out with the melody. Maybe then, for another section of the song I'll start with the melody and it'll be simpler. I think contrast is key. It really is an interesting topic!",

I\u2019ve worked with plenty of great singers with little-to-no comprehension for theory. While it can help, I find that for some personality types being too technical and trying to get them to learn theory is a turnoff and is never going to happen. Where does she fit on this spectrum?\n\nDo your best to assure her that she can open up and not be perfect right away. It sounds like she might be clamming up a little bit because she feels uncertain or unconfident. I always try to give my singers a place where they will feel comfortable throwing out any idea. Even horrible ones. It\u2019s okay to fail or fall on your face.  Maybe she needs some reassurance in order to open up. Let her know that she doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Many singers do better when they have a safe space to open up and attempt new things. Even Prince would tell his engineer to leave the room every time when it became time to track his vocals. Hendrix would hide himself behind a wall of gobos where nobody could see him.",

Often you have to sacrifice one virtue to gain another, but there are certainly valuable aspects of music that have been lost over time with popular music. Our melodies and harmonies no longer have long arcs where different points in the journey express different points on an emotional rollercoaster, which was a staple aspect of most classics from 80 years ago. Hell even 30 years ago Disney songs had beautiful arcs. Sing \u201cpart of your world\u201d from the little mermaid to yourself and feel the rollercoaster of the arc in that hook. It\u2019s magical.

If you\u2018ve ever been in a club with hundreds of people singing along to Hangover on the top of their lungs you know what I mean. Raw power.

The biggest unlock for me was to write an entire song\u2019s lyrics first, sometimes preceded with some journaling and/or research on the topic so I have real, meaningful things to draw from. I keep track of syllables etc so it lines up.\n\nOnce the lyrics are done and I\u2019m working on the song, I always end up having to change a lot, usually simplify and take out, but it\u2019s an easy problem when you have excess good lyrical content. As opposed to trying to summon something meaningful to fit a certain melody.\n\nSimple stuff like starting with getting the chorus right has also been super helpful, and keeping production to a minimum before the topline is finished.\n\nExcited to read more people\u2019s hacks here",

And he\u2019s down!\n\nHere are my questions (and this is a *total* explain it to me like I\u2019m five situation\u2014I\u2019ve really struggled to make sense of things business/session flow-wise outside of getting paid for a discrete deliverable or a day rate):\n\nI don\u2019t feel a need to be too formal about things right now, but is this sort of partnership where we could pursue a joint publishing deal?\n\nMy main motivation is two-fold: keep a foot in production/engineering while I\u2019ve leaned more and more into mixing recently, and use our credits to get in a room with bigger artists. Am I way off here?\n\nAnything I\u2019m missing/obviously oblivious to?",

    "content": "@peterlabberton  I've not seen a joint publishing deal as you describe it, though I suppose it's possible. Generally it makes sense for everyone to have separate publishing deals as many songs get written with different people and different splits. You could certainly sign to the same publisher at the same time, just with separate deals. Or this person could sign you to their publisher with some finders fee type thing.\n\nWhat it sounds like you're doing is providing a great sounding board and musicianship for someone who is more primarily a songwriter? If so, you would just participate in any songs that are written in the room. If it's the sort of thing where he is really doing the bulk of the songwriting (like all the lyrics and melody, and you're helping with some of the music) you could certainly work out a deal where you get a smaller piece.",

In this course he spends hours going over exactly how he writes lyrics to his gibberish melodies. Then how he goes about pitching these ideas to artists. After he has 24k Goldn there for a few hours and they write another song to gibberish melody.

I focus on the soundscape of the chords and melody, add a drum skeleton for lyric writing, write lyrics with song sections and overall composition in mind, then go back and change the production and drums to interact with the combination of the composition I envisioned and the cadence of the lyrics and how the drums interact with both at the same time.\n\nHuh - I\u2019d like to be a fly on the wall for the drum first sessions to see how it all unfolds.",
