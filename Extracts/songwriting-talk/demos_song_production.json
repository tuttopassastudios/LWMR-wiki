    "content": "If you're trying to be a highly successful professional, you should do all of these things and be prepared to adjust on the fly.\n\nI pretty much always have full songs, tracks, hooks, and concepts prepared. Much of the time, you won't use any of them on any given day. But good news: they're useful for future days.\n\nI've had all of that prepared and then the artist and I just chat for five hours, then write a song on a piano.\n\nI've had all that prepared and then cut song after song because the artist goes \"what else do you have???\"\n\nAnecdote that might be helpful: I've been in with an artist all week. Me, another producer/writer, and her. The other producer/writer has his rig set up and he also writes topline. We usually bounce back and forth depending on what the song requires. We've all worked together before and we had the whole week blocked out so there's no pressure to perform on day one. But we did three songs on the first day because she just came in firing. The first song she came in with a title and we worked from scratch and knocked it out in an hour. The other producer made the track quick with some existing drum loops he had prepped for her, adding keys and horns as we wrote. Then she asked \"do you have anything to play?\" I played her a track hook I had prepared. She liked it and we powered through that one in another hour. Then we broke for lunch. We caught up. As we were finishing she mentioned this one kinda stupid and sassy idea she tried to bring into another session but the producers didn't like it. So we wrote that one and it was fire. I tapped out a tempo as she rapped the hook idea and just make a skeleton beat on the fly.\n\nBeing way over prepared is rarely going to hurt you.",

(recently it's been Tom Petty Wildflowers at the piano). Then I look at my phone and start my day.\n\nHard to know for sure if it's causal, but my songwriting abilities have sped up. I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks. \n\nI think it's related to several aspects of the morning routine, and they all compound. \n\n*I'm playing music before I'm on my phone, so I'm outputting music before my brain starts reacting.\n\n*doing scales w piano and voice opens up my vocabulary on both instruments and makes me much more comfortable to sing/play ideas when writing\n*doing these to a metronome has improved my timing on all instruments (not just piano and vocal)\n*learning a great song and singing it every morning has massively improved my lyrical writing/ improvisation (probably the hardest part of songwriting) by just reinforcing good *sounding* words.\n*singing and recording the same song every morning for a few days or a week makes me really THINK about vocals and vocal production. How I'm singing the words, how to push certain vowels in a certain part of my voice, etc \n\n@Slow Hand  @Ross Fortune @Will Melones @OJ",

    "content": "I always tailor it to the artist in some way. It's a combination of making fresh ideas specifically for them and taking existing ideas that could work (sometimes reworking existing ideas). I never go into a session like an actual blind date where I don't know anything about them.\n\nThe challenge is always do I make something that sounds like what they've done, or do I make something that sounds like where they're going? That's impossible to answer. I've had success in major label POP artist sessions by having a 100 year old piano and specifically not playing tracks. Meaning, you never know if an artist is tired of doing the same shit. Because I have confidence in my skill as a producer, I'm happy to get an A+ ballad because I know I can turn it into whatever production I want. \"In The Name Of Love\" is my most successful example of this. It's an emotional 3 chord piano ballad that was produced into a festival EDM anthem. \n\nI've had the most success being prepared for all options. Mostly because that makes me flexible for what an artist is feeling that day, but also because the more stuff I make, the more music I'm making. If I prep for a session, I'm not working cold. The prep is also like a psychological and creative warm up for me. Prep makes me a better improviser.",

    "content": "Watched this video last night of Billie and Finneas talking about writing \"Birds of a Feather.\" The main thing that stood out to me was hearing them discuss how long it took and how much they disliked the song at first. It sounds like they were writing and rewriting it for almost a year and it almost didn't make the album. They also emphasized the amount of time it took to record; Billie mentioned that it took a bunch of days just to figure out the delivery of the first line and at one point Finneas was like \"oh yeah, that 10 second vocal stack tucked way in the background took us 7 hours.\" I feel like we all hear stories of great songs being written and recorded really quickly and at least for myself I sometimes find it frustrating and discouraging when things aren't coming together like that. I think this is partly because I'm comparing myself to a made up notion that all of the best artists/writers/producers are able to consistently finish a great song in a single session. But I guess this video is reminding me that sometimes the quality that makes these people great is their perseverance and willingness to face discomfort and frustration and keep going long enough to finish an idea.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bkjEO_Zj2g&ab_channel=BillieEilish",

Same thing can be applied to songs.

Almost everyone I know, and seemingly everyone that asks questions here, just needs to write lyrics and melody over and over and over.\n\nIf you want to get reps to become a producer, that's awesome.

    "content": "I'll give a point by point analysis, cuz why not?\n\nFirst off, I love Irving Berlin. One of the greatest ever. White Christmas, God Bless America, Always, Cheek to Cheek. A master of the craft. \n\nThat being said, adhering to portions of this list could lead a songwriter in 2024 exactly in the wrong direction. Keep in mind two things: one, great artists are rarely great explainers of what makes them great. And two, his career ended in the late 1950s. This means his golden era was pre-Motown, pre-Beates, pre-television, etc.\n\nOk, my thoughts:\n\n1. This doesn't apply any more. He's speaking in relation to a time when music was more complicated. Music is MUCH simpler now. For example, White Christmas has a much larger vocal range than every Selena Gomez song. Also, 99% of songs today are recorded by someone writing it. It's much more important for the singer/songwriter to sing the song in their vocal range than to worry about some future audience. People rarely write songs and then hire a demo singer any more.\n\n2. (and 7 and 8) The best advice on here. Simplify. \"Kill your children.\" Remove things you love in order to make the song more concise.\n\n3. No. The culture changed, there are a million counter examples since Motown/Beatles. Sure, you can write a song without gender (\"you\"), but saying songs SHOULD be genderless is just wrong.\n\n4. Don't write frivolous songs? I'm all about authenticity and connecting emotionally to a song, but this is strangely phrased and doesn't seem very instructive. \n\n5. Every time I've seen people try and follow this, they write bad songs. As the great David Foster said \"There are only 12 notes and 26 letters, and Beethoven and Shakespeare already did it better than you.\" You're unlikely to find original chords, melodies, or words. The only original thing is your own life experience. Don't be \"original,\" be honest.\n\n6. Kinda. I guess I mostly stick to this. But also, there are thousands of great counterexamples after 1960.\n\n7, 8, 9. All great",

I\u2019ve got some projects that I\u2019ve put many hours into, just to let them sit on a hard drive for years.\n\nCo-writing has helped a lot, and has taken some ideas to places I never would have thought to go. The feeling that you have some moral obligation to your collaborators to finish is motivating. When you\u2019re making art for yourself, it doesn\u2019t benefit from those positive forces of peer pressure, and there\u2019s a lack of constraints and no sense of urgency. \n\nI think making creative decisions is metabolically expensive. It\u2019s easier to defer all decisions, which is why you see DAW-age producers committing to so little until the mix. In the same way you can defer the entire songwriting process, especially if you have someone else\u2019s project or deadline to prioritize over your own.\n\nTo be both the creative mind and the executive finisher is a lot of exhausting context switching. Some options might be to split these responsibilities with someone else, or to dedicate separate time to each task. If someone hires me to print stems or solder a patchbay, the last thing I want to do is engage in creativity. But when I get inspired to write, I don\u2019t want to stop and troubleshoot the plug-in that\u2019s crashing the session.\n\nMaybe like the divergence/convergence approach would be to set aside an hour or three at the end of your day to finish ideas you\u2019ve already got brewing\u2014set a timer and finish a song, or a verse. Or, even better yet, dedicate the *end* of your day to play and experimentation. Then the next morning, hopefully with fresh perspective, get in the mood to tie up loose ends and prepare your next steps. You\u2019ve demonstrated that you\u2019re good at wearing that hat for other artists, so you can do it for your songs, too. Just maybe not while you\u2019re in the creative flow.\n\nI\u2019m not practicing what I preach, just brain-dumping. I definitely don\u2019t have this figured out.",

Instead of doing the only original thing that is possible which is tell your story and express your taste.

    "content": "This is a little of the top of my head, but I'll try and break it down like this. You're mostly going to get work/ collaborators for three reasons. \n\nThe #1 is your work (great songs, in this case). If you make great shit, people will either hear it and reach out, or when you meet someone, you'll send each other things and they'll love your work and want to be a part of what you can do. no matter where you are in your career, this is #1 always always always. When I was starting out, I produced some of the best sounding records for local bands, so other local bands wanted to work with me. Now, I (or my manager, or my publisher) can send a spotify playlist with songs people know, and that helps get me gigs.\n\n#2 is making shit with people you know personally. This is the best way to do it starting out since you don't have lots of great work out in the world. You need a little community of friends that you make shit with. I guess a lot of that will start moving online, but still the vast majority of great work gets done in person. Even during the pandemic, despite all the zoom writing session and remote work, most great stuff was still getting done in person. You gotta find your people and make things. Then you have the advantage of multiple people promoting your work.\n\n#3 is the pure cold call hustle. It's TOUGH. It's a low percentage game no matter what you're trying to do (be it mixing or writing or producing or being an artist). You have to understand that you may get 1% response rate from people. It's not to say it doesn't have value, but if you want responses, you have to have a good pitch and sending out thousands of messages. But the other thing about this is that writing songs remotely frankly fucking sucks compared to doing it in person. Songwriting is such an in the moment emotional thing. Producing and mixing remotely is very very different that doing real time creative vulnerability. This #3 applies more to non-songwriting collaborations than anything else.",

    "content": "I also think most of my worst writing sessions happen when we don\u2019t clear the air about what someone is looking for. If I\u2019m writing with someone who doesn\u2019t trust themselves as much or doesn\u2019t feel comfortable leading a session because they\u2019re pretty new to writing, I\u2019ll try to be more of an active guide rather than a sounding board. I\u2019ve also had people who get embarassed to write in front of others so I\u2019ll just chill on my phone on the porch for them lmao. \n\nI think people who are writers and producers struggle to collaborator with that middle ground between seasoned pro/artist with very clear vision, and very \u201cgreen\u201d artist. They won\u2019t feel comfortable having someone write a whole song for them but they don\u2019t quite trust their own judgement yet either. I think the solution is to practice the idea of commitment.  Sometimes the best writing contribution is letting them do a lot of the lifting, and if the artist gets insecure or flustered, just ask them \u201cwell, how do you feel about the idea/line?\u201d or \u201cwhat about the line feels awkward?\u201d That way you\u2019re helping them to actually make decisions\u2014now they\u2019ll be able to write with you or anyone else, or completely solo.",

Then having an exploratory meeting to discuss what\u2019s in the playlist. Point to things and find common ground for where they are as a performer / songwriter comparative to the songs they chose. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to express to a producer what you want. This a great way to start. Then, keep shaving off songs on that playlist until you guys have 5 - 10 songs that you both believe sounds like what you\u2019re both going for.  \n\nI\u2019ve found this to be a Huge help when in the exploratory stages with a new artist.",

That shit is sick. The beauty in art isn\u2019t about who consumes it in my opinion. Or how many people. It\u2019s about the process of creating it.

So I\u2019d start practicing some grooves solo, no click for now, no music. Listen closely to drummers that you love that have that feel throughout songs. Learn their grooves, play along to their songs for a bit.\n\nI think after you take time to play only listening to yourself, and playing along to other songs with a great feel, it\u2019ll be easier to integrate those philosphies into your own productions.\n\nMy drum lessons when I was younger made me stiff and less creative, so finding the right teacher is soooo important. It wasn\u2019t until I played solo to make the drums impactful by themselves, and played along to a ton of hiatus kaiyote and esperanza spalding that i was able to have a musical feel",

I use a lot of guitar pedals & programmed drum loops to create a vibe & then I\u2019ll write a song to that. \n\nI use Notes to organize things. The parent folder in the screenshot is also kind of an inbox & contains in-progress songs that don\u2019t yet have a folder home. \n\nI use Voice Memos often & have a little naming convention system: \n\n\u201cWorking Title proto\u201d for first recording of an idea\n\u201cWorking Title YYYYMMDD\u201d for each iteration after\n\u201cSFX title description\u201d for field recordings\n\nI use voice memos as long as I\u2019m developing an idea outside of a DAW. Sometimes I have to let songs brew for a long time, play them out loud a lot, and listen back as an editor with fresh ears before they feel like themselves. Love using these tools to fit that work in while I\u2019m at the grocery store or in the car.",

But mostly drums first.\n\nBuild an instrumental just chasing intuition, quickly. 2-3 melody parts and a bass line on top of drums. And youve got a chorus loop. \n\nThen take that improvisational melody muscle and apply it to the vocal melody. \n\nIm not a big humming guy, I get to words pretty quickly. But will start with common phrases to me like,  \"runnin runnin runnin round runnin runnin runnin down\" I have a few others.\n\nI start to land on a melody, with a feeling and story. That I haven't told. Sometimes it takes 90 seconds, sometimes 5-10 mins. \n\nRecord and comp till I have what I like. Than do all the background vocals. \n\nThen start muting a couple of the melody parts. Find my verses.\n\nRinse repeat the process above. But now I know the story and I just have to find the melody and the thru line narrative.\n\nDepending on how the verses feel running into the chorus. Or short length of track. I'll write a bridge \n\nMelodyne the vocals.\n\nStructure the song.\n\nMix the song.\n\nUpload the song.\n\nMake another.\n\nThis usually takes 2-4 days, intermittent with regular life.",

And as you mentioned, high notes can move the energy and accent the rhythm. Lyrical stress patterns could contribute to the accenting and note selections. Weight sometimes means notes that are held longer than the other sometimes the opposite. Contrasts can do a lot though. Range of movement or the range of the pitches themselves, pacing of the rhythm and rests, breaking the patterns/repetition can help with contrast",

    "content": "I deal with (unintentional) inconsistent tempo and some time even time signature/pulse pretty often when working with songwriters and artists. It seems to solve the problem when you tap your feet to the melody. Then you would realize that the tempo has changed. And count 1-2-3-4 or whatever the meter is. So you don\u2019t end up unintentionally having an extra beat because of words and disrupt everything else. A lot of writers ask people for beats first for this reason, but if the melody doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own- relying on the beats will do more harm than good in my opinion. They often end up being mediocre melodies from my experience because there\u2019s already tons of subdivisions and grooves in the beat and the topliner is relying on that to drive the rhythmic feel. But also beats need to come in with pocket so there are space for the vocal melody to fit in. It would be good for writers to start without a beat or instrumentals and it would be good for beatmakers to practice leaving vocal pockets when starting with a beat first",

I\u2019ve worked with plenty of great singers with little-to-no comprehension for theory. While it can help, I find that for some personality types being too technical and trying to get them to learn theory is a turnoff and is never going to happen. Where does she fit on this spectrum?\n\nDo your best to assure her that she can open up and not be perfect right away. It sounds like she might be clamming up a little bit because she feels uncertain or unconfident. I always try to give my singers a place where they will feel comfortable throwing out any idea. Even horrible ones. It\u2019s okay to fail or fall on your face.  Maybe she needs some reassurance in order to open up. Let her know that she doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Many singers do better when they have a safe space to open up and attempt new things. Even Prince would tell his engineer to leave the room every time when it became time to track his vocals. Hendrix would hide himself behind a wall of gobos where nobody could see him.",

As co-writer and producer I feel that this is a great jumping off point but it's not 100% of the way there and it will take some refinement. They're very excited about it. And they should be, because it's elegant and it's exciting.\n\nMy concern is that they may rest on their feelings of accomplishment and not give it that extra push and exploration that I believe it needs to truly shine.\n\nWhat do you find is a good way to guide collaborators towards exploring an idea further and pushing themselves harder to really make something exceptional? I feel there are only so many ways that I can say \"I really like what you've done, but let's explore some more stuff\" without exhausting them or undermining the praise that I am giving them. How do I show them what's possible without micromanaging and writing it myself? It should come from within them and feel like it's theirs.",

In one case, on a very high profile session, one of the beatmakers literally didn't speak to anyone, ever. He was 19 at the time, literally only opened his mouth to very politely ask me for my email address so he could fly the beat into Pro Tools to cut vocals. But he was making absolute fire, and even though he didn't speak, you could feel a good vibe off him.\n\nI've also been in rooms with *unbelievably* obnoxious characters (the occasional particularly unpleasant example of that LA type we were discussing recently). Utterly repugnant as people, but their work is undeniable.\n\nI know who I prefer to be in a room with (and that really does count for a lot, in my experience), but in the speed dating world of pop music writing that a lot of people go through, you get all sorts. \n\nNot everyone is super charismatic of course, but that's just the world. Either way, 90% of the people I've met at the highest level are really delightful.\n\nAlso, my experience has been that the more accomplished the artist/writer/producer, the more lovely they've been. They've got nothing to prove, and perhaps at a certain level, anyone who's not truly undeniable has already been filtered out of those rooms by being a jerk on the way there.",

I find that nearly all of the best songs I've written happen in about an hour long window of excitement. Sometimes you can stretch and get harmonies or punch in some vocals beyond that hour, but the excitement of a great idea is exhausting and it's hard to keep everyone 100% engaged for a long period of time. If I'm on hour 2 of a song and we're still trying to decide if we like a chorus, 100% of the time it's not a good song (in my experience).\n\nA BIG mistake I make (still) is \"oh we have tomorrow we can take a break and come back.\" It's not about being able to get the artist physically back, but getting everyone back into the emotional space. So much of what I need from an artist is the emotional focused to commit 100% to a vocal.",

There seemed to have been something magical about those lyrics and that particular kind of songwriting that really resonated with people and created an unbeblievable sense of unity. If you\u2018ve ever been in a club with hundreds of people singing along to Hangover on the top of their lungs you know what I mean. Raw power.

    "content": "Do the songwriters get paid to create those demos?  No...  but they often PAY OTHERS to help them make the demo possible.  Nashville folk will often have \"Demo Days\" where a group of Ace players charge a flat fee to perform and record the rhythm section (for instance, could be anything the song needs). They might record 5-10 tracks in a day. I'm sure some have done more. These \"demo day tracks\" are used by songwriters to then pitch their track to recording artists, labels, anyone.  There's also a whole army of producers ready to help songwriters demo-up...  where the songwriter pays a producer to turnkey the track.  Sometimes it's one guy playing everything or a few remote players all chipping in under the producers direction.  \n\nAnd...  these are viewed as a \"very basic demo\" in the eyes of industry vets. A really good \"one take\" by great players with high quality equipment recording the basic tracks is a strong demo but not fully produced. Happens all the time, but the producer (and their team) gets paid by the songwriter (or their team) to produce the track.",

The biggest unlock for me was to write an entire song\u2019s lyrics first, sometimes preceded with some journaling and/or research on the topic so I have real, meaningful things to draw from. I keep track of syllables etc so it lines up.\n\nOnce the lyrics are done and I\u2019m working on the song, I always end up having to change a lot, usually simplify and take out, but it\u2019s an easy problem when you have excess good lyrical content. As opposed to trying to summon something meaningful to fit a certain melody.\n\nSimple stuff like starting with getting the chorus right has also been super helpful, and keeping production to a minimum before the topline is finished.\n\nExcited to read more people\u2019s hacks here",

This is great.\n\nI made a similar transition from producing bands to doing co-writing sessions as a producer. You can still get hired as a producer or engineer (as I still do), but writing sessions are structured with different expectations and potential outcomes. \n\nWhen you participate in songwriting sessions, you are almost never getting paid up front as an engineer or producer. There are some cases where super rich people will pay for songwriting sessions, or artist with bigger budgets might get their label to pay a studio fee, but this will be a tiny minority of your writing sessions. \n\nPhilosophically, the idea is that you're all creating something together that, if it's good enough, it will be released into the world in someway. But your experimenting and will make many ideas that don't cross that threshold. However, if any of the recordings of these song come out you will still get paid as a producer (/ engineer / mixer / whatever else you do on the final version). If no peace of the recording that you made when the song was written gets used, you will still participate as a songwriter on the copyright.",

The short answer is, it will most certainly give you a leg up at some point, and almost every successful producer/songwriter who doesn't otherwise have a huge artist in their hometown that they exclusively work with moves to one of the big cities at some point.

Ive been an instrumentalist, engineer, writer, etc etc as a hobby or interest from time to time... and i notice that writing is one of the areas that I have the least doubts about myself. i fully believe i can write interesting bars/emotions/etc from time to time... but it's very much an abstract 'writing' skill that could be applied to poetry or essays or anything... rather than a reflection of my actual song writing ability.\n\ni want to learn how to hone my strengths and bridge the gap between having or putting out decent ideas (wether lyrical or melodic) and actually distilling a song structure and 'product' if you will. A good analogy is the gap between someone with good cinematography instincts/eye vs a director/writer/editor level of structure or authorship",
