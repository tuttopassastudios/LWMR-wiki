    "content": "If you're trying to be a highly successful professional, you should do all of these things and be prepared to adjust on the fly.\n\nI pretty much always have full songs, tracks, hooks, and concepts prepared. Much of the time, you won't use any of them on any given day. But good news: they're useful for future days.\n\nI've had all of that prepared and then the artist and I just chat for five hours, then write a song on a piano.\n\nI've had all that prepared and then cut song after song because the artist goes \"what else do you have???\"\n\nAnecdote that might be helpful: I've been in with an artist all week. Me, another producer/writer, and her. The other producer/writer has his rig set up and he also writes topline. We usually bounce back and forth depending on what the song requires. We've all worked together before and we had the whole week blocked out so there's no pressure to perform on day one. But we did three songs on the first day because she just came in firing. The first song she came in with a title and we worked from scratch and knocked it out in an hour. The other producer made the track quick with some existing drum loops he had prepped for her, adding keys and horns as we wrote. Then she asked \"do you have anything to play?\" I played her a track hook I had prepared. She liked it and we powered through that one in another hour. Then we broke for lunch. We caught up. As we were finishing she mentioned this one kinda stupid and sassy idea she tried to bring into another session but the producers didn't like it. So we wrote that one and it was fire. I tapped out a tempo as she rapped the hook idea and just make a skeleton beat on the fly.\n\nBeing way over prepared is rarely going to hurt you.",

That's the only place you'll be original because there's only one you. Paradoxically, it's also the way you'll write songs that have a universal appeal because the more personal you get, the more the underlying universal emotions will resonate with people.\n\nTrying to be analytical about melodies and structure and style when writing has never yielded good songs for me or literally anyone I know. All the best songwriters I've met write all their best songs lyrics first.\n\nAlso, when you have something to say, it's surprising how little you pay attention to the melody. The melodies and structural components seem to just come when your heart is already in the story.\n\nThe only other thing I'd say is learn A+ songs. Learn the lyrics completely and learn the story behind them as much as possible. Then learn to sing them the way the original version is sung. That will expand your vocabulary as a vocalist and reinforce great lyrics.\n\nLastly, technology is going to continue to increasingly replace stylistic innovation. Yeah AI blah blah blah, but already drum machines and synth presets and splice and DAWs. The last thing to be replaced will be you personally writing things from your experience. Songs about your deepest insecurities and songs about your pet gerbil both fall into this category. Explore all of it.",

(recently it's been Tom Petty Wildflowers at the piano). Then I look at my phone and start my day.\n\nHard to know for sure if it's causal, but my songwriting abilities have sped up. I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks. \n\nI think it's related to several aspects of the morning routine, and they all compound. \n\n*I'm playing music before I'm on my phone, so I'm outputting music before my brain starts reacting.\n\n*doing scales w piano and voice opens up my vocabulary on both instruments and makes me much more comfortable to sing/play ideas when writing\n*doing these to a metronome has improved my timing on all instruments (not just piano and vocal)\n*learning a great song and singing it every morning has massively improved my lyrical writing/ improvisation (probably the hardest part of songwriting) by just reinforcing good *sounding* words.\n*singing and recording the same song every morning for a few days or a week makes me really THINK about vocals and vocal production. How I'm singing the words, how to push certain vowels in a certain part of my voice, etc \n\n@Slow Hand  @Ross Fortune @Will Melones @OJ",

    "content": "Yes exactly! I've found that the best songs are never calculated, they're always just felt as they're being created. They are magical/ incalculable moments. As soon as people start analyzing \u2013 \"is this too generic?\" \"maybe we should have a part like **insert artist**\" \u2013 the songs loses its magic.\n\nBut the paradox is that you can't  just sit around and wait for them to happen. You have to be in motion. So often times building habits and processes (which are calculated) is a great way to keep oneself in the motion of creating things. Piano scales, learning songs, writing a song a day, etc., are just some of the many ways to do this.\n\nAnd the other aspect is also correct. These are skill building exercises that help the quick translation of creative ideas. It's the emotional and psychological side of workflow. Just like technical workflow \u2013 where you want the shortest time between idea an execution \u2013 same goes for writing. If you are constantly writing lyrics and singing melodies and playing instruments, when that emotional magical idea arrives, you can translate it more quickly into lyrics, melody, and music.",

It's a combination of making fresh ideas specifically for them and taking existing ideas that could work (sometimes reworking existing ideas). I never go into a session like an actual blind date where I don't know anything about them.\n\nThe challenge is always do I make something that sounds like what they've done, or do I make something that sounds like where they're going? That's impossible to answer. I've had success in major label POP artist sessions by having a 100 year old piano and specifically not playing tracks. Meaning, you never know if an artist is tired of doing the same shit. Because I have confidence in my skill as a producer, I'm happy to get an A+ ballad because I know I can turn it into whatever production I want. \"In The Name Of Love\" is my most successful example of this. It's an emotional 3 chord piano ballad that was produced into a festival EDM anthem. \n\nI've had the most success being prepared for all options. Mostly because that makes me flexible for what an artist is feeling that day, but also because the more stuff I make, the more music I'm making. If I prep for a session, I'm not working cold. The prep is also like a psychological and creative warm up for me. Prep makes me a better improviser.",

If you\u2019re not familiar with his work, he\u2019s 98 years old and has written lyrics for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Aretha Franklin to Quincey Jones to half of the artists your grandma listened to. \n\nAnyways, some good takeaways from last night\u2019s convo:\n\n\u201cWriters these days are more interested in immediate appeal than they are in a great song. They aren\u2019t the same thing. A great song is only a great song if people will want to cover it in 30 years\u201d \n\nHe cares immensely that whatever is being said in a song is worth saying. Does the message have strong intrinsic value?  \n\nHe\u2019s verrrry quick to say he doesn\u2019t like a song.\n\nHe has a strong preference for melody being written before the lyrics, which is particularly interesting consider his career is as a lyric guy. \n\nHe has a strong dislike for slant rhymes. (I disagreed and it turned into a whole family convo about phonetic tension and release)\n\nHe\u2019s still writing every single day without fail. Today he\u2019s writing on an upcoming Pat Metheny record. \n\nHe\u2019s never heard of Drake or Olivia Rodrigo. Mind you his wife was the president of ASCAP for 15 years so this is particularly mind blowing. It shows me how siloed different worlds can be even when they are so similar and near to one another. What wisdom does one silo have on lock that the other is missing? What rules have been taught to us by people in one silo that don\u2019t apply in the silos we ourselves are working in?

I\u2019m in mastering now, so while I do a lot of collaboration it\u2019s not quite what you\u2019re getting at here but I\u2019ve got a decent amount of experience in the room/tracking/producing. \n\nTo me it is a matter of developing trust and belief with another person. My approach is to be brutally honest with people and let the chips fall where they may. When things are amazing, meh, or bad. As @BatMeckley said\u2026you want the $10k mic. Don\u2019t waste the time with anything in the middle.\n\nSo in short \u2014 I\u2019d just tell them exactly what you wrote above. But I tend to be more on the extremes \u2014 I\u2019d like to think that people come away from working with me with a deep-seated belief in themselves and their potential but also honest feedback about very specific things we can do better. I actively seek to challenge my collaborators (which I\u2019m sure you do as well). I\u2019ve found people really respond to this if it\u2019s done with the clear intention to help both of us improve and with the curiosity of the potential in the art!\n\nIn short, I\u2019m an extreme encourager but also a harsh critic (in a kind way). I never let someone give up on themselves if I can help it and show love for them by very specifically calling out how I recognize their potential but see areas for improvement!\n\nI feel that I\u2019ve always been able to tell when people do things like \u201clead with a compliment\u201d or whatever. So that\u2019s my POV on this whole topic\u2026I just like people to be straight with me. When I have dealt with artists who clearly need the validation you\u2019re speaking about\u2026.I\u2019ll specifically call it out with something like \u201cstop looking for validation you have the talent to do this now start believing in yourself\u201d\u2026etc. Seems sort of harsh but it really can cut to the chase and open up a deeper level of trust and communication.\n\nSometimes people don\u2019t like this\u2026and that\u2019s all good too.

If the emotion is authentic, the song has a MUCH better chance of connecting. Without that emotion, it is almost impossible. \n\nThe more I write songs, the older I get, the more I work with the greatest songwriters, the more I think that writing an authentic emotion is everything. \n\nA favorite example (I have 100 more, just ask): \n\nParty In The USA. Silly pop song? Or deep truth about the power of music being able to transcend loneliness? Go into the lyric and you realize it's Jessie J writing about her first time coming to Los Angeles: \n\nStepped off the plane at LAX with a dream and a cardigan... am I gonna fit in... everybody looks so famous... I'm feeling homesick, too much pressure and I'm nervous... but then my favorite song comes on the radio... I know I'm gonna be ok... it's a party in the USA\"\n\nTbh I tear up every time I think about this song. Yeah people might not analyze the lyric, but the reason this song will play for the next 50 years (and not the 1mil other simple songs about having a party) is the deep, authentic, universal emotion underlying the record.",

    "content": "I'll give a point by point analysis, cuz why not?\n\nFirst off, I love Irving Berlin. One of the greatest ever. White Christmas, God Bless America, Always, Cheek to Cheek. A master of the craft. \n\nThat being said, adhering to portions of this list could lead a songwriter in 2024 exactly in the wrong direction. Keep in mind two things: one, great artists are rarely great explainers of what makes them great. And two, his career ended in the late 1950s. This means his golden era was pre-Motown, pre-Beates, pre-television, etc.\n\nOk, my thoughts:\n\n1. This doesn't apply any more. He's speaking in relation to a time when music was more complicated. Music is MUCH simpler now. For example, White Christmas has a much larger vocal range than every Selena Gomez song. Also, 99% of songs today are recorded by someone writing it. It's much more important for the singer/songwriter to sing the song in their vocal range than to worry about some future audience. People rarely write songs and then hire a demo singer any more.\n\n2. (and 7 and 8) The best advice on here. Simplify. \"Kill your children.\" Remove things you love in order to make the song more concise.\n\n3. No. The culture changed, there are a million counter examples since Motown/Beatles. Sure, you can write a song without gender (\"you\"), but saying songs SHOULD be genderless is just wrong.\n\n4. Don't write frivolous songs? I'm all about authenticity and connecting emotionally to a song, but this is strangely phrased and doesn't seem very instructive. \n\n5. Every time I've seen people try and follow this, they write bad songs. As the great David Foster said \"There are only 12 notes and 26 letters, and Beethoven and Shakespeare already did it better than you.\" You're unlikely to find original chords, melodies, or words. The only original thing is your own life experience. Don't be \"original,\" be honest.\n\n6. Kinda. I guess I mostly stick to this. But also, there are thousands of great counterexamples after 1960.\n\n7, 8, 9. All great",

We can waste a lot of time in life trying to give people what we think they want from us when it doesn't line up with our own thoughts or desires. Being honest with ourselves and open with others in this way can help to remove a lot of internal struggles that cause us distress. Of course I'm simplifying a nuanced point and everyone's personal context will vary. Nonetheless I do want to give a little positive feedback because while I'm far from a people-pleaser I do, from time to time, have to catch myself shying away from expressing how I really feel on a subject. Again it's nuanced and seems very plain and simple to say so, but being honest in your emotions with yourself and others to the best of your current abilities is going to serve everyone better at the end of the day.

Oh and did i mention, it ruins my creativity to check my phone before i make anything? \n\nThis is what works for me, hope it helps you!",

No agonizing over lyrics or Melodies or whatever, if it rhymes and makes some kind of sense, move on with it. \n2) first year: ever song needed a key change or modal shift. Second year: shifting or alt time signatures. Third year: some other esoteric tool I wanted to learn etc\u2026\n3) the moment you\u2019re done, record a voice memo and send it to someone.

The point is to relieve yourself of any editing and force yourself to quickly write lyrics and melodies. \n\nIt's doing two separate and important things: building muscle memory and teaching to work on instinct.\n\nBuilding songwriting muscle memory is just like learning a language. You're practicing over and over until you learn how to express yourself emotionally. This is the basics component. You'll learn what notes you can hit and what words rhyme and how rhythms bounce. You'll build a foundation that will become second nature.\n\nRelated but distinct, you will learn how to move quickly. It turns out most great songs come in an unthinking way. Until you learn how to write without editing and thinking about what you're doing, you are less likely to write those great songs.\n\nI'm speaking from a lot of personal experience, but also whether it's Hemmingway's \"write drunk edit sober,\" or the Rick Rubin, Pharrell, etc. belief that great songs come from some power outside of ourselves (\"Source\" or God or whatever), learning to create without being analytical is super super important.",

Instead of doing the only original thing that is possible which is tell your story and express your taste. This is actually much more difficult to do because it's incredibly vulnerable.\n\nYou can compose fully original compositions this way. But it's also interesting how much groundbreaking music comes from direct appropriation of existing popular music. \n\nFrom folk music (\"Blowin In The Wind\" is a melody from another song) to hip hop (all of sampling) to producers and DJs making careers from remixes, playing around with current or past hits can also yield incredible new music.",

Because forced reps is the only way to learn the language of songwriting. You need to practice over and over to get the muscle memory of writing. It's like the language of an instrument or a literal spoken language.\n\nAny books, tips, videos, classes, spiritual paths, etc etc are only useful right now if they get you to write MORE. But really, you do not need them. I strongly disagree with anyone who says otherwise.\n\nFWIW, my 25 years, billions of streams, platinum hit songs, blah blah has taught me that reps are the ONLY foundation. The best songwriters write all the time and didn't really get good until they'd written hundreds to thousands of songs.\n\n@Zack Hames is on the right track. But don't \"attempt\" to write a song a day. Force yourself to do it. Immerse like you would learning a language. Don't wait to express yourself perfectly, start writing songs like a five-year-old and work your way up. \n\nUnlike mixing where you need to learn how things like compression work, or like playing guitar where it's important to have someone show you proper technique, you cannot learn how to be a great songwriter by anything other than doing it over and over*.",

    "content": "This is a little of the top of my head, but I'll try and break it down like this. You're mostly going to get work/ collaborators for three reasons. \n\nThe #1 is your work (great songs, in this case). If you make great shit, people will either hear it and reach out, or when you meet someone, you'll send each other things and they'll love your work and want to be a part of what you can do. no matter where you are in your career, this is #1 always always always. When I was starting out, I produced some of the best sounding records for local bands, so other local bands wanted to work with me. Now, I (or my manager, or my publisher) can send a spotify playlist with songs people know, and that helps get me gigs.\n\n#2 is making shit with people you know personally. This is the best way to do it starting out since you don't have lots of great work out in the world. You need a little community of friends that you make shit with. I guess a lot of that will start moving online, but still the vast majority of great work gets done in person. Even during the pandemic, despite all the zoom writing session and remote work, most great stuff was still getting done in person. You gotta find your people and make things. Then you have the advantage of multiple people promoting your work.\n\n#3 is the pure cold call hustle. It's TOUGH. It's a low percentage game no matter what you're trying to do (be it mixing or writing or producing or being an artist). You have to understand that you may get 1% response rate from people. It's not to say it doesn't have value, but if you want responses, you have to have a good pitch and sending out thousands of messages. But the other thing about this is that writing songs remotely frankly fucking sucks compared to doing it in person. Songwriting is such an in the moment emotional thing. Producing and mixing remotely is very very different that doing real time creative vulnerability. This #3 applies more to non-songwriting collaborations than anything else.",

He and another friend of mine viewed slant rhymes as mostly a product of laziness, as if the writer couldn\u2019t be bothered to find something that truly fit.  \n\nI countered referencing the hook to an Olivia Rodrigo song where every single rhyme is a slant rhyme, which IMO adds to the value of it because she\u2019s trying to express how things don\u2019t quite fit and how the thoughts in her mind are unresolved, and the rhyme scheme should reflect that to create a unified feeling. \n\nThe lyrics are:\n\nYou\u2019ve got me thinking\nThat two plus two equals five \nAnd I\u2019m the love of your life \nCause if rain don\u2019t fall and sun don\u2019t shine \nThen changing you is possible \nNo, Love is never logical \n\nHere she\u2019s searching and grasping. She\u2019s unresolved. She literally uses a metaphor of the math not adding up. Why would we then make the math add up phonetically? It would weaken the effect. \n\nAlan was meh on it. \n\nI also argued that hard rhymes can be like the phonetic equivalent of a classical Haydn V-I movement that has very little color or tension, and that slight rhymes can be like jazz chords and that adding a 7 and a sharp 11 on top of the tonic chord doesn\u2019t mean you \u201cfailed to resolve\u201d.

If I\u2019m writing with someone who doesn\u2019t trust themselves as much or doesn\u2019t feel comfortable leading a session because they\u2019re pretty new to writing, I\u2019ll try to be more of an active guide rather than a sounding board. I\u2019ve also had people who get embarassed to write in front of others so I\u2019ll just chill on my phone on the porch for them lmao. \n\nI think people who are writers and producers struggle to collaborator with that middle ground between seasoned pro/artist with very clear vision, and very \u201cgreen\u201d artist. They won\u2019t feel comfortable having someone write a whole song for them but they don\u2019t quite trust their own judgement yet either. I think the solution is to practice the idea of commitment.  Sometimes the best writing contribution is letting them do a lot of the lifting, and if the artist gets insecure or flustered, just ask them \u201cwell, how do you feel about the idea/line?\u201d or \u201cwhat about the line feels awkward?\u201d That way you\u2019re helping them to actually make decisions\u2014now they\u2019ll be able to write with you or anyone else, or completely solo.",

    "content": "Hmmm. Fun challenge. So both of these songs seem to be pretty heavy on evocative or surrealistic imagery without an obvious central subject (if there is one at all).\n\nHow about this idea: For each section of your song pull up a movie scene that you know or enjoy. Then write down everything you see without explicitly giving away what movie scene it is. Describe everything. Pick out details. Whether their actually represented in the scene or you're just speculating on something that *could* be. Or make up descriptions of the scenario beyond what's actually spelled out:\n\n*Two people casting glances across the room. One doesn't notice*\n*Hard shadows stretched across the floor*\n*Does he have enough cash in his wallet?*\n*Somebody's running late*\n*The room is thick with tension*\n*Someone did the crime*\n\nI dunno. I'm just spitballing, here.\n\nOR start mashing concepts together. Things that don't normally co-exist. You're bound to get some evocative results. Cedric from *The Mars Volta* fits into this mode pretty well. His lyrics are extremely evocative but after all these years I still can't say for sure what they're actually saying. If there's a coherent thought in his songs it's so far obfuscated that you'd never know anyways.",

Just fake it if you need to, ~especially~ in the early writing stages. You can always go back and revisit ideas, but once someone feels like their enthusiasm and creativity and taste is being questioned, it takes forever to rebuild that trust. Mirror their emotions, get excited, be specific. THEN, once you have established the kinship and spent your own time living with the idea and better understanding what would improve it, you can bring up \u201chey I was thinking and I have some ideas that might be able to make what you created hit even more!\u201d",

Theresa few exercises we used to get m, some for eveyone and another was based on each person's writing styles. \nfora general excercise teach would have us write down a phrase or two we overheard during the week ina public setting (train. bus, in class etc) and create a short story that Stems from it.  this is good for being able to create things out if nothing - world creation using a set core, \n\nmy natural writing style is v descriptive so one of my peesonal excercises was to write explicit sex scenes every week. it's extremely hard to find the correct balance between keeping it enticing and going over the top and losing either making the readers cringe  or unintentionally laugh. (and we laughed so often \ud83d\ude02)\nall these would be read and workshopped in the class itself. \n\nI think one of my main skillsets now is based in those skills. I'm very good at re-writing / editing and most of all reframing sentences. when other ppl give mea direction to follow, whether  it's just the idea or maybe they already have words and need to readjust to whatever music we now have on hand. \n\njust recently wrote a whole song I thought was too generic and open ended but loved the ideas. pitched to an artist and they loved it. we're working on editing the lyrics to insert a ciuole personal scenarios of hers but most of the vocal melodies and words are actually the same as what I had.",

He is well known as a detail oriented, vocal-focused pop savant. He is often a part of every choice from writing lyrics and melody all the way to adjusting sibilance in the mix. His instincts for great melody and rhythm, paired with lyrics that sound good, is unmatched. And I say \"sound good,\" because though I think many of the lyrics of his songs are meaningful (especially with the best lyric co-writers), the choice of words and how they are emphasized and enunciated is what separates him from everyone else. It's like Michael Jackson. \n\nDo some YouTube searching on artists talking about working with Max Martin. You can learn a LOT about writing vocal from him.",

How relevant would those chords and that melody be, if the sentiment changed? Would the song have legs at all?\n\nI can be a little more cognisant of how much salt I might add next time, and how much sugar I\u2019ll need to  balance it out.\n\nLike when confronted with Jon\u2019s no compression thing a few years back - a lot of us tried it, discovered it\u2019s not an always/never dichotomy, but in doing so gained a deeper understanding of why and when and how hard we can use that flavour and to what effect.\n\nIt all sharpens the axe.",

    "content": "As I'm sure you already know , there is no such thing as enough. It's like how perfection doesn't exist. \n\nIt may be easier to think of being a writer on a spectrum from hobbyist to full-time artist. The one end is the hobbyist who does it whenever they want and have time (other priorities take precedent). The other end is the artist who is compelled to do it and it has to turn it off in order to live a normal life.\n\nMost people here are somewhere in between. For most of us, the key is to do a combination of two things:\n\n1. Find every way possible at all times to joyfully write. Direct yourself toward it with how live. Write silly things for fun, have a guitar you like to play next to the place you always like to sit, write emotional things for catharsis, write with other people for the collaborative joy, sing in the shower, write on different instruments that feel inspiring, etc etc \n\n2. The harder part is developing habits and practices that keep you consistent. It's easy to write when it's fun. It's harder to write when it's not fun, and that's the time to make sure you're doing it. Daily practices, schedules, deadlines (self imposed or otherwise) are the best way to do this.",

As a songwriter I have this toolbox of melodic and harmonic approaches  that I can use to solve any problem when making a song, or to have direction to create another section. But recently I've been noticing that something that makes a huge impact on songs is how the different sections relate to the tempo of the track. I think this might not happen to people who write to a beat, but I think that when you are playing an instrument, tempo is so fluid that some parts of a song might \"feel\" good and others won't (at a same tempo). When all the sections flow well into another in terms of tempo (and probably how that affects to vocal delivery) it sucks you in as a listener and it is way more singable/enjoyable. And now I'm starting to see this as a priority more than which notes of the scale have more weight on the chorus and stuff like that.",

    "content": "I think a lot of it has to do with the melodic rhythm. In terms of how the sections flow, if the melody can drive it on its own- the accompaniment or production will follow. And as you mentioned, high notes can move the energy and accent the rhythm. Lyrical stress patterns could contribute to the accenting and note selections. Weight sometimes means notes that are held longer than the other sometimes the opposite. Contrasts can do a lot though. Range of movement or the range of the pitches themselves, pacing of the rhythm and rests, breaking the patterns/repetition can help with contrast",

    "content": "I deal with (unintentional) inconsistent tempo and some time even time signature/pulse pretty often when working with songwriters and artists. It seems to solve the problem when you tap your feet to the melody. Then you would realize that the tempo has changed. And count 1-2-3-4 or whatever the meter is. So you don\u2019t end up unintentionally having an extra beat because of words and disrupt everything else. A lot of writers ask people for beats first for this reason, but if the melody doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own- relying on the beats will do more harm than good in my opinion. They often end up being mediocre melodies from my experience because there\u2019s already tons of subdivisions and grooves in the beat and the topliner is relying on that to drive the rhythmic feel. But also beats need to come in with pocket so there are space for the vocal melody to fit in. It would be good for writers to start without a beat or instrumentals and it would be good for beatmakers to practice leaving vocal pockets when starting with a beat first",

I feel like I\u2019ve been doing this for awhile and just started noticing recently when @Rob Domos  told me my run on sentence of a chorus was terrible (I still love you) because it wasn\u2019t perfectly symmetrical with the first half of the chorus. But to me, having that manic performance really struck home the idea that you\u2019re experiencing a blur of the night just to lead up to an extremely quiet post chorus to make it feel like you woke up alone. Both of those themes also reference the lyrics of course. Idk this doesn\u2019t make that much sense without context, but that\u2019s really been on my mind. I feel like I\u2019m broken for not making everything extremely simple but I like to think that even average listeners feel more from the performance and energy of things changing than just having something that\u2019s super predictable. I don\u2019t think people particularly like simple songs over songs that make them feel something.",

Melodically I tend to be like @Rob Domos and make everything as simple and predictable as possible, but sometimes it feels too easy and there is nothing that stands out. Lately my approach has been to use lyrics and chords to spice things up. For example, If I've got an idea for a lyric that I like, most times the metrics of it won't be incredibly predictable, and when I come up with a melody for it will be a bit more interesting than if I started out with the melody. Maybe then, for another section of the song I'll start with the melody and it'll be simpler. I think contrast is key. It really is an interesting topic!",

I\u2019ve worked with plenty of great singers with little-to-no comprehension for theory. While it can help, I find that for some personality types being too technical and trying to get them to learn theory is a turnoff and is never going to happen. Where does she fit on this spectrum?\n\nDo your best to assure her that she can open up and not be perfect right away. It sounds like she might be clamming up a little bit because she feels uncertain or unconfident. I always try to give my singers a place where they will feel comfortable throwing out any idea. Even horrible ones. It\u2019s okay to fail or fall on your face.  Maybe she needs some reassurance in order to open up. Let her know that she doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Many singers do better when they have a safe space to open up and attempt new things. Even Prince would tell his engineer to leave the room every time when it became time to track his vocals. Hendrix would hide himself behind a wall of gobos where nobody could see him.",

I move them toa diff folder which is linked to to my cloud service and let's anyone I share the link with download (w general guidekines for use) that way friends and ppl I work with can use them in their sessions or for fun. \n\nstart a new batch of stuff and repeat this process. some things I'm more attached to (for one reason or another) I might keep  longer to try to work on or pitch but that's it. \n\nup until maybe 5 months ago my process stopped after exportingthe tracks /Stems and using them in sessions.",

Her choices are informed by a lifetime of experience and point of view. It's almost ineffable at times. It feels like magic. Poetry is elusive. Most humans can barely do it themselves at that level. Asking these programs to perform at that level is... a lot.\n\nThere's a meme that I came across recently. It was the jazz saxophonist Chris Potter describing how in order to do what he does he has to be practicing at a level that is 10x beyond what he might actually play in a session. In a sense he needs creative and technical headroom to arrive at what the result that the rest of us witness.\n\nSome poetry follows this same principle. It's deeply, deeply ingrained and considered. The best poetry resonates and hints at things that aren't even explicitly mentioned. There's an iceberg of practice and experience beneath the surface of what we see. All Chat GPT sees is the surface. The final results that we're feeding it. It has no conception of the experiences that it's trying to replicate so it's approximations of something so complex and nuanced are likely to fall flat.",

Hell even 30 years ago Disney songs had beautiful arcs. Sing \u201cpart of your world\u201d from the little mermaid to yourself and feel the rollercoaster of the arc in that hook. It\u2019s magical.

Just like the same E major chord could be delivered in different voicings and different style of playing or instruments even. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just about paying attention to it more. I generally pay more attention to music than words by default, so that might be a factor that plays into it. \n\nTechnically- with drums for example, you can use the same tools, try to play it or sequence it with the feel as close to it as possible, and break down what\u2019s on it in terms of processing. If I go further, I can look at how the drums are interacting with the rest of the ensemble. If I just want to rip off the drums from a song, the first three will pretty much get me there. \n\nD\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo is an album I constantly go back to study for the band interaction. Questlove is usually playing straight eighth notes, and very simple pattern. but how open the hihat is, and where he\u2019s hitting, and when he makes the choices to pop the hihat out or kind of let it hide behind the instrumentation is very interesting. Perhaps subtle spontaneous decisions like that isn\u2019t really replicable but I just take it in physically and try to see why he made this by looking at what other instruments are doing. You can just pay attention to how he plays hi hat and go wild playing just the hat along",

And I typically don\u2019t touch lyrics anymore because I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m not that great at lyrics yet and if I don\u2019t have a line (which I usually don\u2019t\u2026.), it\u2019s better to leave it be for the longevity of relationship because lyrics can be one of the most personal things in music making because\u2026 it is literal. If you are more lyrics person, I think you can get a lot of value out of hanging out. \n\nFirst thing is creating safe space- and it really depends on person to person. Some people never open up, some people can open up immediately. In my experience, the more experienced they are - the more they tend to be the latter. I think how much time you spend on it can be dependent on this. You mentioned wanting to be more intentional, one idea that came to my mind is communicating this from the get go. Obviously there are going to be times where bring this up can be weird in the beginning of the session, but it should get them to think about opening up as part of work at the very least. It needs to be done carefully of course\n\nThe other part of it is understanding the person themselves. Their general vibe and energy. It\u2019s easier to tell with some folks, and it\u2019s harder to know what kind of person it is with some other folks. regarding this, I find diving into work right away helps feel it out. my job is often to constantly create ideas and inspirations. I can often gather some information from how they respond to different ideas. \n\nLastly, I used to spend a lot of time hanging up until very recently and I found it\u2019s so much more productive to just work and bond through that experience. Nature of work calls for connecting on a personal level, but it doesn\u2019t require it. I\u2019ve been trying to take it easy on getting closer with people, and focusing on the overall experience of collaboration and it has been making sessions more productive. So I plan on sticking with this way for a bit and see how it goes!",

I find that nearly all of the best songs I've written happen in about an hour long window of excitement. Sometimes you can stretch and get harmonies or punch in some vocals beyond that hour, but the excitement of a great idea is exhausting and it's hard to keep everyone 100% engaged for a long period of time. If I'm on hour 2 of a song and we're still trying to decide if we like a chorus, 100% of the time it's not a good song (in my experience).\n\nA BIG mistake I make (still) is \"oh we have tomorrow we can take a break and come back.\" It's not about being able to get the artist physically back, but getting everyone back into the emotional space. So much of what I need from an artist is the emotional focused to commit 100% to a vocal.",

There seemed to have been something magical about those lyrics and that particular kind of songwriting that really resonated with people and created an unbeblievable sense of unity. If you\u2018ve ever been in a club with hundreds of people singing along to Hangover on the top of their lungs you know what I mean. Raw power. It\u2018s easy to dismiss those songs as stupid but there seems to be something primal about them that really connects with people",

That said, since I've never had any of my songs do that, it's harder to trust my gut instinct on this one.  Thus, I wanted to get some other perspectives on the tactic. I've also rarely heard songs that implement it.",

The biggest unlock for me was to write an entire song\u2019s lyrics first, sometimes preceded with some journaling and/or research on the topic so I have real, meaningful things to draw from. I keep track of syllables etc so it lines up.\n\nOnce the lyrics are done and I\u2019m working on the song, I always end up having to change a lot, usually simplify and take out, but it\u2019s an easy problem when you have excess good lyrical content. As opposed to trying to summon something meaningful to fit a certain melody.\n\nSimple stuff like starting with getting the chorus right has also been super helpful, and keeping production to a minimum before the topline is finished.\n\nExcited to read more people\u2019s hacks here",

But, I have a friend who is a super prolific writer. He has his own artist project which I\u2019ve produced/mixed, and a few years ago had a publishing deal and has a good deal of writing credits. We\u2019re a really good yin/yang pair: he\u2019s focused on melody/lyrics/chords, I\u2019m focused on rhythm/sounds/texture/mix. We have a co-credit for a Suki Waterhouse song for the one and only explicitly \u201cwriting session\u201d we\u2019ve done together.\n\nI just reconnected with him and mentioned that I\u2019m about to be in a position where I could do more open-ended writing (/spec production?) sessions and would love to work with him again\u2014specifically on some projects that have approached me more in the writing stages, and most especially on reaching for bigger artists. And he\u2019s down!\n\nHere are my questions (and this is a *total* explain it to me like I\u2019m five situation\u2014I\u2019ve really struggled to make sense of things business/session flow-wise outside of getting paid for a discrete deliverable or a day rate):\n\nI don\u2019t feel a need to be too formal about things right now, but is this sort of partnership where we could pursue a joint publishing deal?\n\nMy main motivation is two-fold: keep a foot in production/engineering while I\u2019ve leaned more and more into mixing recently, and use our credits to get in a room with bigger artists. Am I way off here?\n\nAnything I\u2019m missing/obviously oblivious to?",

Generally it makes sense for everyone to have separate publishing deals as many songs get written with different people and different splits. You could certainly sign to the same publisher at the same time, just with separate deals. Or this person could sign you to their publisher with some finders fee type thing.\n\nWhat it sounds like you're doing is providing a great sounding board and musicianship for someone who is more primarily a songwriter? If so, you would just participate in any songs that are written in the room. If it's the sort of thing where he is really doing the bulk of the songwriting (like all the lyrics and melody, and you're helping with some of the music) you could certainly work out a deal where you get a smaller piece.",

    "content": "First most of what I'll have to say for this is built on the foundation of this course by Louis Bell of Post Malone, Halsey, and Justin Bieber #1 fame. In this course he spends hours going over exactly how he writes lyrics to his gibberish melodies. Then how he goes about pitching these ideas to artists. After he has 24k Goldn there for a few hours and they write another song to gibberish melody. And you can see how the process are alike and contrast. https://studio.com/classes/louis-bell/hitmaking-for-producers?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=ws_studio_brand_louis-bell_us_phrase&utm_content=studio&utm_term=louis%20bell%20studio&ref=m&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw-qi_BhBxEiwAkxvbkH_XdBqN7jbkwQK-0pisWV_MsC4-VSGH_iGfcL85MML5SoRwB01Q9xoCFl0QAvD_BwE",

It\u2019s more geared towards the personal, less towards industry, but I\u2019m so convicted that writing personal songs IS the way to reach others that I would definitely recommend it too.",

    "content": "And if you don\u2019t wanna go buying books, I\u2019d recommend possibly trying out the daily practice of object writing; you could even try it for a week or so, and you\u2019ll end up getting interesting imagery, some of which you may be able to use in your songs - but if you stick at it a bit (I find if I do it solidly in the mornings for a week or two it just warms my brain right up for writing throughout the day) it can help get your brain into that mode, so that when you go into your writing sessions later, your brain is already making those connections. Just an option of course - everyone\u2019s got their own way with lyric, it really is so personal. Whatever tools help, use em, whatever tools don\u2019t, chuck em. \n\nI just mention these things bc you talk about making the songs \u2018real\u2019, and I feel that - I love trying to get a song to feel properly grounded, with a sense of place and reality. Best solution I\u2019ve found is to just leave a bit of me in there - somehow it\u2019s like people can feel when songwriting is \u2018real\u2019, so I just try to make sure my heart is in/behind each line, keep them smooth, rinse repeat \n\nWould love to crack open this topic again too, curious on more peoples thoughts on this stuff, thanks for opening this up  @OJ,",

Is it as scattered as my process? Do they usually sit with an idea and write it linearly, line by line? A combination of things?\n\n\nI\u2019d love to read other people\u2019s processes and mindsets, if anyone would like to share.",
