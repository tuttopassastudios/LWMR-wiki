I designed the room with multilayer absorption all around. 1ft thick side walls, 2.5ft thick rear, and 6in ceiling (wish I had more ceiling height!) Monitors are our custom 3 way mains with hypex amps.",

Then\u2026 you know your shooting stuff in rew, and your like, hey I wonder what it looks like without my big desk. Then you move the desk and it\u2019s insanely better looking on the REW graph. Then you realize you have some old wood and a closet shelf that was gonna get tossed so you make a tiny desk and spend (waste?) 15 hours over the weekend that should have been spent on mixing renovating the studio room and moving things and taking measurements till you don\u2019t know what a anything even sounds like anymore . Anyway I feel like a Total psychopath because this is what I did Friday and Saturday all day and night. Desk is obviously in progress and I need to figure out a shelf for the hilo etc. thinking off to the side and low so I can reach it easily but it\u2019s not reflecting stuff. Also the back wall frame is full of pink fluffy now and covered in interm fabric till I figure out what I want it too like like.",

    "content": "Okay here we go\u2026\n\n@ALXCPH found a couple on my camera roll. Excuse quality, one is when I showed my parents the studio for first time. Couple (long) notes\u2026I\u2019m sure @Nomograph Mastering can expand if he chooses:\n\nUnf*ck designed the room. Ruairi you are incredible at this and I\u2019m very grateful. The subtleties in the trade offs when designing a room are something I urge everyone to consider deeply as I learned when working with them!\n\n1. Studio is built in my basement\u202613 feet long x 30 wide x 8 tall (including treatment). Back wall divides it length wise and makes the studio part 12x15 approx.\n\n2. All treatment is built in\u2026entire ceiling is stuffed with 9 inch pink fluffy, couple inch rockwool in the walls, tuned mass loaded vinyl behind the \u201chousings\u201d to L and R of listening position. Back wall is 6 inches of safe n sound in a frame built of 2x8s (by contractor) with a 24\u201d door. It\u2019s standing by friction just slid tight to ceiling. Quite precise measuring required to do that and make it sturdy so a door can open well\n\n3. Since I get asked a lot\u2026the wall finishes are acoustic felt board. Went that direction because install was way better than a fabric wall (they are firm and can be cut with an exacto knife). Also they are absorptive with no reflections\u2026caveats apply if that\u2019s good for a given space though (rather than the acoustically transparent fabric).\n\n5. @BatMeckley can confirm hard front wall was farrrr superior for me. I had a soft one (felt) against Ruairi advice since I preferred the aesthetic lol, but room was too dead. Uncomfortable. When I switched I could hear much more depth and energy but everything still as crisp and clear. Highly recommend! \n\nHope this helps some people on here. FYI we started my room from concrete block, bare bones so could frame things to hold treatment needed.\n\nWill circle back with some better pics when I\u2019m home. This community has helped me greatly.\n\nCheers friends!",

Most of what is bouncing back into the microphone is in that slappy high end area and will likely sound bad. With a guitar cab, the microphone will sit quite a bit lower to the ground -- so in theory this idea is even more useful. However, program-material depending, its likely whatever is coming out of the speaker is going to drastically overpower what gets slapped up from the floor.

    "content": "I think the attack wall solves the problem for people that can't build their room from scratch. As someone that just built a studio, building fake walls with insulation & membranes tucked behind aint cheap. And it's permanent. Having tube traps (or the ASC pressure traps, or whatever they are) are not a panacea -- but rather a scalable, portable method of getting an untreated room in the ballpark. I've found with tube traps that more is not necessarily better and you just don't know till you get in there and shoot it. My friend Andrew Maury raves about his. He's gets amazing results and he loves moving around his setup every few months just because he likes tweaking... and the attack wall allows him to do this. So -- if you're building a studio from the ground up, there are absolutely better options. But if you're hopping around from space to space and don't feel like spending $10-15k on framing, fabric, rockwool, & building limp mass membranes... these are a terrific option.",

Basically you make a box with rough plywood, brace it, add rockwool, stretch fabric over it, add trim pieces and then attach the 2 by 4s with wheels. \n\nSome tips:\n-The finish pieces should be a little over an inch longer than the internal frame pieces: 1 inch to account for the added length of 2 sheets of 1/2 inch plywood and a little extra to get over the fabric. This time I cut them 1.25 inches longer and had to sand down the top and bottom trim pieces a little.\n-Predrilll pilot holes as much as possible to avoid splittling the thin plywood. For the finish pieces I also did \u201cdiy countersinks\u201d using a larger drill bit in order to have the screws be flush with the wood. \n-Stretch the fabric tight but not so tight that it warps the frame in the middle. Start by stapling on the long sides at each end of the middle brace, then work out from the center stopping a foot or two away from the corners. Then staple the centers of the short ends and finish with the corners. I staple every 6 inches or so and each time I add a staple I try to pull the fabric so that it is tight in two diffent dirrections (pullling away from the center of the panel). The way I\u2019m describing this might be confusing and I can elaborate further if it is helpful.\n-The 2 by 4s at the bottom are 15\" long so they extend an extra 3 inches on each side of the panel and that ended up feeling very stable.",

    "content": "@peterlabberton I\u2019d say if you do go attack wall, @cian riordan is correct to say the mix set up will ultimately take up more space. My room is about 13x13, I think, and the attack wall takes up most of the usable space minus a storage area in the back. \n\nThe second drawing will probably be most accurate. Also, don\u2019t feel like the attack wall is the \u201conly\u201d solution - especially if it\u2019s a stretch financially. There are other options at multiple price ranges. It could be worth getting a consultation from someone once you get into the space.",

Will of course need to adapt as I get in the room and listen, but I'm excited *and* need to minimize downtime between studios, so I'm mapping stuff out as best I can so I can hit the ground running.\n\nI'm thinking I'll build some fiberglass/rockwool panels on stands (the four panels freestanding by the mix position) and mimic some of the idea behind the attack wall: kill reflections closer to the listening position rather than at the walls. This way I can keep the fireplace and windows from being covered up, and have some gobos to move around when needed for tracking. The small desk to the left of the mix position will be a rack for gear, the large rectangular thingy in the upper right will be an upright piano. I'll pack in some DIY tube traps around the monitors, and hang two 4'x2' panels I already own over the mix position. I'll also put two slightly smaller panels over the drums, and two more on the wall behind the drums. The french doors and the sliding doors to the closet behind the couch will have heavy curtains.",

It\u2019ll close up your pores so the fibers can\u2019t work as deep. The longest part of the process was using a jigsaw to cut the wooden caps for each end, this is absolutely needed for the traps to work properly and I\u2019d recommend using a good quality construction adhesive like the gorilla stuff.

It was a major purchase and after lots of sleepless nights I decided that it was not the house and neighborhood I wanted to be in. We absolutely love our current little house my girlfriend owns, and we love this neighborhood in Nashville (Wedgewood Houston).  I was excited for the bigger studio room, but it is what it is, and I feel really great about this decision.\n\nWith that said, this means my current attic studio needs a major upgrade asap. I am ready to get to work. First thing I plan to do is either shave down this insulation so it is flat to the studs and cover with fabric (it is 6in deep), or remove it entirely on my workspace side and replace it with Roxul insulation. It is definitely quite dead sounding up here, but I am wondering if Roxul will outperform this spray foam for the type of absorption I need?  I imagine this is an easy yes, but I wanted to check here first before I dig it all out (not that hard). I only plan to dig out the studio side of the room. I am moving the monitors up against the wall, and considering making that front wall reflective with wood. My rear wall is 26ft behind me.  I was thinking of building a big ass bass trap for the rear of the room to put above and behind the water heater.  And of course, a Cloud above the mix position. The room is 8ft tall in center, and a long A Frame shape. I have had that green fabric covering the insulation currently.  I tore it down to take these pics.\n\nMy main questions is: Should I build upright gobos for my side reflections, or would just replacing the current roof walls with Roxul likely be good enough?  This room is not ideal, and I do not expect it to be perfect, just good enough. Thank you all. Sorry it is so damn messy as well.  It is getting a major purge and reorganization stat.",

On the outside of the door, where there will be trim, are there any special actions I need to take to get as good of a seal and block as much sound as possible? I.E. Fill in any holes with wood or foam or what, then put up trim over it?\n\n-There will be two sets of doors at the end of this\n-My good buddy is young but talented at this stuff, so he's being very cool with doing weird stuff like this!",

Cedar shims and a gap area should of been used to level off the door before securing it. Nothing is ever perfectly square, the door, the wood, the ground. So you need allowances with doors. Youll never notice the corner of a wall meeting slighlty out of plum. But a door always shows it. You can see how the top of the door isn't running level from right to left with the image your finger is pointing at the hole. #2 You can add any expanding insulation foam, or clear caulk to fill those small slots. Once covered in trim though. I doubt much sound if any is going to make through the trim and through those small holes",
