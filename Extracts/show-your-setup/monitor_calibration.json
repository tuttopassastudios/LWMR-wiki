Then I was like\u2026 hey I should use this opportunity to get the house super dirty and build a full back wall bass trap like I\u2019ve been meaning to. Then\u2026 you know your shooting stuff in rew, and your like, hey I wonder what it looks like without my big desk. Then you move the desk and it\u2019s insanely better looking on the REW graph. Then you realize you have some old wood and a closet shelf that was gonna get tossed so you make a tiny desk and spend (waste?) 15 hours over the weekend that should have been spent on mixing renovating the studio room and moving things and taking measurements till you don\u2019t know what a anything even sounds like anymore . Anyway I feel like a Total psychopath because this is what I did Friday and Saturday all day and night. Desk is obviously in progress and I need to figure out a shelf for the hilo etc. thinking off to the side and low so I can reach it easily but it\u2019s not reflecting stuff. Also the back wall frame is full of pink fluffy now and covered in interm fabric till I figure out what I want it too like like.",

    "content": "I think the attack wall solves the problem for people that can't build their room from scratch. As someone that just built a studio, building fake walls with insulation & membranes tucked behind aint cheap. And it's permanent. Having tube traps (or the ASC pressure traps, or whatever they are) are not a panacea -- but rather a scalable, portable method of getting an untreated room in the ballpark. I've found with tube traps that more is not necessarily better and you just don't know till you get in there and shoot it. My friend Andrew Maury raves about his. He's gets amazing results and he loves moving around his setup every few months just because he likes tweaking... and the attack wall allows him to do this. So -- if you're building a studio from the ground up, there are absolutely better options. But if you're hopping around from space to space and don't feel like spending $10-15k on framing, fabric, rockwool, & building limp mass membranes... these are a terrific option.",

Of course I am sorta biased because I did (and my project was not building a completely new structure but still decently involved in a new house we bought) but I promise you they saved me so much time, headache and made my investment absolutely worth it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s much more about the trade-offs and things they are so good at helping with than just an acoustics plan. For instance, in my case they talked me out of buying more expensive speakers and we put that into the room treatment and finishing it to be a wonderful space to work. At the time I just trusted their experience but now that it\u2019s done I see the wisdom in it. So regardless if you work with them please consider all the trade-offs, both short term and long!",
