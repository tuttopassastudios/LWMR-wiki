I guess obvious it also had to be porous/breathable. But the double wrap may still be cheaper than the $$ stuff where you are?",

I live in an old upstairs apartment where monitors are not an option other than short term low volume listening and rely on these for 90% of my work.\n\nAlso, for a full chain explanation I am using Audient id44 -> Schiit Modi/Magni Heresy stack via SPDIF, they don't take a lot of power to run though and could probably run off most audio interface headphone amps",

That helps me a ton in terms of accurate referencing and hearing wtf is going on in the low end. \n\nMy biggest gripe is that they aren\u2019t very sturdy. Like I\u2019ve literally just been sitting there and had the driver fall off the headband, so the driver falls off my head. I have to tighten the screws on them literally every time I use them because they get so floppy, and I\u2019ve had the screws bend over time so much so that they had to mail me new screws because the original screws no longer even functioned. \n\nThe scooped high mids can take a little getting used to but I tend to mix too relaxed and recessed in the high mids anyways so that actually worked out in my favor. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019d recommend them.",

At the corners at back of the subs it\u2019s like 2 inches\n\nAs per @Nomograph Mastering advice\u2026as I understand this is so the low end stays in phase as much as possible since low freqs are not directional. The shorter distance to wall means a shorter distance for them to bounce since they are also shooting backwards. Thus they meet with the waves going toward listening position ASAP and produce as little phasing of the lows as possible! More complicated than that of course (for example this also makes the bass more present) but it\u2019s the understanding I have \n\nIf you meant just the wood\u2026it\u2019s screwed into the wall so it won\u2019t rattle so there is no space between the wood and the felt (and drywall behind) that it covers",

It made a difference that I can hear in my work. 10 years ago, probably not so much. You could have handed me Fuller\u2019s espresso machine and I woulda made mud.

    "content": "@Johnny I as Ruairi says there are many many trade offs...my house is an odd quad level thing, so only the living room is above my studio, all the bedrooms/other spaces are sorta on the \"other side\". You can't hear the studio in there, but you can definitely hear it if you're in the living room above it. For our family this is fine (wife generally works away from home, I can work late and she can sleep, etc).\n\nIn my case this house worked really well for our family, and honestly my room has worked far far better than I expected, it is not the thing that will hold me back for a long time. And if it is that means I've been wildly successful. But more importantly than all of that I have peace that I've made it as good as can be possibly achieved given the space, and that is something I am deeply thankful to Ruairi for, and is maybe the single biggest factor in me being able to just dive into mastering head first. That confidence is key.\n\nIn my case for what I do and my wife does it works very well (her office is on the \"other side\" and can take calls while I work no problem). Which I would argue, the functionality of that I mean, is a huge reason why a studio would be successful too. And we could afford this house, the money to pour into the room, etc. All of that comes into play, so I'd think about that deeply and what that all means to you.\n\nFor example, our house is on a beautiful river so I can just pop back there and clear my head during the day. And that's worth a lot to me too and my overall happiness, my wife's, etc. Only you can weigh all that for yourself and where the studio fits\n\nI also stuffed the entire ceiling which seems to have helped a bit IMO for isolation (not just the ceiling in \"the studio\")...I don't think that has any actual acoustic benefit to the room response but it does seem to mitigate some of the bleed going to the rest of the house.\n\nMy preferred listening level is quite low too though, which helps it not being a problem!",

So that probably plays a big role in how my spot turned out too.",

Screws,hardware and sundries!!!You often forget to add this to material costs and man do they add up fast. \n\nSets of spare parts (connectors, plugs, switches etc) drum heads, strings, reeds, batteries of all shapes and sizes. \n\nOn that note I\u2019ve got to go and buy some batteries and tape lol",

A good seal is also key, regular weather stripping and a solid stop will help here. It can be a good idea to install the door first and then close and fix the seals into position after to get the best seal. You can get some fancy bottom seals that lift as you open and then drop back into place and seal when you close but those are not really needed most of the time. The standard solid bottom seals you can get from a hardware store will do. For handles simple pull handles or bars are great if you don\u2019t need the ability to lock. If you do check out solid mortised locksets.",

I'd probably just experiment with a larger listening triangle. Both great rooms!",

Thanks, Noah! \u2764\ufe0f  My gf and I (and now our little one) are on a bit of a journey to find a place that really feels like home (chose to live a bit of a nomadic life until we find that place). So, we've been trying out different spots we like by moving every six months or so, just to get a feel for them. The idea is to eventually settle down, especially for our son, before he starts school. We always try to pick places with mountains, cause that's what we love most.",

I definitely wouldn\u2019t have bought it if we still lived up in the city, it\u2019s too big\u2026but we\u2019re down near the beach now and spend a ton of time there. I surf and love camping. Having the bed for projects around the house has been great. And the tech is really cool. Being able to plug in to regular outlets anywhere on the truck is awesome. Haven\u2019t had any power outages yet but I\u2019m setup if the house goes down to plug in the fridge + a few things to keep us going for a few days. Also, the frunk has a drain plug and you can use it like a cooler.\n\nIf anyone is in the market for one, the incentives are ridiculous atm. I\u2019m paying the same amount on this lease that I was for my Mazda cx5 and that thing is basically 1/3 the price. I guess ford has had trouble getting people to buy & lease these? But with the EV credit + fords employee pricing it\u2019s a steal.",
