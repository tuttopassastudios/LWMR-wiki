He wired up all my pedals, synths, and preamps to a couple of patch bays so I can throw signal all around the room in any order (complete with right-angle cables so I can use them with the desk doors closed). He also built MIDI lines to send clock from my DAW to the pedals and we upgraded the room to Mio MIDI-over-Ethernet units. Several other creature comforts that allow me to think less, like routing a headphone connection underneath the right side of my desk instead of the left where my interface is, adding a second one by the piano, and ready-to-go cables for guitars, synths and microphones already plugged in where they need to be.\n\nI'm going to run out of reasons not to call this studio \"done\" soon.",

I am new to the community and happy to have finally taken the jump into the discord after being an avid listener since the beginning.\n\nJust finished building my studio about half a year ago. I run a hybrid setup where everything is always connected and ready to go. All recording paths are accessed via an XLR patch-bay. Mixbus/Mastering gear is controlled by a Dangerous Liaison. Conversion is done via MADI and AES/EBU. Headphone CUE\u2019s are analog and via AVB. I like having everything connected and mic\u2019ed up because I notice that I only use the stuff that I can access quickly while producing/mixing. I went through a lot of trial and error building and working in this studio (been in this location for 1.5 years) so if anyone needs any input I would be happy to help!",

Have you thought of speaker stands for the ADAMs? You know there are better speakers than ADAMs? People really like the Kalis. Do you ever worry about resonances off the rubbermade table? Also whats that ribbon mic pointing at? looks like its just setup in the middle, doing nothing. You should try two mics on the congas... I hear Neumann mics are good for this. Also make sure that ceiling fan is off, could create wierd flutters. Cool studio though, bet it sounds great.",

Attack and release work kind of like the UnFairchild\u2014the \u201cspeed\u201d control sets the general range, and then you can fine tune. Top is a Pultec inspired tube EQ with a unique mid band: instead of selecting the frequency and Q, you select the bottom range of the band and the top range of the band with the \u201ccorner\u201d controls. You can also turn it into a low or high shelf with the \u201ccurve\u201d control. It can do really bold moves; I think he said it can boost up to 20dB, at least on certain bands, and just playing around it can do a lot. I\u2019ve only just given them a rough run through but they are so far very very cool! (Plus I love the hand written controls.)",

I\u2019ll also, per Gerhard\u2019s recommendation, be covering up those two little alcoves next to the windows so the front wall is all flush (these weird cutouts for the windows are required for property line setback/emergency escape reasons, but there\u2019s nothing but a fence and our neighbor\u2019s yard on the other side, so whatever).",

Just got nostalgic, having read today so many people building their rooms. I wish you all the best on your journey to having your rooms sounding as good as they can! It's a tough endavour but totally worth it in the end. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWhat I'm most proud of, is the fact that all the rooms were built by myself & a friend. Didn't hire any construction crew. \ud83d\ude04 I'm hoping this can inspire some of you who are in the process.",

    "content": "So, to update this: spent most of my time being a runner and doing runner things. We had an issue with an inadequate scented candle, so to target we went. Had to find a nice vegan friendly restaurant open at 11:30 PM which was a fun task. The engineer who ran the session is one of the few I\u2019m chill with, so he very briefly introduced me to swizz as \u201cEvan, the runner who makes some dope synth pop\u201d (alicia was warming up, but swizz was real down to earth and nice. very focused) and i actually got to catch a couple glimpses of what they were doing in the studio when I wasn\u2019t calling restaurants and polling my vegan friends for food recs. We actually spent more time communicating with engineers out East to get files fixed and communicating with a personal assistant of some kind who stopped by before to make sure things were going smoothly. \n\nAll that to say what little I did actually see was sick. Swizz goes crazyyyy on an MPC, man. Wow. That was fun to hear.\n\nAlso @cian riordan was right. I\u2019ve never heard our nearfields work that hard like ever. It was belligerently loud. Fletcher-Munson be damned lmao. I\u2019m sure they fired up the bigger shit when I left (unfortunately running does not pay the bills, or anyone really).",

But I can't deny that my heros made great shit on them. There seem to be 2 common denominators I've seen for ns10 people. Either you came up in big studios and they were always there as a reliable reference and you learned them over time. In this context part of the sound of the ns10 is actually the desk reflection. Or you learned from a mentor who worked on them and picked up all the voodoo tricks that helped make them translate. Anybody who had a real mentor likely understands ns10s because they were ubiquitous to genX and before. I'm trying to understand if there's any use to a 25 year old now who's never been in a big studio or had a mentor and wants to do good work. I was the first to discourage someone from getting them yesterday in monitoring. Was my take wrong?",

Have had it for maybe a year and a half, tracked vocals with maybe 3-5 singers with it. I like it because it\u2019s very flexible without leaning on any DSP wizardry, which was a selling point when I was shopping around for a quality mic that could cover a lot of bases. Really love it as a center drum overhead. Have used it in the B mode on a dimed bass cab and it did great. Would love to put it up to a couple classics and have a good singer shoot them all out to feel like have a better sense of it, but my metric in this room and situation is: does it do the job? And so far 9/10 it does.",

I think it is 14x15. I will be there next week to take proper measurements. I already know it will be difficult to find a sweet spot that also works with me doing all my tracking and drum recording in here, as I do a lot of full-stack producing where I play most everything. Space is going to be tight, but I have worked out of much smaller spaces. I am starting to budget out the project of what my acoustics will likely cost me.",

The small desk to the left of the mix position will be a rack for gear, the large rectangular thingy in the upper right will be an upright piano. I'll pack in some DIY tube traps around the monitors, and hang two 4'x2' panels I already own over the mix position. I'll also put two slightly smaller panels over the drums, and two more on the wall behind the drums. The french doors and the sliding doors to the closet behind the couch will have heavy curtains.",

    "content": "So here\u2019s the roundup on my dumb drum thing. This is a scrappy little experiment on my part to see if I can get a convincing drum sound in my little drum room. Before starting this, I had the idea in my mind that if a room is good for mixing, it must be good for recording! *Insert Game Show Buzzer* I ran into many of the things I didn\u2019t like about the Barefoot Studio B Live room \u2014 and those things were exaggerated by a factor of 10. First of all, my room is very dead by design. It treats me great in mixing, but made for a real challenge when trying to get *some* sort of drum personality. I was also working with a pretty shitty old premier kit that hadn\u2019t seen the light of day in half a decade. Shitty cymbals, very quickly tuned heads \u2014 I wasn\u2019t setting myself up for success\u2026 but whatever.\n\nThe setup was a little ridiculous (minus a few utilitarian pieces):\nKick: Beta 52 -> Scully 280\nSnare: SM57 -> Scully 280\nOH Mono: Coles 4038 -> Ampex 351 -> 1176 (not compressing, just to trim gain before \u2018tools)\nOH L/R: U67s -> UTA pre (thanks Matt!)\nKick Room: U47 -> UTA Pre (again\u2026)\n\nThis is where I ended up, without mixing, and with some quick playing and utility EQ/balancing. No compression except a limiter to bring up the level. While the actual drums themselves don\u2019t sound amazing, I really struggled with getting any sort of energy out of the drums\u2026 it all just got sucked out. \n\nHere are the results if you care (don\u2019t judge my shitty playing)\n\nI think if it do this again I would:\n1) Have a better sounding kit. Turns out, shit in.. shit out. I knew this. We all know this. But here I am.\n2) Maybe put some sheets of plywood around to create some surface in the room. Just give it some life.\n3) Not use the Scully. It\u2019s so hard to get them to not sound distorty\u2026 I just don\u2019t have enough pres on hand to have clean path for everything. Mix studio living.\n\nSo it goes\u2026",

    "content": "I have a Hilo goes AES to speakers and as my send/capture for the Massive Passive...you can't see it here but there is a rack under the screen where it sits. I have a side car off the side (the walls look pretty tight but they are actually the unf*ck mass loaded vinyl L things, so the room opens up more behind them). The sidecar is back from those...its got a apogee symphony taking the ins for my synths (also not really pictured -- just hangarounds from my production days for the fun of it sometimes), Hazelrigg VLC in there too.\n\nThere is sorta a whole room behind the listening position...its 30 feet long with a floating wall for absorption about 15 feet in so the studio is like 13x15 but acoustically its larger if that makes sense.\n\nI do use streamdeck...but mainly to switch quickly between the hot ref in Wavelab and my master. I've gotten deep into Applescript which essentially handles all of the other Wavelab processes...it's almost finished but my streamdeck will essentially just launch those applications to do what I need. So I'd say it's very useful, but the coding I've been able to do will render it sorta meaningless for me (though convienent, I use it for other things like navigating websites when doing client outreach, etc which is very handy and makes my workflow like an order of magnitude quicker).\n\nChair is hag capisco. I love it. Had a serious back injury when I was younger so I'm pretty dialed into having things be ergonomic and I find it's great. Actually kinda rather uncomfortable...in a good way. You can't really slouch. Took some getting used to but it's interesting",

Right now it will take in all my project info, use that to create the file structure, upsample my originals using RX, create an entry in my Google Sheet project tracking app, create an invoice for the project with all the naming/pricing, then create, move the files into, and prep/save the Wavelab session for me.\n\nIt also copies all the project info into Wavelab and there is another script that names all the tracks/sets up the render too. All from that one data entry point in the beginning (mine is currently just an Applescript since it's still being worked on).\n\nYou gave me the initial idea, Nathan Dantzler at the Hit Lab gave me the idea to tie it all into the business backend.\n\nThank you so much, it's actually unbelievable how efficient it is, and there is only one possible point of failure for naming/QC which is easy to check.\n\nExcited to see what your app does, I'm sure I'll grab a cool idea or two from it!!",

I measured flat but always have a -3db from 7.5k on the kii control",

The middle panel does help but still sounds worse to me in here than having two 2x4 panels on the front. Would putting the panels not behind the speakers but still covering a little more of the front wall be a potential compromise for having the speakers right on the wall while still sounding \"right\" to me? Or does that still defeat the purpose of the \"No treatment on the front wall\" rule?",

Its really hard to a/b directly but i've tried a few times and thats the conclusion i've drawn.

Please just let me know if there\u2019s a better thread for this sort of thing. \n\nI\u2019d be extremely grateful for any feedback! Here\u2019s some info: \n\n- I am currently moving my home studio to this basement space that is about 400 SQ feet. Concrete floor and walls except for the front wall shown in this picture - that is drywall as it separates the rest of the basement. \n\n- The ceiling joists are exposed and are about 7.5\u201d deep. \n\n- My primary function for this room will be mixing, but I will also be doing smaller overdubs like piano and vocals. \n\nCurrently, after painting the walls and floor, my plan is as follows: \n- Stuff the ceiling joists with insulation \u2014 probably Safe N Sound\u2026 thoughts on that choice? \n\n- Cover the joists with fabric from Gilford of Maine. \n\n- Figure out how to drill into concrete \ud83d\ude02 Then put panels everywhere. Most of my panels are about 4\u201d thick and are comprised of the safe n sound insulation. \n- Put some big rugs down but also leave a bit of the concrete exposed if possible cuz I like the look. Haha \n\n- My monitoring set up is NS10M\u2019s (don\u2019t laugh) with an Avantone CLA-100 amp and a PreSonus T10 sub. I\u2019ve got an Apollo 8 Duo and Apollo Twin X Quad. \n\nThat concludes my plan so far. Am I on the right track? \ud83d\ude33 \n\nI really appreciate any feedback you\u2019re willing to give. \ud83d\ude4f",

I\u2019m doing most of my work right here these days if I can\u2019t get studio time at my buddys space. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the mixes and masters I\u2019ve been able to do in this little corner. I set up some gobos and tube traps I have in the closet when I\u2019m getting deep into the mix and it\u2019s all been working out as best as it can for the situation at hand.\nNS10\u2019s have the cap mod. \n\nWhen I need to track my guitar amps I completely isolate them with long cables and treatment directly in my closet or I will close off the bathroom and treat them in there as well as capture the natural reflection in our bathroom. My wife and kids are so incredibly sensitive and generous to me during this time to even let me still be able to work and make this happen while the studio build is on hold and we\u2019re having to make things work.",

Some science I don't really understand behind that. There's a huberman lab out there somewhere about it. I backlit my screen display with blue leds as well. Honestly one of the best things when I actually stick to it is trying to never sit for longer than an hour. Even just a 5 minute stand up walk around helps me immensely.

The converters are VERY good with no discernable difference between A32 and the RME UFX+  ...  but it's my mixer bridge more than modular.  The modular routes to an old Apogee, and can then MADI into the mixer (if you wanted to get real tweaky with EQ or use compressors).  \n\nAs far as levels go...    the A32 does something I had no experienced with other converters, and I love it.  You can adjust the sensitivy of the analog input...  Here's a better explanation from the manual\n\n> The analog inputs of the A32 DANTE can each be set to different\n> sensitivities. You can choose between three reference levels: +4dBu,\n> +13dBu and +20dBu. Using the DSP, you can additionally set the\n> reference levels from -8dBu to +20dBu in 1 dB steps. The DSP always\n> calculates the optimum configuration. For example, if you set +12dBu,\n> the analog reference will be set to +13dBu and the signal will be\n> attenuated by 1dB.\n\nThat would work magic with eurorack levels.  I use it sometimes so that I can overdrive the Trident and keep the channel direct outputs under the limiter's clipping stage. Helps when you want to be abusive in analgo but not worry about converters clipping.",

You can see how the top of the door isn't running level from right to left with the image your finger is pointing at the hole. #2 You can add any expanding insulation foam, or clear caulk to fill those small slots.
