He wired up all my pedals, synths, and preamps to a couple of patch bays so I can throw signal all around the room in any order (complete with right-angle cables so I can use them with the desk doors closed). He also built MIDI lines to send clock from my DAW to the pedals and we upgraded the room to Mio MIDI-over-Ethernet units. Several other creature comforts that allow me to think less, like routing a headphone connection underneath the right side of my desk instead of the left where my interface is, adding a second one by the piano, and ready-to-go cables for guitars, synths and microphones already plugged in where they need to be.\n\nI'm going to run out of reasons not to call this studio \"done\" soon.",

    "content": "Hey guys! I am new to the community and happy to have finally taken the jump into the discord after being an avid listener since the beginning.\n\nJust finished building my studio about half a year ago. I run a hybrid setup where everything is always connected and ready to go. All recording paths are accessed via an XLR patch-bay. Mixbus/Mastering gear is controlled by a Dangerous Liaison. Conversion is done via MADI and AES/EBU. Headphone CUE\u2019s are analog and via AVB. I like having everything connected and mic\u2019ed up because I notice that I only use the stuff that I can access quickly while producing/mixing. I went through a lot of trial and error building and working in this studio (been in this location for 1.5 years) so if anyone needs any input I would be happy to help!",

Have you thought of speaker stands for the ADAMs? You know there are better speakers than ADAMs? People really like the Kalis. Do you ever worry about resonances off the rubbermade table? Also whats that ribbon mic pointing at? looks like its just setup in the middle, doing nothing. You should try two mics on the congas... I hear Neumann mics are good for this. Also make sure that ceiling fan is off, could create wierd flutters. Cool studio though, bet it sounds great.",

    "content": "Protecting Ruairi.\n|| So, interesting enough I had the exact same impression as @chrissorem but came to the totally opposite conclusion. The 420\u2019s are truly fantastic monitors. They do the low end thing that I like out of the PMC 6-2\u2019s without that weird pressed against the glass flatness that I hear in them. A much more pleasant high end too. And their sub information is staggering, especially if you can get some distance from the speakers. But. They do run a bit lean in the 250-500hz range and FOR ME that would cause me to make poor mix decisions. And they really come alive when you\u2019re farther away from them than would be practical in my particular space. For that reason sharks, im out.\n\nThe PMC 6\u2019s however blew me away. Leaps and bounds better for me than the 6-2, and I could work on them without a sub even though I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be better with. They present to me the info as I need to hear it, and complement what I get from the ATC\u2019s nicely. They feel very \u201cas the consumer hears it\u201d. Like my AirPods. ||\n\nAnd so, I think I might be buying a new pair of speakers.",

That being said I\u2019m keeping my two two 6\u2019s and the Neumann 420\u2019s are filling the role that I\u2019m looking for, which is a full range cabinet.  The 420\u2019s frequency spectrum feels very top to bottom and very open.  The low end detail is very zoomed in. I definitely can hear more detail. The mid range also feels very detailed and the top end is nice and open but they are as bright as the PMC\u2019s but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing any information.  After listening to various songs on the 420\u2019s I thought damn these sound nice, and at the same time I thought but is that good? Like how will they respond actually working on them. Will they help my mixes or will they just sound good? So far they have been revealing and translating quite well. I was concerned about the 300-500hz. Feeling a little tucked in when listening to  finished mixes but as I put them to work I felt like they did show that info as well.  I really dig them and will likely buy them. But I think they might be a bit big for a single set of speakers and will still want to work on some  near fields. They definitely show me different things.",

We actually spent more time communicating with engineers out East to get files fixed and communicating with a personal assistant of some kind who stopped by before to make sure things were going smoothly. \n\nAll that to say what little I did actually see was sick. Swizz goes crazyyyy on an MPC, man. Wow. That was fun to hear.\n\nAlso @cian riordan was right. I\u2019ve never heard our nearfields work that hard like ever. It was belligerently loud.

    "content": "Part of what I did today too was put the center of my Sterling desk precisely on the centerline of the room and precisely the same distance from the front wall so I could use it as a reference. Once I got that locked in, I used my Bosch double laser thingy mounted to a tripod to reference to the room centerline and then also cast a horizontal line across the room, across the front of the speaker platform. Since both stands and platforms were now actually level, it was easy to see that the platform of the right speaker stand was slightly out vs. the left. So I had to very gingerly and carefully fuck with the platform to get it lined up. Then fine tuning of leveling with the feet. Then, using the double laser thing at the centerline, I verified the height at the speaker platforms by using that translucent target thing to make sure the cross-line it was casting, hit the target as expected (it did) . I did have to do a bunch of nudging of the right speaker stand to match its position from the right and rear wall to match the left speaker's position, which was a pain int he ass.\n\nDefinitely an ordeal and was made much easier with the tools I have. Pretty satisfying seeing identical measurements from the same reference points on either speaker stand.",

Either you came up in big studios and they were always there as a reliable reference and you learned them over time. In this context part of the sound of the ns10 is actually the desk reflection. Or you learned from a mentor who worked on them and picked up all the voodoo tricks that helped make them translate. Anybody who had a real mentor likely understands ns10s because they were ubiquitous to genX and before. I'm trying to understand if there's any use to a 25 year old now who's never been in a big studio or had a mentor and wants to do good work. I was the first to discourage someone from getting them yesterday in monitoring. Was my take wrong?",

For people like Matt, they're working to solve problems on a different tier than most people need to worry about for awhile. It's a deck of cards, and if you start tweaking the angles of your cards on the third level, but your foundation isn't solid, no amount of tweaking is going to fix that and it's still going to fall apart on you. Cian can start to solve his low end integration only after years of having a great room. And he had to get to the point that he had the great room in which the difference between an Unf*ck'd, mismatched pair of subs vs. integrated PMCs was even on his radar of things to worry about. (Putting a lot of words in his mouth now.)\n\nWith the Squire thing - there are 1000 variablels and skills to be learned before you reach the ceiling of how far you can get with it. People like to shit on the Apollos here, but we all know plenty of great records were made with them, despite not being \"the best\" sounding. It's fun to fixate on the minutiae, but it seldom gets to the root of the issue of what's holding you back.",

As someone that just built a studio, building fake walls with insulation & membranes tucked behind aint cheap. And it's permanent. Having tube traps (or the ASC pressure traps, or whatever they are) are not a panacea -- but rather a scalable, portable method of getting an untreated room in the ballpark. I've found with tube traps that more is not necessarily better and you just don't know till you get in there and shoot it. My friend Andrew Maury raves about his. He's gets amazing results and he loves moving around his setup every few months just because he likes tweaking... and the attack wall allows him to do this. So -- if you're building a studio from the ground up, there are absolutely better options. But if you're hopping around from space to space and don't feel like spending $10-15k on framing, fabric, rockwool, & building limp mass membranes... these are a terrific option.",

The ns10 thing is just an incorrectly designed crossover (because a proper one would\u2019ve been too expensive). \u201cTightness\u201d just comes from the lack of bottom end. Yes, because it\u2019s sealed but only in the sense that sealed doesn\u2019t provide extended bottom end. The \u201ctransient\u201d benefits of sealed don\u2019t really come through. I spent a lot of time designing a proper crossover for them. It can be done but then they just sound like cheap speakers and their usefulness is gone for someone who\u2019s used to it and relies on the problem",

Maybe 6-2\u2019s are the right move instead of twotwo8\u2019s and subs.\n\nI can build and construct whatever between myself and friends and family that are experienced or professionals\n\n2)  goals:\nI want to be full time making records / mixing records in the next 5 years, aka quit the day job. Ideally working* at as high a level as I can achieve not being in LA/Nashville/NYC. I\u2019d love have the best sounding room and mixes in KCMO at least (all ego aside) I want to help my friends make records sound and feel better than they ever could have imagined. \n\n3) budget:\nGreat question. Willing to spend what I need to, but need to be really cost effective where I can be (AKA Labor). Maybe 15-20k on building/consult/etc. i don\u2019t include speakers in that budget because I\u2019d sell my PMC\u2019s and subs probably to find if I need to.\n\nAlso way open to changing this, adjusting things\u2026I just need a place I can do high level work without questioning the room or sound.

    "content": "so OLED is where every pixel is its own backlight, microLED is that but without burn-in (but also like $100k for one), and miniLED is an in between. Essentially it's a QLED (lots of colors and bright af) with a ton of backlight zones/full array local dimming. Essentially it has great color depth and brightness without OLED problems, though it doesn't quite match the pixel response (but is still quite fast) and it's not quite as many backlight zones (since not every single pixel is its own backlight like on OLED and microLED). Hopefully that's not too much word vomit lol\n\nAt the end of the day, I have an OLED in the living room and a miniLED as a computer monitor and for everyday use as a monitor this is great. The advantages you'd gain of going with an actual monitor that has DisplayPort are good if your computer doesn't have HDMI 2.1 since you'd then be able to hit 120Hz at 4k and it would feel quite buttery smooth",

Not flat by any means but paired with sonarworks they feel surprisingly great. After being introduced to ATCs I\u2019ll get to those towards the end of year. I\u2019ll have to shoot them out to pmc of course!",

I scored my whole set in 2 batches (16 tubes, 3 speaker stands) for roughly $4500 total - which is still pricey but a great \u201cdeal.\u201d Also, they make my Apartment\u2019s basement bedroom usable. \n\nThey lock you into a very specific aesthetic and ergonomic setup, which I have found interesting to navigate (placing a desk, can\u2019t adjust speaker height, etc.).\n\nThey also sound great for tracking! I have used them while tracking drums, harp, vocals, and other things with excellent results.",

I think you could get better ergonomics and potentially better sound from other studio design options, but the flexibility is great. They are definitely not a magic bullet to get a \u201cflat room\u201d either and placement / quantity can affect things greatly. \n\nAndrew Maury was the one who inspired my initial purchase! He does fantastic work on them and was definitely a great resource as I was looking into them. He shared this video with Greg from Kush audio which was very convincing at the time  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P7pOA4eeuS0&t=72m13s\n\nI also have friends who have had good success building diy tube traps \u2014 which can be pretty affordable.",

I have the 16 9\u201d tube traps and 3 13\u201d speaker stand tube traps (that probably do dip a bit lower into the bass trapping realm), then I have a 4\u2019 x 2\u2019 x 4\u201d cloud above me from ATC. Then just two wall-mounted ATC panels in the back. \n\nMy room has a bump at 85 Hz, but I have mostly learned to work around that! It\u2019s not a big issue outside of some sustained bass notes. \n\nMy setup definitely could use some more treatment, but I\u2019ve been waiting to move to a more permanent space. I also have a lot of listening time down here and mainly like the results!",

I tested the HEDDs, Airpod Max, Audeze LCD-X and own the M50s and HD650s. \n\nI was looking for the headphone that gave me the best assortment of detail, fun, space, and \u201etranslation\u201c to speakers out of the box (without extra eq or another amp to power it outside of my UAD interface). \n\nFor my taste the Focals fit that perfectly. Even hooked up to my laptop directly the sound was extremely fun, detailed and useful in making decisions. \n\nAlso the look, comfort, travel case and extra pads are a nice touch. Only negative for me was the cable being a bit too short in a recording/moving around in a studio setting. But I wouldn\u2019t use them for that anyways. \n\nAirPod Max (with noise canceling) would probably be second. They just lack the finer details and deep bass for me. \n\nThen the LCD-x (they are technically better than the Airpods but I wouldn\u2019t prefer the LCDs in a real world setting. Only in the studio with some eq added).\n\nHEDDs I so heavily disliked it wasn\u2019t even funny. The UAD Interface can\u2019t power them properly and they just sounded like a crappy and weird set of nearfield speakers playing from either side of your ear. Can\u2019t even explain it.",

    "content": "So here\u2019s the roundup on my dumb drum thing. This is a scrappy little experiment on my part to see if I can get a convincing drum sound in my little drum room. Before starting this, I had the idea in my mind that if a room is good for mixing, it must be good for recording! *Insert Game Show Buzzer* I ran into many of the things I didn\u2019t like about the Barefoot Studio B Live room \u2014 and those things were exaggerated by a factor of 10. First of all, my room is very dead by design. It treats me great in mixing, but made for a real challenge when trying to get *some* sort of drum personality. I was also working with a pretty shitty old premier kit that hadn\u2019t seen the light of day in half a decade. Shitty cymbals, very quickly tuned heads \u2014 I wasn\u2019t setting myself up for success\u2026 but whatever.\n\nThe setup was a little ridiculous (minus a few utilitarian pieces):\nKick: Beta 52 -> Scully 280\nSnare: SM57 -> Scully 280\nOH Mono: Coles 4038 -> Ampex 351 -> 1176 (not compressing, just to trim gain before \u2018tools)\nOH L/R: U67s -> UTA pre (thanks Matt!)\nKick Room: U47 -> UTA Pre (again\u2026)\n\nThis is where I ended up, without mixing, and with some quick playing and utility EQ/balancing. No compression except a limiter to bring up the level. While the actual drums themselves don\u2019t sound amazing, I really struggled with getting any sort of energy out of the drums\u2026 it all just got sucked out. \n\nHere are the results if you care (don\u2019t judge my shitty playing)\n\nI think if it do this again I would:\n1) Have a better sounding kit. Turns out, shit in.. shit out. I knew this. We all know this. But here I am.\n2) Maybe put some sheets of plywood around to create some surface in the room. Just give it some life.\n3) Not use the Scully. It\u2019s so hard to get them to not sound distorty\u2026 I just don\u2019t have enough pres on hand to have clean path for everything. Mix studio living.\n\nSo it goes\u2026",

    "content": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m new to the community - really enjoying it so far. This will be a long post asking for some studio build advice \u2014 I hope that\u2019s ok. Please just let me know if there\u2019s a better thread for this sort of thing. \n\nI\u2019d be extremely grateful for any feedback! Here\u2019s some info: \n\n- I am currently moving my home studio to this basement space that is about 400 SQ feet. Concrete floor and walls except for the front wall shown in this picture - that is drywall as it separates the rest of the basement. \n\n- The ceiling joists are exposed and are about 7.5\u201d deep. \n\n- My primary function for this room will be mixing, but I will also be doing smaller overdubs like piano and vocals. \n\nCurrently, after painting the walls and floor, my plan is as follows: \n- Stuff the ceiling joists with insulation \u2014 probably Safe N Sound\u2026 thoughts on that choice? \n\n- Cover the joists with fabric from Gilford of Maine. \n\n- Figure out how to drill into concrete \ud83d\ude02 Then put panels everywhere. Most of my panels are about 4\u201d thick and are comprised of the safe n sound insulation. \n- Put some big rugs down but also leave a bit of the concrete exposed if possible cuz I like the look. Haha \n\n- My monitoring set up is NS10M\u2019s (don\u2019t laugh) with an Avantone CLA-100 amp and a PreSonus T10 sub. I\u2019ve got an Apollo 8 Duo and Apollo Twin X Quad. \n\nThat concludes my plan so far. Am I on the right track? \ud83d\ude33 \n\nI really appreciate any feedback you\u2019re willing to give. \ud83d\ude4f",

    "content": "@cian riordan So...I decided to use the left speaker as my reference because when I shot a laser across the speaker platform, it was pretty close to level. So I marked its position on the floor, took the speakers off the stands and then replaced the spikes on the Sound Anchors with some heavier duty feet I found on Amazon. My studio is on a concrete slab so the spikes were always SUCH a pain in the ass to position. New ones have felted bottoms and are way easier to maneuver. \n\nOnce I got my new feet on each of the stands, I used my nifty new digital level to tune the stands to be exactly level by leveling out their feet. Then, I tuned the speaker platforms to be exactly level now that the stands themselves were level. This was a pain in the ass. Lot of light touch, some mallet, and lots of cursing. My Bosch laser measurer came in very handy to measure the height from the bottom of the speaker stand to the floor on either side. Makes it way easier to get them exact.",

I have a pair of old monitors laying around (tannoy reveal 5a) and want to get some sort of not very permenant way to add these to my bedframe I guess? I was looking into those monitor stands that have those clip-on/screw-on things to attach them to a desk, but those clips are all made for desks and tables, so horizontal planks. For my bedframe they would need to be angled down, since the planks are vertical. Is there any product out there or anything I could piece together to make this work?",

    "content": "Lots of great ideas here! I'm personally on the @Rollmottle train (also @cian riordan aesthetic is similarish)...I just agree aesthetically that I like the brighter/cleaner/warmer vibe. Of course your tastes may differ, but my lights dim like @montrose recording  said...it's really nice when it's getting later in the day to have some more dim lighting to match the outside a bit. \n\nAlso really love to keep things ultra simple visually...the least amout of things around (even cords, etc) but again that's just me. Different things inspire us all.\n\nAlso big fan of keeping the digital environment very organized, as few things open as I need. I still certainly can get distracted like the rest of us. One thing I underestimated about running a full time mastering shop is just the number of interactions per day that are needed...and that can definitely take you out of the flow so I tend to keep it very contained...say only respond at certain points of the day and generally I deliver all my files at the end of the day in one batch. I'm sure some similar type of thing can be achieved for us all no matter the process. Still a work in progress over here of course!\n\nMy final thought is that the best focus enabler I've found is just good old fashioned hard-nosed exercise. Getting up early, squatting heavy, hard sprints...taking things to the limit (safely) really allow me personally to retain a very real sense of resilience and focus. And increase and double-down on discipline -- which in turn increases motivation often for me!\n\nBest of luck! As far as I can tell, retaining focus in our current age is an eternally ongoing (and extremely valuable) skill to work on",

    "content": "Yup! They're very similar in that regard, but still different. You can generally think of RM as the fast version of tremolo (volume modulation), in the way that FM synthesis is the fast version of vibrato (pitch modulation). Both techniques generate side bands through modulation rates that are in the audible range (> 20 Hz).\n\nThe difference between RM and tremolo is that tremolo is a uni-polar modulation and ring modulation is bipolar, which will generate different side bands. I'm a little fuzzy on the math of it these days, but if I remember correctly RM will generate negative side bands which are reflected at 0 Hz and start to travel back up the spectrum, whereas with AM they disappear when they get to 0 Hz.\n\nPop 'em in a frequency analyzer and watch the side bands go! Especially the RM. It's pretty informative.",
