Then busted out a mirror and angled my desk to avoid any reflections from the monitors at the listening position. Shot the room again and popped this EQ on the output in UAD Console (it\u2019s finally good for something!!), and am very pleased with the new arrangement. \ud83c\udf89\n\nRuairi might have a fit with this EQ curve, but I\u2019m ABing it in and out and it\u2019s definitely helpful, until I get my act together and build some membranes!",

You can adjust the sensitivy of the analog input...  Here's a better explanation from the manual\n\n> The analog inputs of the A32 DANTE can each be set to different\n> sensitivities.

I use it sometimes so that I can overdrive the Trident and keep the channel direct outputs under the limiter's clipping stage.
