The dynamics, combined with the *type of low frequency* content of those genres at that time, along with DJ\u2019s who knew what the fuck they were doing, along with sound crews who worked the rave circuit and were continually hired and worked with the same DJ\u2019s, all contributed so much to this magic rave Vinyl era.\nThere\u2019s nothing that touched those deep kickass lows back then, But That was the style! \nSo much has changed. Producers back then got their loudness from pushing analog desks into the red, Simple Mackie desks, stuff like that. But We moved to an all digital world. I remember when the first pioneer digital DJ mixers came out, I\u2019d put a vinyl on and just be like\u2026this is shit! where\u2019s my headroom?!?! the frequency distribution of the music has also changed, DJ\u2019s also got more concerned with jumping up and down and clapping rather than mixing and gain staging. Clubs started putting limiters on the systems \nMost of these kids doing EDM at high levels-really don\u2019t even need ME\u2019s at all! Their mix busses are so super complex. If they took that stuff off, I\u2019d be totally lost. But they like a little analog processing in a lot of cases. Loudness, they *don\u2019t need*\nClipping, limiting, whatever, it\u2019s the modern thing- If i can help I can- and I tell them not to change a thing- just back off the limiter until the exact moment where the track loses the vibe. Then I go.",

    "content": "Below I am sharing something that I send to my mastering clients when they inquire about targeting LUFS levels for streaming services. I hope it is helpful to some readers. Discussion is welcome.\n\n\nRegarding mastering to streaming LUFS loudness normalization targets, i.e. -14 LUFS - I do not recommend trying to do that. I know it's discussed all over the web, but in reality very few people actually do it. To test this, try turning loudness matching off in Spotify settings, then check out the tracks listed under \"New Releases\" and see if you can find material that's not mastered to modern loudness for it's genre. You will probably find little to none. Here's why people aren't doing it:\n\n1 - In the real world, loudness normalization is not always engaged. For example, Spotify Web Player and Spotify apps integrated into third-party devices (such as speakers and TVs) do not have loudness normalization. YouTube is normalized but \"YouTube Music\" is not normalized. Apple Music's web player is not normalized. With normalization off, your -14 LUFS track will sound much softer than most other tracks.\n\n2- Even with loudness normalization turned on, many people have reported that their -14 LUFS masters sound quieter than other tracks in playlists.\n\n3 - Some streaming services have different loudness targets (Apple's is -16) and there's no guarantee they won't change their loudness targets again in the future. For example, Spotify lowered their loudness target by 3dB in 2017, then in 2021 they switched measurement from ReplayGain to LUFS. Also, in Spotify Premium app settings you find 3 different loudness settings; \"Quiet, Normal, and Loud\". Now AES is recommending that all music streaming services switch to -16 LUFS. It's a moving target. \n\n4 - Some people suggest making multiple masters at different levels. But digital aggregators (CD Baby, etc.) generally do not allow more than one version of each song, so you'd have to make separate paid submissions.",

I've recently started including 44/24's. i've always discouraged submitting anything other than 44/16 because who knows what some of these services are doing with SRC and dither, but i think with the advent of high res and lossless delivery, you are well-advised to submit the higher bit-rate files nowadays. all that said, with something like 44/24 you are probably pretty safe from getting your shit munched down-funnel.",

Even if 99% of users don't give a shit about the perfect playback, we do. That's why we have that \"lossless\" switch. We'll never switch to AAC due to bandwidth issues.\n\nThe \"constant upgrades\" are often due to the ever changing landscape of browsers. Each client is often on a different browser, different device and different internet connection. It's our job to understand that landscape and push fixes to ensure we get perfect playback across all environments. \n\nThat's part of the reason we built the iOS app, to be able to provide a more consistent playback experience when browsers themselves are the limiting factor, and so that clients can listen offline to take the network out of the equation. But I totally understand that you can't really ask a client to install another app on their iPhone. \n\nTo my knowledge, Samply is still the only platform that lets clients stream full resolution lossless AND gapless track transitions in a browser. It's a really tough engineering challenge, but ultimately the backbone of our entire business. We're committed to continuing to solve this problem and evolve with the technology available.",

A few thoughts\n\nNot everyone has loudness normalization turned on. It also doesn\u2019t exist on Smart TVs, many streaming web interfaces etc\n\nThe different services all have different level norm targets (and even different settings within just Spotify) - and they change pretty regularly\n\nIn terms of absolute level when normalization is active what matters is arrangement (dense mixes sound quieter than sparse/spacious mixes), EQ (bright/mid range forward mixes sound louder than dark) and distortion levels (clipped/distorted mixes feel perceptually louder than clean). If I make a master a dB louder in mastering using just limiting for example, they just turn it down a dB more when it\u2019s level normed.\n\nSo what does all of this mean? It means that every song has sweet spot where the EQ/tone, the arrangement and the overall clipping/limiting level works best and communicates the intent. That\u2019s what we aim for.\n\nYou can use a site like loudnesspenalty.com to see what will happen but it will just drive you crazy and the only real way to meaningfully alter the result is to change the arrangement/mix or overall EQ a lot. On release day you can find 1000 records that are louder than yours if you want to.\n\nIf being the loudest is the intent - game everything listed above and you can \u201cwin\u201d. If doing your unique thing and communicating a song and a performance is the goal then I think you are there!\"\n\n(posted with Nomographs permission)",

    "content": "A few thoughts on all this.. I agree with @Nomograph Mastering that the top of funnel for Spotify isn't bringing in enough money to overnight increase the amount music rights holders are paid. However, I am not convinced Spotify couldn't raise their subscription price in certain markets. Netflix has successfully raised their prices many times over the years. I've been paying the same price for Spotify for close to 10 years (maybe it increased a dollar at one point, but not sure).\n\nI do believe Daniel Ek and Spotify have earned some ire from the music community. Ek is a billionaire and the average Spotify employee makes close to $110k / year. You would probably need around ~1.5 million monthly listeners and ~3.5 million streams / month to earn an equivalent amount (master recording side sans publishing and no other income stream). There are maybe a little over 6000 artists that have that large of a listenership in the entire world out of conservatively 5-7 million artists on the platform.\n\nThere are many things Spotify could do to improve economic outcomes for artists / musicians. Here are a few in no particular order:\n1) Allow artists to link to their own website. Believe it or not we can't do this. Your own website is the one piece of online real estate that you actually control. On Spotify, IG, Tiktok, etc... you are playing in someone else's sandbox.\n2) Allow artists more control over their profiles and the way they are laid out. One thing that infuriates me is how Spotify sorts albums by popularity rather than release date. I would like to change that. This would be beneficial to promoting newer releases. As well all external links off of Spotify are virtually hidden on the 'about' page at the bottom of your profile making it harder for fans to follow you where you want to be followed.",

    "content": "Surely there's something to learn from the history though yes? Cutting is what the profession of mastering used to be and digital is not wholly removed. We can certainly take learnings from our history while embracing modern methods. Cutting good vinyl is also respect for the folks who work on it and the artists who want their music conveyed appropriately across mediums. \n\nI have no problem making stuff massively loud with zero limiting and small amounts of soft clipping, and still retaining tons of transient peaks. I prefer this sound to heavy limiting at the master stage where the program material audibly hits the limiter and the soundstage and sense of headroom collapses. To me, the limiter is optional, but I do understand many use it before they acquire the skills to work without it. \n\nThat said, I also was taught that in genres where its appropriate (Imagine Dragons, Hip hop, EDM, etc.) that those sounds should go in at the production or mixing stage. At the mastering stage I was taught to do no harm, and only to enhance what was present. In my work pushing more than a few dB into a limiter to affect the groove of a piece does not track with my understanding of doing as little to change the sound as possible. But of course, it all depends on the project. My clients who make very mainstream pop/youtube music don't particularly care if I radically editorialize as long as it sounds good and serves the tune. \n\nThere's also something to be said for music which needs to be quiet. Not all music should be loudenated to within an inch of its life. Not all music needs quiet and intimacy. I think of we hold the pursuit of \"the program material's individual requirements to be king\" we cannot then also dismiss vinyl as unimportant or say that one MUST always do things a particular way.",

I know Edsel you are similar -- but when I let go of the \"this is what mastering IS\" mindset, and leaned into the \"this is the box in front of me I have to operate within\", things got much better. Acceptance.\n\nIs it mastering if I only work from a stereo file? A limited REF? Tearing apart an mp3 bounce with AI and remaking it? An Ableton session? I say yes to all if we are the ones getting the record across the line. \n\nThat said, the traditional approach is IMO the best for many reasons, but in some sense just having a stereo file is an almost arbitrary restriction based on how projects are made and shared (though a good one). But as technology evolves and shifts, best to be on the cutting edge of knowing how to make a lot of situations work -- I bet the winners will be those who do",

But the client sent it to them and did all the communication so i have no idea what the process was like. Also again, many many years ago so could have been an isolated incedent. I'd rather pay a mid level guy in my town that i can easily communicate with than do an online thing like that though.  I think when we did it, we never even got to find out the name of the engineer that did it. EDIT: As Cian said, sterling is also just uploading through an online portal and dealing with assistants, but, at least you know who is mastering it. They also generally only include one revision in the per song mastering rate at sterling, so its similar that way. If you dont have a label budget, it can be limiting if its not quite right the first time back, way less flexible than going with someone who might be able to acommodate a bit more back and forth when needed.",

A few thoughts: I don't think or hope that Spotify will be gone in 5 years and if it is, that would be bad for most artists (at least in a vacuum). 66% of all the money I've made from DSPs in the past five years has been from Spotify and before this past year it was probably closer to 80% (had a track get lucky on Youtube Red and Amazon Music). I see similar distributions of earnings from pretty much every artist in my community. One thing that Spotify does better than any other DSP is music discovery and recommendation. On Spotify an independent artist with modest buzz around a release can find their track being recommended via Discover Weekly or Release Radar to thousands of new listeners sometimes over night. Spotify also has the most robust user playlist experience out there. Allowing users interoperable playlists I think is a huge boon to us music creators. W/o user playlists and Spotify's music recommendation algorithms I honestly don't know if I could have made a living in music production the past five years b/c all the artists I work with would be broke.",

This is a double-album, 21-song project that I already discounted more than I probably should have based on the amount of time i've already put into the project because of all of the unexpected needs of the client. I keep trying to accommodate the needs as best I can, because the client is so kind and this is a project he is very passionate about. The issue is that the publicist is asking for things that she isn't fully able to be very clear about (I think maybe because she is somewhat inexperienced and doesn't know what it is she actually needs), and it's starting to approach a level in which I'm providing a lot of stuff for no charge--even though at the moment, I'm swamped and starting to get a little stressed trying to squeeze other projects in and also trying to wrap this up and get the client everything he needs. For some background, I had to re-make the DDPs because the client changed some song title information after I had already done the due diligence of confirming with him that all of the information was correct. now, his publicist, who had originally requested embedded MP3s with all of the album/artist/sequence info and album art for the album and also five singles, is now saying she meant to say she needed wavs.",

Why risk a consumer product crapping out during playback and adding potential distortion and why totally disregard pretty much every DSP's recommendation that true peaks not exceed -1 for the encoding process?

I think this is a purely technical topic...my master doesn't sound any different with TP or not if you just de-clip the occasional one (and I don't make creative decisions based on it at all). Was just wondering if it could induce some sort of distortion somewhere along the line in the codecs. Using TP on a limiter is a different story.\n\nObviously very few clients will be \"checking\" this but I think it's my job to understand the trade-offs or if it matters at all when things go to streaming. Saw an IG live by Dale Becker and he seemed to imply that if there were TP in files they might get turned down more on streaming. I don't think it's a great thing to chase how masters will translate to any one platform but it's important to understand the marketplace the music is going to!",

Imagine putting a facebook retargeting pixel on your spotify profile page.\n4) Allow artists to own their own data. Related to three. Spotify For Artists analytics is a neat distraction. There could be so much more.\n5) In the OG spotify days you could direct message other Spotify users which made it way easier to reach out to playlisters and promote your music. Granted this would probably get spammy real fast.\n6) Switching from a pro rata payout model to a user centric payout model. Given how spotify calculates the royalty pool currently the greater the total number of streams on the platform the LESS an individual stream is worth. Therefore the value of a stream has been decreasing for years. In 2017 I was making closer to $0.004 / stream and now I am making closer to $0.0026.\n7) Eliminate fraudulent streams from the platform. Switching to a user-centric model would eliminate a vast amount of streaming fraud over night. Spotify currently has very little incentive to police streaming fraud. What do they care? They scrape their 30-40% off the top.\n8) Democratize editorial playlists inclusion instead of making it a major label circle jerk\n\nI could go on but this is maybe getting excessive",

    "content": "I'm nowhere near the level that most others are here...but I send both a Samply link for listening and use Dropbox for the deliverables and tell the client which is best used for which. People seem to like it and it's pretty seamless -- Samply allows an easy player and Dropbox allows easy downloads and clear file structures when needed (and allows you to switch out and add to uploads if ever needed for the same link, links don't go bad, etc). Had a project where we put up the masters and the mixing engineer bounced a wrong version of an alt (I couldn't tell this on my end due to the nature of the alt). But the link had already been sent to client. We were able to switch out the file seamlessly before the client listened via Dropbox and all was okay\n\nAnd to @Gerhard Westphalen point...if I ever fill up my very large dropbox allowance it probably means I'm rolling in dough and the cost of the extra storage is worth the overhead.",

To make it even worse, if the song you are listening to was uploaded at 48, you\u2019re getting two rounds of conversion. Down to 44 and back up to 48.\n\nSoftware engineers who can\u2019t hear the difference and value user ease of experience are happy to do this willynilly many times over if it\u2019s convenient from a software perspective. \n\nWith core audio, all applications, which run at different sample rates at the same time, all get summed to one channel in a way that I don\u2019t know or understand that math decisions behind (and I\u2019m not aware of anyone who does know the math decisions behind it, I\u2019d love to chat with anyone who does), and it is then fed to us from that channel.

Two songs ago he got onto experimenting with AI mastering which he thankfully moved off of because the tracks sounded horrible. \nThis last track we did, he had another ME offer to do a test master on it. I was down and just asked if I could hear it before it goes out. Fast forward, he uploads the track and the first time I hear about it was through socials. So I asked if he went with that ME and how it sounded and got told no, his drummer mate ended up mastering the track. \nSo I just got quite frustrated as him and I have quite an open relationship. Mainly because it didn\u2019t sound that great. There was a bunch of true peak overs which thankfully I\u2019m less stressed about after speaking to Jack\nSo I\u2019m struggling to see if this is ego or just that I don\u2019t trust this person who mastered the track.",

All that is needed to make it fit is to just gain down the master a bit (it was done in a previous era of the artist, one that was a little brighter/louder).\n\nAll the current mixes are at 48k. Previous master is at 44.1k. \n\nIs it okay to submit the project with all songs at 48k but just the one at 44.1k? Has anyone come across something similar?\n\nSeems ridiculous maybe but I'd like to avoid the upsample -- I know it's a tiny difference, if any but previous master was done by an outstanding engineer, would want to do as little changing as possible (and I love how it sounds too). I'm assuming since it gets converted when going to streaming all is fine but I can't find much info at even a distrokid about this.",

Most distros take it almost anything, though I\u2019ve seen more requests recently for 44k 16bit for some of these smaller, newer distros. \n\nApple will play it (in ALAC) at what\u2019s delivered, yeah Spotify will covert but it\u2019s making an OGG anyway (which we can check in RX) \u2014 so my preference (and I\u2019m open to have my mind changed) is to deliver what it was created and mixed at for a lot of reasons.

    "content": "Alright I'm back with another question for the hive mind:\n\nFinishing up an EP today we've been slow-dripping for awhile. First song we did had big drums, tons of low, measures louder (-8.4 LUFS). Mastered and approved before the rest of them came this way. Rest of the songs are sparse, open, beautiful. But accordingly meausre much lower (loudest is -11 LUFS). \n\nSo with the new info Dale posted the other day re: how Spotify is normalizing levels, I thought let's just turn down the louder one a little to see how it fits (it's fine), maybe that can buy us a db or whatever for the other songs when they normalize to the loudest song as long as the creative intent is preserved (it is). And that's cool. But actually a better result IMO was to just ease up on the loudness of the first song (at -8.4 LUFS), it makes more sense in the project being a bit more dynamic rather than having the dense one be pulled down.\n\nQuestion is: will this cause the single version to be replaced by the new album one when going to distro?\n\nI've had masters that we replaced before with a lowered ceiling in projects and all was fine, but the actual master was exactly the same minus the ceiling, so in a single context it would normalize the same. I know to keep exact length to ms, etc etc. \n\nBut the new info Dale posted makes me rethink how to handle this in albums (on Spotify -- on Apple is doesn't seem to be doing that?)",

About a year ago I noticed that a label I work with was submitting my non-ADM files to Apple as ADM and still getting certified. I asked the label to use the ADM files in the future as I didnt want to risk my accreditation. They responded that nothing had been flagged by distribution nor by Apple but they would do so moving forward.\n\nFlash forward to this year - I noticed that some ADM files from other engineers had overs, not just clipping but significant overs, check the newest Olivia Rodrigo album. According to the aforementioned document, definitely not to spec hahah.\n\nFlash forward from there to about a month ago, I submitted my standard formats to another label I work with including standard streaming WAV as well as an ADM file. Through chatting with their distribution team it came to light that at the distro end of things they could only upload 1 file (the ADM) and this file would be delivered to each DSP in the specs they can receive, which I found very interesting since the ADM file is occasionally different than the other streaming WAVs.",

Flac, aiff exports are all fine, 320kbps mp3 is clipping (expected due to conversion). Since I dithered my final master before export (24bit dither), can I now just gain down the track a little in rx to avoid clipping in the mp3 file? or does this mess up dither etc?

Would you have let this go out like this? How do you approach it if you get a mix like this?

    "content": "Great question. Let me try to answer. I suspect this may be where the learning opportunity lies...\n\nI think what matters to me is that 1) the piece is presented in the best way possible to maximise its impact or essence 2) the piece is listenable and that impact is not lost in a wide range of environments / contexts (i was tempted to say \"it translates well\" but I think that's a subtly different thing) 3) the client is happy with the result, and feel confident releasing their art, feeling good about it, feeling it's the best version of what it could be.\n\nI think it's point 3 that gives me pause. You can count my paying mastering clients on one hand, so I'm as \"beginner level\" as it gets, but that said, when i talk to those clients, they share with me that they want a mastering engineer to ensure that their music is going to \"sound right on streaming platforms and translate well to lots of systems\". There's a lot of FUD about loudness normalisation, LUFS, etc. I don't think it's a huge leap to feel that we should also be thinking about common playback devices such as airpods, and bluetooth speakers. For clients who aren't seasoned mixers or record makers, I wonder how they would feel if they listened to their mastered record on a bluetooth speaker and heard that whole parts had practically vanished. Of course I'm also sensitive to not wanting to introduce doubt in their minds unnecessarily.",

I switched from Amazon music partially because their desktop program wouldn't always load my library properly and the iPhone app stopped working completely (would stop playing in the car and wouldn't load my library) but my experiences with Tidal haven't been much better. The quality settings never seem to work and it constantly has problems with playback. Not playing at all either mid album or when I try to start a specific track, skipping tracks, and even weirder is if I'm listening to one album and then switch to a different one, it'll often throw in a track from the old album while acting like it's still playing the new one",

I was able to actually get in touch with someone who confirmed that both their OGG and AAC streams have gapless capability, and, more importantly, they also confirmed that gapless is simply designed to remove the silence added by the encoding process and will not touch anything in the original master. So at least timing wise, listening to an album with gapless playback enabled should exactly match the master.",

One of these I am remastering and two we are using masters I previously did.  The artist wants to upload the remaster with the same ISRC  to keep the play count in Spotify. \nHe says the new file must be exactly the same length as the old master. Is this the case?\nThe problem being that the single versions of the three tracks don\u2019t have a gap burned at the end to get the track spacing right and I would prefer the track spacing from the CD to be the same on streaming rather than jumping straight in. \nAnyone got any intel or solved this in anyway?",

It's no problem on their end because they just used the file I'd rendered and uploaded to Samply. But now I have a clip in my montage that doesn't match the released version, which I don't like. I ended up dropping the master on a reference track instead.\n\nI think this issue was partially caused because I tend to send an initial rough master too early in the process and they get demo-itis. For some reason I've always wanted to send clients an initial rough master after I've done the quick \"from the gut\" broad strokes, but before I've totally nailed down the nitty gritty stuff, to see if they like the direction I'm headed. And all too often they end up liking the first version.\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking v2 and making it worse on a regular basis? I dunno... \ud83d\ude02",

In my experience the label\u2019s PR team is still very important in playlisting and if the remaster gets a new push from a new label that might help a lot.  \n\nif they do a smart repackaging as a deluxe remastered album, maybe add a live version or bonus track, this might help too. They will definitely get another push in the Spotify Release Radar which is a good source of new streams.",

    "content": "Hey there. The only way it would work is if it's an all new release, with new ISRC and UPC and everything.. but even then Spotify may see that it's a previously released track for this artist and not allow it for Playlist submissions. If you share the same metadata, track lengths, etc etc.. if it all looks the same, it will likely not be available to that artist for play listing at all.\n\nSo PR, MGMT, Label relationships with Apple, Spotify, etc would be the best fail proof approach I think there. Of if they get a distro deal like with Tone Tree or Symphonic who can help bring new life to the release.\n\nJust leaning on the algos and stuff won't do it in this case, I really thing a human working the release relationally is what it would take.",

I wonder why the releases of such big artists would have such issues\n\n- Kali Uchis - Moonlight: It's very harsh in the top end and unbearable. Why was the mastering engineer unaware of that ?\n\n- Ava Max - Kings & Queens: Distortion at the beginning of the track, is it intentional for the loudness of the track, or is it accidental due to streaming platforms ? (i checked on both youtube & spotify)\n\nI'm not trying to bash anyone, i am just curious about them and dont want to make such problems happen",

A year or so ago after chatting about this very same thing I submitted a couple of test albums for gapless playback tests to Distrokid, the idea being that onece they were on streaming we could do verified tests over how gapless works in different situations.  Unfortunately the masters kept getting rejected by the DSP.  I need to try again and add some musical content in there to fool the bots, but I lost a couple of days going down that rabbit hole.",
