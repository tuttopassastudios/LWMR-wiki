    "content": "Been trying to think of a way in to the question about what I did without being completely frustrating or giving a list of moves that don't mean anything outside of the context of being in my chair, hearing what and how I hear.\n\nThis process for this song is like any other...listen for what the song needs and act accordingly. That's the frustrating answer but it's also true. What did you do? \"I mastered it.\" lol\n\nBut I know that's not what you're asking. For a track like this, I'm primarily focused on the vocal and how it's sitting and feeling. The vocal performance is incredibly dynamic and intimate. This one had some ringy stuff through 2.5k and in the upper mid range that I felt was detracting from the \"fireside\" intimacy. The goal was to take off some of the edge without stepping on the presence. That was a combo of RX and EQ. \n\nOn this song, I did an analog pass because I am usually able to manage to get the balance of presence and de-edge I'm looking for very quickly. Since time was of the essence here, that was the move. Couple of moves on Equilibrium digitally before the Gyraf and Porter Grinder in the analog chain. The \"trickiest\" thing I did here was flip the Porter Grinder into M/S to bring the vocal closer into the center (by cutting!) and to push the mellotron and atmospherics to the sides (by boosting). All very subtle stuff.\n\nSo, there were some moves here, but the moves were all in service of the feeling the song was telling me it needed. We talk a lot about monitoring here. When you can connect to the song and walk around inside of it, it's much easier to know what you need to do (or not to do) to bring it to life.",

I've recently started including 44/24's. i've always discouraged submitting anything other than 44/16 because who knows what some of these services are doing with SRC and dither, but i think with the advent of high res and lossless delivery, you are well-advised to submit the higher bit-rate files nowadays. all that said, with something like 44/24 you are probably pretty safe from getting your shit munched down-funnel.",

We finished the record and had it mastered by Brian Gardener and Eric wasn't super happy -- we had just found out that Howie moved to town and was up at Steven Slate's place so we paid a visit. Eric asked if he'd take a swing a song and he just absolutely crushed it. So we gave him the album and what we got back was hilarious: totally mismatched levels from song to song, some L&R balances totally off whack. Eric ended up going to his studio to figure out what the hell was going on and found all of his shit just wildly out of calibration (he was mastering from 1/2\"). Ended up getting it across the line... the album sounded great, but the experience was... an experience. That being said, super fond memories and he's a lovely guy.",

The idea that there's a dramatic sonic difference between any reasonably spec'd modern converter is just insane to me. I've gone down the rabbit hole for years with comparative listening with converters, clocks, etc and I've built my own conclusions --  I hope everyone here has a chance to do that as well instead of just taking people's word on the internet for how many thousands of dollars people should spend on boutique A/D/A.",

RX sees this as a surround file and I can do the edits to all files at once. I'm usually just monitoring the main mix.

I'll be brief but after a near decade of being a jack of all trades one serious mastering project was all it took for me to realize it is where my greatest strengths lie and where I have the most value to my peers. It was like a moment of me realizing that it is what people would like me to do, and that made it feel all the more right in the moment. 6 odd years later and I really couldn't imagine trying to do all the roles or even two well. Niching down was a requirement to leveling up, for me at the time. \n\nI'd wager the fact that you're even thinking about this is a good sign that your give-a-fuck meter is at a high enough level to warrant niching down. Also I know for a fact you crush !!\n\nbig hell ya for being clear about your strenghts and role ! I think niching down is a path to leveling up if done at the right time in ones personal journey.",

    "content": "On that note, can't remember where I found this but a related piano recipe from Michael Brauer. Hoping he hasn't trademarked this one so the Discord doesn't get shut down.\n\n\n\n\"Remember the early Elton John records? Remember how his piano shimmered? At mediasound we loved that sound so a lot of us were always playing around with getting different versions of it. No lacquered hammers, no Dolby A off, just a combination of compression and EQ.\n\n\nI only recorded Luther's voice, may he rest in peace, on that song along with \"searching\" and then mixed both. Luther was on a whole other level of singers. He walked into that session and listened to the song in the control room once, then he walked out into the studio with the lyric sheet in his hand. What you hear on\"Glow of Love\" and \"searching\" is his first fun down reading the lyrics from a yellow pad. No punches.\n\n\nThe piano sound you\u2019re referring to is probably the same one that I did for Vandross on the \u201cNever too much\u201d song.\n\n\nOk, this is how you do it.\n\n1. First insert an LA3A or LA2A (depending on the version of sound you\u2019re going after) across the stereo piano tracks. The LA2A is good if the song is slow and the chords are quarter notes. The LA3A is good if the chords are faster with a harder attack like in \u201cnever too much\u201d. Bang those meters and \n2. out of the compressor go into a couple of pultecs and push up..way up the 3 or 5 k on the low end and the 8 or 10 k on the high end. Don\u2019t be safe. \n3. Now go to the desk EQ and start clearing out some of the muddiness and EQ up the remaining mids so that it just shimmers like a baby. \n4. When it\u2019s done right, you can hear the harmonics riding up during each sustain.  \n5. I remember hearing that song on the radio and man that piano was making me feel good all over. Sounds pretty simple when you know how to do it right?\u201d",

This gets trickier with dynamics processing but that\u2019s a simple offset of the processed mix. That\u2019s all happening on the object in my DAW without need for additional plugins or routing. Since I am rarely compressing anyways, this is a low friction way of judging the moves against the mix. \n\nWhen I\u2019m happy with that, I\u2019ll print the pre-lim and then load it up on another track to do the limiting. When I\u2019m happy with the limiting, I have a quick action to create an A/B track where I can load the hot mix or mix to see if I\u2019m as loud or louder than it. \n\nNone of this is by number or meter.

The approaches and mindset I'm using, if you have access to the mix...makes them irrelevant IMO. I'm also sorta opinionated on this though. Like...why worry about making a tiny .3 db cut with .7 Q to clear up the vocal range....when you could just cut the actual elements that are the problem...or just raise the vocal?\n\nAnd almost certainly your monitoring won't let you hear these tiny moves enough to even learn probably. But I suppose there is some value is understanding the subtle balance shifts.\n\nFor me, many people can \"master\" their own track just fine for where they are at. It's not helpful at all for them to learn what a pro mastering engineer is doing day-to-day if they ever are only going to be \"mastering\" their mix. Why? It's like saying it's useful to learn the trumpet if you're ever only going to play piano IMO. Sure, it's still music but almost no skills will actually translate across. \n\nYou can always fix it better on an individual track than on the stereo file.\n\nI also sorta bristle at the what is \"mastering\" convo...we just finish records. That's it. Whatever it takes. Of course there are some broad approaches that will be applicable to everyone, but most of them would be better forgotten by mixers so they can make bolder and more creative moves.\n\nAgain, this is all just in my opinion, perhaps Ruairi is rubbing off on me lol?

Like with anything, there is not a simply quantifiable reason for why some modes work and others don't, changing from song to song. Listen carefully and use your ears. \n\nI like to use Standard Clip for highly transient material, clipping off those really high peaks to take some of the work off of the proceeding limiter. But it is very easy to get audible clipping and distortions if you go too far (if that not is not your desired result), so keep an ear out! The meter doesn't help you with that, even if it doesn't *look* like you're clipping very much.",

Very much...listen and wait until I feel the pull to do something. And if not, I just don't. But even then, I do wild stuff because my heart likes it.

    "content": "So, in most cases, you can go over 0 dB in your DAW if you're working in 32-bit (or higher) precision, and you won\u2019t necessarily hear the clipping. This is because the internal audio engine can handle peaks above 0 without immediate distortion\u2014it\u2019s all about floating-point processing magic.\n\nNow, whether the audio gets normalized to stay under 0 dB depends on what happens during export. Sometimes, what you're seeing in the DAW or Ozone meters isn\u2019t exactly what ends up in the final file\u2014especially if there's a limiter, normalization, or post-processing involved. It\u2019s even possible that the version you\u2019re analyzing wasn\u2019t actually the one that was officially released. Happens more often than you\u2019d think!\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not unusual to see mixes or masters that are technically clipping more so going over 0... in tools like Ozone or the DAW but sound fine due to the flexibility of floating-point processing. I\u2019m not saying this is a best practice\u2014but I\u2019ve definitely played around with it. I\u2019ve even intentionally clipped files way past 0 dB, re-exported them, and compared them to cleaner versions. They sounded different, but at that point, I found myself asking, \u201cWhy am I trying to squeeze one more dB of loudness out of something that\u2019s already crushed and competitive?\u201d Classic overthinking, right?\n\nAnyway, back to your question: I think what you\u2019re seeing is a product of the DAW working internally at 32- or 64-bit, so it can handle those overs without clipping during processing. Then, during export, maybe they normalized it, maybe they fixed it later, maybe it did just didn't sound distroted haha... or maybe that\u2019s just not the real released version at all. Who knows?  I would not lose sleep over it and also know what you have seen is not a \"secret\" that your missing haha.",

I\u2019m generally happy with the results/loudness I get and comfortable with the parameters, except I never really mess with the \u201ccharacter\u201d which I suppose is the speed/release of the limiting? \n\nOn a recent mix I slowed it down more than I ever would, which really just means making it slower at all from the defaul setting, I usually stick very close to it, and I really like how it made the pocket of my mix feel. But I guess, I have always understood people to use very fast release compression on masterbusses.. \n\ndo you all find yourselves moving the character/release of the final limiter around pretty widely to get the right feel or are you typically keeping it quite fast?",

    "content": "I think time spent de-essing vocals and treating HF content in vinyl prepped masters overrides worrying about how much limiting there is in my opinion. The amount of limiting and how good/bad the cut is really pertinent on the program material itself.  Not the actual amount of gain reduction you are doing because the cutter will literally just turn everything down anywhere between 8-10dB before the signal hits the amps. Excessive sibilance, on a hyper compressed rock record with insane splashy over compressed cymbals and out of control HF information will result in the dull cuts you get back from most plants where you don\u2019t have access to the cutting engineer.  They do this because they want to create a playback safe record and avoid a very expensive $10k mistake like blowing a cutterhead if their amp breakers aren\u2019t calibrated right.  Instead of spot de-essing problem on one song or spot treating problem songs on a side, they will opt for broad stroke moves (HF limiting, EQ, global de-essing) and that can be a bit of death sentence to the quality of the cut and put everyone off vinyl as a format.  Which I think is an incredible format with well crafted engineering.  Also I strongly believe that every record doesn\u2019t belong on vinyl\u2026but that\u2019s another convo.",

    "content": "This is true (at least as I understand it) but I think the deeper discussion revolves around how dense you want the music to be, how the transients sit relative to other aspects of the music, how much low end you want and what you\u2019re willing to trade off in terms of openness/dynamics vs energy. \n\nThis is a super deep topic that I\u2019m still wrapping my head around and forming my own opinion\u2026and while I know I argued earlier it\u2019s important to consider your loudness, it should absolutely take a back seat to your feel for the music creatively IMO.\n\nThere are many complex reasons why people like things loud (some I agree with, some not) but they do and will continue to as far as I can see.\n\nSomething like LUFS I find is best rendered as background knowledge. For example I found it interesting Ruairi says he knows how loud a record is because he knows his room so well and doesn\u2019t need to look at the meters. I\u2019m still getting there but I feel that\u2019s a best case scenario so the meters aren\u2019t dictating feel",

But I\u2019ve had it happen quite a few times where I have a close relationship with a mixer and thought it could be an oversight for reasons specific to each instance (not just generally seeing a peak of 0)\u2014 turns out when the non-lim 32 bit print is sent there are sure enough overs in there.\n\nTypically i see it happen when they are going into limiters hot in the REF, obviously when they print non-lim there are overs. Talking big overs, +4db or whatever\n\nBUT \u2014 honestly it doesn\u2019t really sound \u201cclipped\u201d in the 24bit non-lim print \u2014 I\u2019m assuming the overs are just recalibrated to zero but somehow this doesn\u2019t sound bad? Of course, if I get the 32bit I find I can make it sound just as loud but \u201cbetter\u201d with the full waveform represented in the 32bit file.\n\nIt\u2019s an easy fix \u2014 just get a 32 bit print without a limiter (if I can get in touch with who is handling that, which isn\u2019t always the case).\n\nI think (?) I understand what\u2019s happening \u2014 DAWs operate at 64 or 32 and can handle the overs fine in the session, but upon render at 24bit they get chopped (not sure about wording).\n\nTotally fine \u2014 I can and have handled it no problem, just a curiosity on what others are seeing, if I\u2019m even on the mark about this and how (or if) you are handling it.",

Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively). a dB or two of clipping will help the limiter work less.\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",
