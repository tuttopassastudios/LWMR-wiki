    "content": "Been trying to think of a way in to the question about what I did without being completely frustrating or giving a list of moves that don't mean anything outside of the context of being in my chair, hearing what and how I hear.\n\nThis process for this song is like any other...listen for what the song needs and act accordingly. That's the frustrating answer but it's also true. What did you do? \"I mastered it.\" lol\n\nBut I know that's not what you're asking. For a track like this, I'm primarily focused on the vocal and how it's sitting and feeling. The vocal performance is incredibly dynamic and intimate. This one had some ringy stuff through 2.5k and in the upper mid range that I felt was detracting from the \"fireside\" intimacy. The goal was to take off some of the edge without stepping on the presence. That was a combo of RX and EQ. \n\nOn this song, I did an analog pass because I am usually able to manage to get the balance of presence and de-edge I'm looking for very quickly. Since time was of the essence here, that was the move. Couple of moves on Equilibrium digitally before the Gyraf and Porter Grinder in the analog chain. The \"trickiest\" thing I did here was flip the Porter Grinder into M/S to bring the vocal closer into the center (by cutting!) and to push the mellotron and atmospherics to the sides (by boosting). All very subtle stuff.\n\nSo, there were some moves here, but the moves were all in service of the feeling the song was telling me it needed. We talk a lot about monitoring here. When you can connect to the song and walk around inside of it, it's much easier to know what you need to do (or not to do) to bring it to life.",

Stereo rules\u2026and it\u2019s withstood all the changes this industry has seen because it\u2019s FREE when Alan Blumlien's patent ran out and everyone eventually adopted it\u2026it was not proprietary\u2026and asking the consumer to add one speaker was not a huge ask. \u00a0Whereas now, with Atmos\u2026I dunno\u2026it\u2019s depressing.  It's riddled with problems including their horrible horrible binaural algorithm which will continue to change and possibly improve while the engineers that make the records will have absolutely no say in said changes. \u00a0I think I wouldn't have had a problem with Atmos if they didn't force the binaural format because it takes the craft out of the medium and you end up spending half the time trying to remotely match the stereo version.  People are making money off of it, but it\u2019s just NOT the artist. \u00a0I haven\u2019t met a single artist that was actually excited about Atmos. \u00a0Like truly excited about it.",

I typically reduce the limiting amount around 2dB, sometimes more sometimes less. I\u2019ll also re balance clipper and limiter relationships\n\n2) Don\u2019t do any pre-emptive processing with the exceptions perhaps of paying a little extra care if it\u2019s a project with heavy sibilance. Don\u2019t mono the bass, don\u2019t change the EQ etc \n\n3) Make a single WAV file of each side, and a set of timing notes that show where each track starts and the length so the cutting engineer can place the track banding / markers\n\n4) I like to highlight anomalies that may present a challenge for cutter but it\u2019s not necessary",

Hair-on-fire panics about digital deadlines seem especially fake in many cases, since delivery can be so instantaneous.

It was developed with Helmut Erler who was at Dubplates for many years\u2026really amazing dude and friend of mine. \u00a0He's cut some really important techno records. \u00a0I think the visualization of the cutter head and the grooves will start to make sense to a lot of people that are a bit in the dark about cutting and modulation and how program material can really affect how things sound ultimately\u2026also how you process your master esp when it goes to plants that do in house cuts that are a bit on the safe/boring side. \u00a0You can get ahead and provide a master that counteracts some of the wide processing moves they make to avoid distortion at all cost.  Also send your client a ref of what your cut could sound esp when people push back on super long programs that don't translate well https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-simulathe-ref/",

The dynamics, combined with the *type of low frequency* content of those genres at that time, along with DJ\u2019s who knew what the fuck they were doing, along with sound crews who worked the rave circuit and were continually hired and worked with the same DJ\u2019s, all contributed so much to this magic rave Vinyl era.\nThere\u2019s nothing that touched those deep kickass lows back then, But That was the style! \nSo much has changed. Producers back then got their loudness from pushing analog desks into the red, Simple Mackie desks, stuff like that. But We moved to an all digital world. I remember when the first pioneer digital DJ mixers came out, I\u2019d put a vinyl on and just be like\u2026this is shit! where\u2019s my headroom?!?! the frequency distribution of the music has also changed, DJ\u2019s also got more concerned with jumping up and down and clapping rather than mixing and gain staging.

If they took that stuff off, I\u2019d be totally lost. But they like a little analog processing in a lot of cases.

    "content": "Just to clarify some terms for all the lurkers and for future reference...\n\nThe cutting engineer uses a lathe to make cuts. When you're making a record, you usually cut to an acetate first (aka \"dubplate\") to see how the cut fares. Acetates have a short life span and aren't entirely representative of the final product, but directionally enough to adjust as needed without using the more expensive material when you cut the actual master. Back in the vinyl days and up through even the early 2000s, DJ's were known to cut acetates to get their latest shit on something vinyl adjacent so it could be played in a set. Once an acetate is signed off on, the cutting engineer usually then cuts to a lacquer. The lacquer is what is sent off to plating and from there a father then a mother stamper is created and what is used to press your vinyl. A cutting engineer can also cut directly to a metal plate instead of a lacquer (DMM), which avoids the lacquer to father steps because the mother can be made from the DMM, but I'm not as familiar with this process.",

    "content": "Reasons for Distortion in vinyl, to answer the question - @Zack Hames. There is literally an opportunity at every stage along the way for this to happen.. and so often finger pointing starts happening really fast in the line of production. It is very complex and every time something like this pops up, hopefully the Project Manager has been keeping tabs along the way and can pin point exactly when it arose.\n\n1. Lacquer cut too loud across the board.\n\n2. Lacquer cut too loud, but sounds fine on the outer edges, but as the needle moves to the middle/center, Inner Groove Distortion is introduced with the loss of resolution/IPS in playback. i.e. the outer grooves of a vinyl move about 20x faster under the needle than the inner grooves. Thus a loss in IPS toward the center - higher chance for distortion. That is historically why we put Bangers and Loud Tracks at the top/outside of a side and ballads or quieter songs on the inside of a side. That being said, can be avoided if just cut say, another 1db quieter. \n\n3. Issues with the stamper transfer/electro plating - dirty/contaminated baths.\n\n4. Mishandling of the stampers at the record factory - not cleaned properly, dust is introduced.\n\n5. Vinyl compound not heated to the right temperature at the extruder. \n\n6. Vinyl compound contaminated.\n\n7. Too much regrind/recycled compound was incorporated into the raw vinyl compound.\n\n8. Too much cooling was added to the record during the cooling cycle of the pressing process, so the record TEARS away from the stamper, often called \"stitching\" which also leads to distortion and pops. \n\n9. Mishandling at Packaging. \n\n10. The wind changed directions.\n\nThe list goes on and on. - Not to mention user/playback error. \n\nAs @Nomograph Mastering it's a miracle it even works at all.

Some lathes have automation and it can all be done automatically, but more often times than not, it's still manual. The cutting engineer is watching the cutting time and doing it by hand.",

    "content": "Yeah. I immediately change the frequency graph to *Log* or *Extended Log*. This allows me to see the low-end and midrange with more resolution. It's the same reason most EQ graphs keep the octaves evenly spaced so that 50% of your freq graph isn't 10kHz and up. It gives you more resolution for the notes in the lower octaves.\n\nAs for FFT size or window shape, I never change it, but as Ruairi alluded to it requires an understanding of the physical limitations of FFT's. \n\nIn short if you want very fine frequency information displayed you can change the window size and lose rhythmic information. But it you want very precise rhythmic visualization you have to sacrifice how much frequency information the FFT can display. So the ideal setting ultimately depends on what problem you're trying to solve.",

Yanking the limiter off a hot pop master might change things too much, for example.\n\nAdditionally, whoever is cutting the lacquer, will likely be doing their own adjustments as they see fit.. so if you are concerned about it translating properly, I would get with a lacquer engineer that you know and trust so you can have a dialogue about it, if needed.\n\nThat being said, in my experience, great sounding projects/masters will sound good on vinyl if the cutting engineer knows what they are doing\u2026 no matter how much you try to help with the PreMaster.",

Kendrick for example never heard his productions, mixes or masters without it. Clipping has an energy in the kicks and snares that was built a certain way, limiting has rounding and smoothing characteristics and often \"holds\" the track in a particular way. You can't just bypass one , or the other or both without huge changes in groove, balance, tone and feel. (Swapping limiters for something *safer* can be equally damaging) \n\nWhat does clipping actually do? It creates square waves at the extreme (for the duration of the clipping)\n\nWhat is a square wave? It is a fundamental with a bunch of odd harmonics trailing off in level\n\nWhat happens when you low pass the square wave at the converter reconstruction filter, lathe low pass etc? It is no longer a square wave\n\nDoes cutting this no longer square wave to a disc for brief periods present challenges and cause extra momentary distortion? Yes\n\nIs that trade off worth while? I believe so and have itterated on this belief across hundreds and hundreds of projects cut and pressed to vinyl and then compared carefully with the original digital files",

It should be mentioned also that the cutting engineer will also have their own cutting mastering chain of various outboard units that are going to try and catch some of those \"issues\" that might be presented. Best practice, and others might disagree with me, in my house is to prepare the vinyl sides and a PQ sheet, QC the export, and ship it. Don't fuck with an approved master/project too much. - Partner with a great lacquer engineer, and the Master will be dope.",

Some cheaper plants dont even bother QCing which is generally frowned upon. \n\nThose 2 (for a single 33 LP) ADM files Elaine mentioned are generally all that's needed with the limiter turned off. Otherwise process as you normally would (de-clicking if you love your cutting guys) \n\nIn terms of getting a great sounding cut thats a more arcane and complex art and theres only a handful of dudes who cut the very best sounding stuff. @mcsnare is way deep in that world and may be able to comment more.

I get that the Bob Katzs and Ian Shepherds dominate the tenor of the online conversation but their effect on popular music is the inverse.\n\nRe 1. Masterer same as cutter - they are not gonna be coming here for advice and we don't need to teach them anything\n\nRe 2. Digital and cutting engineer working together happens sometimes but is often out of our control. Again in the real world the vinyl deadline is always the most pressing, and there is no way artists or labels will listen to the files prepared for cutting or understand the tradeoffs - that's why they pay us the medium bucks. I have had several great relationships with cutitng engineers over the years, and will always use my guy if I can. But often it's a black box and I won't even get test pressings.\n\nWhy make a vinyl? Becuase it's one of the only ways artists can sustain these days, becuase it's a wonderful artifact and because it's romantic.\n\nRe your \"don't care about the cut's sound\" comment ... we can do better than that level of conversation here. I've shipped a set of vinyl Masters every day this week, two today. have a second set of test pressings arriving today for a project with issues. This shit is serious as heart attack for me",

When working hybrid, I try to keep the same settings for a whole album and do eq, de-essing and level automation pre analog if needed (on individual tracks). On some albums, for me, there is no way around tweaking analog settings per track, but I try to avoid it. When printing the album I use the print-time to casually listen to the album from start to finish to catch stuff I would like to adjust (one track lacks impact ect.). Final limiter is always post analog print and I do not print hot. This makes revisions a breeze 97% of the time, unless there is a new mix of course. Also easy to back of a limiter without reprinting if the client wants more dynamics or I want a more dynamic vinyl pre-master. Hope that made sense.",

    "content": "Surely there's something to learn from the history though yes? Cutting is what the profession of mastering used to be and digital is not wholly removed. We can certainly take learnings from our history while embracing modern methods. Cutting good vinyl is also respect for the folks who work on it and the artists who want their music conveyed appropriately across mediums. \n\nI have no problem making stuff massively loud with zero limiting and small amounts of soft clipping, and still retaining tons of transient peaks. I prefer this sound to heavy limiting at the master stage where the program material audibly hits the limiter and the soundstage and sense of headroom collapses. To me, the limiter is optional, but I do understand many use it before they acquire the skills to work without it. \n\nThat said, I also was taught that in genres where its appropriate (Imagine Dragons, Hip hop, EDM, etc.) that those sounds should go in at the production or mixing stage. At the mastering stage I was taught to do no harm, and only to enhance what was present. In my work pushing more than a few dB into a limiter to affect the groove of a piece does not track with my understanding of doing as little to change the sound as possible. But of course, it all depends on the project. My clients who make very mainstream pop/youtube music don't particularly care if I radically editorialize as long as it sounds good and serves the tune. \n\nThere's also something to be said for music which needs to be quiet. Not all music should be loudenated to within an inch of its life. Not all music needs quiet and intimacy. I think of we hold the pursuit of \"the program material's individual requirements to be king\" we cannot then also dismiss vinyl as unimportant or say that one MUST always do things a particular way.",

I know Edsel you are similar -- but when I let go of the \"this is what mastering IS\" mindset, and leaned into the \"this is the box in front of me I have to operate within\", things got much better. Acceptance.\n\nIs it mastering if I only work from a stereo file? A limited REF? Tearing apart an mp3 bounce with AI and remaking it? An Ableton session? I say yes to all if we are the ones getting the record across the line. \n\nThat said, the traditional approach is IMO the best for many reasons, but in some sense just having a stereo file is an almost arbitrary restriction based on how projects are made and shared (though a good one). But as technology evolves and shifts, best to be on the cutting edge of knowing how to make a lot of situations work -- I bet the winners will be those who do",

    "content": "I think time spent de-essing vocals and treating HF content in vinyl prepped masters overrides worrying about how much limiting there is in my opinion. The amount of limiting and how good/bad the cut is really pertinent on the program material itself.  Not the actual amount of gain reduction you are doing because the cutter will literally just turn everything down anywhere between 8-10dB before the signal hits the amps. Excessive sibilance, on a hyper compressed rock record with insane splashy over compressed cymbals and out of control HF information will result in the dull cuts you get back from most plants where you don\u2019t have access to the cutting engineer.  They do this because they want to create a playback safe record and avoid a very expensive $10k mistake like blowing a cutterhead if their amp breakers aren\u2019t calibrated right.  Instead of spot de-essing problem on one song or spot treating problem songs on a side, they will opt for broad stroke moves (HF limiting, EQ, global de-essing) and that can be a bit of death sentence to the quality of the cut and put everyone off vinyl as a format.  Which I think is an incredible format with well crafted engineering.  Also I strongly believe that every record doesn\u2019t belong on vinyl\u2026but that\u2019s another convo.",

The issue is that the publicist is asking for things that she isn't fully able to be very clear about (I think maybe because she is somewhat inexperienced and doesn't know what it is she actually needs), and it's starting to approach a level in which I'm providing a lot of stuff for no charge--even though at the moment, I'm swamped and starting to get a little stressed trying to squeeze other projects in and also trying to wrap this up and get the client everything he needs. For some background, I had to re-make the DDPs because the client changed some song title information after I had already done the due diligence of confirming with him that all of the information was correct. now, his publicist, who had originally requested embedded MP3s with all of the album/artist/sequence info and album art for the album and also five singles, is now saying she meant to say she needed wavs.",

    "content": "My Reaper workflow is to use the DDP marker formatting for every format's renders. (DDP, .wav, .mp3, even vinyl, etc...) \n\nLet's say you have your track markers formatted as : **#TITLE=songtitle|PERFORMER=artist|ISRC=666** etc., aside of the \"!\" marker at the beginning for the 2sec gap and the last \"@\" marker for the album metadata.\nYour session is now ready for a DDP export.\nThen, if you want to render .mp3 and/or .wav you have to use the wildcard : **$marker(#TITLE)[|]** in the file name entry, aside to other wildcards you'll need for folder structures etc. Also, the options :  \"Bounds : All project markers\" and \"do not render files that are likely silent\" are needed and will prevent rendering the empty first 2 sec marker.\nTo automatically include metadata in the files, you can use the same wildcards such as : **$marker(#TITLE)[|]** for Title,** $marker(PERFORMER)[|]** for Artist, **$marker(ISRC)[|]** for ISRC, etc etc...\n\nWith this method, you can, with one single workflow, render : DDPs, digital formats, and even vinyl, using additional regions. Once you have everything ready in render presets, it's super easy.\nI recommend using the \"WyattRice DDP editor\" to easily edit the markers.\nI've also made a script to automatically generate a .html \"PQ sheet\" file with timings, titles, ISRCs, etc, (both CD and Vinyl)\n\nI hope it can help, English is not my native language, so feel free to ask for clarifications if needed.",

    "content": "What @hyanrarvey and others said...but usually this is used to get a bounce with the compression to make sure it is releasing in time with the groove. In gridded stuff like hip-hop you can actually be really mathematic with it, but generally you don't need to it's about the feel. Of course every compressor is different even with the same \"settings\"...you can set the attack to let enough transient in and the release to basically make the compressor return to \"zero\" in time with the movement of the groove. But the release shape, etc will definitely play a role in this too\n\nAt least this is how I'm usually using it (though very rarely compressing at all, and when I do I'm using the Weiss DS1-Mk3 plug which has complicated release characteristics). Feel free to correct me if I'm off the mark on this! It is about feel and making the record pump in a pleasing way which can add energy. But of course it's helpful to be very specific about what part of the groove you're actually wanting to bring out (or back) so to me it's hugely about your gut reaction to how the groove moves you",

If anyone is using Simulathe I would love to get your feedback on it.  I know @hebakadry and @Bonati12461 mentioned it but I think you were using it in conjunction with your actual lathes.",

Later tho reading that I could have tried a little additive move in the harmonics for that instrument lower down (if it wasn\u2019t adjacent to another important instrument down there , which in this case it wasn\u2019t ) \u2026..obvs in mixing and production the idea that cutting low makes something seem brighter \u2026.and vice versa \u2026. Is a common idea , but in mastering and looking for a solution to a problem with a particular instrument , elsewhere in the spectrum for that same instrument \u2026..on a master \u2026.I hadn\u2019t thought like that before .

    "content": "Hey folks! I always read and learn from the great stuff you share around here, and I thought it'd be cool to share something out of the ordinary that I did today for this particular situation. I was tasked with mastering a r&b/pop song with a kick and 808 really upfront, but they weren't cutting through or punching in the low/mids due to lack of EQ on the kick and saturation on the 808. (And no time to make corrections!)\n\nTo fill in what was missing, I tried a few things, but what worked best for me to address both issues was sending it to a parallel devil-loc (which is killer for adding low-mids and saturation), and using the Ozone imager to make it only sound from 500Hz downwards and make it mono. Luckily, they sent me the music and the lead vocals separately, so I was able to do this without compromising the vocal color. For this particular situation, it worked beautifully. Cheers!",

Is one way or the other better? There shouldn't be anything inherently different about cutting to metal vs. lacquer that would preclude cutting an acetate, right?",

    "content": "Yeah last time I talked to Scott Hull, he basically told me \"just make it sound good\". There are of course lots of nitty gritty things to get the most out of a record, but the cutting engineer can worry about that, any Kentucky windage on your part will probably just make it sound worse. \n\nFwiw, he also mentioned that for every dB of limiting you can expect a dB or more lower on the cut, so that noise floor will start to get annoying. They can actually cut the unlimited stuff quite a bit louder, so unless you need that limiter for the sound, maybe consider ditching it or at least hitting it less.",

The digital mastering engineer is the same as the cutting engineer. Artists were not bypassed in getting the vinyl cut approved. They listened to and signed off on both. \n\n2. The digital and cutting engineer were working closely together. \n\nNow, a lot of these artists were not making music that required massive amounts of limiting to sound the way they do. \n\nThat said, I disagree. Vinyl is already changing the sound so radically that if sonic faithfulness to the digital master is required - why make vinyl? A record will NEVER sound like the digital original or even the tape master for that matter. No two lathes sound anything alike, and the differences can be astonishing. I have heard a lathe amp turn a wretched sounding track into a brilliant one. And vice versa. Vinyl is an unfaithful medium. If you don't care about the cut's sound that's fine. Submit whatever is submitted for the digital master and let the pressing house sort it out. Why even bother with a proper 3rd party cutting engineer at that point?",

A good friend of mine is one of the top Lathe techs in North America, and my understanding from him and the cutting engineers I know and have worked with, is that digital clipping can make life hard for lathes. I'm not saying you cannot do it or arguing the merits of digital limiting or anything like that, that's an entirely separate topic. It is however a technical fact that lathes do not get along well with digital clipping and it will make the cutting engineers job harder and generally result in a record which does not sound as dynamic. If that is an acceptable compromise then so be it. As you say, if the artist/client is happy and the bills are paid, then all is well (mostly \ud83d\ude09)",

I'm not sure if it needs to be but I'm curious what the advantage would be in not having it at the end? You could always export a mock DDP though and re-import to see if the metadata holds. Better yet, import it into a different DDP playing software just in case\n\n2) for # title, I don't think making a region with the title for the sake of rendering wildcards will affect the DDP; I think the DDP metadata only looks at markers. Again, I would make a DDP and reimport it to check...\n\n...but setting a title is a surprisingly easy script, depending on your naming convention. For example, I usually name my session files to be [date] [project].RPP. So it would look like \"20250902 Example.RPP\". I have a little script that automatically sets the Title metadata in the Project Settings window whenever I hit render based on my naming convention. So you could maybe tweak it to fit your naming convention/needs, but that tends to work pretty well for me and is actually even a little easier than making a separate region",
