    "content": "Just for reference, the convo was to restrict my approach to one band of EQ, Q of no sharper than .7 and maybe a low shelf. That's it. And a limiter.\n\nSince then I've done at least over 100 songs, many of which are out in the world and/or on their way to release. So a decent time to circle back with some insight. However, compared to more experienced ears on here I am still a baby.\n\nExtremely powerful challenge from Ruairi, and it really made me think in broad terms about what EQ is doing, what my goals are when using it, and how each part relates to another. And what you gain or lose when making a move. I would highly recommend it, and found it very very hard. It's non-trivial to make things sound better when you actually hear what's happening.\n\n I've also been pretty lucky to work on quite a bit of music that I would have considered outside of my experience range, and I think this gentler approach worked well there because the mixes were already pretty damn good. So there's that too!\n\nOf course for work where I'm being paid I'm not only restricting to one band, I do whatever is needed but even so many times I would prefer that. It felt like \"learning scales\" but for mastering in a way. And loudness really is down mostly to EQ, as far as I can tell!",

    "content": "On that note, can't remember where I found this but a related piano recipe from Michael Brauer. Hoping he hasn't trademarked this one so the Discord doesn't get shut down.\n\n\n\n\"Remember the early Elton John records? Remember how his piano shimmered? At mediasound we loved that sound so a lot of us were always playing around with getting different versions of it. No lacquered hammers, no Dolby A off, just a combination of compression and EQ.\n\n\nI only recorded Luther's voice, may he rest in peace, on that song along with \"searching\" and then mixed both. Luther was on a whole other level of singers. He walked into that session and listened to the song in the control room once, then he walked out into the studio with the lyric sheet in his hand. What you hear on\"Glow of Love\" and \"searching\" is his first fun down reading the lyrics from a yellow pad. No punches.\n\n\nThe piano sound you\u2019re referring to is probably the same one that I did for Vandross on the \u201cNever too much\u201d song.\n\n\nOk, this is how you do it.\n\n1. First insert an LA3A or LA2A (depending on the version of sound you\u2019re going after) across the stereo piano tracks. The LA2A is good if the song is slow and the chords are quarter notes. The LA3A is good if the chords are faster with a harder attack like in \u201cnever too much\u201d. Bang those meters and \n2. out of the compressor go into a couple of pultecs and push up..way up the 3 or 5 k on the low end and the 8 or 10 k on the high end. Don\u2019t be safe. \n3. Now go to the desk EQ and start clearing out some of the muddiness and EQ up the remaining mids so that it just shimmers like a baby. \n4. When it\u2019s done right, you can hear the harmonics riding up during each sustain.  \n5. I remember hearing that song on the radio and man that piano was making me feel good all over. Sounds pretty simple when you know how to do it right?\u201d",

    "content": "I always end up chasing my tail when separating tonal and loudness. If I get the right tonal balance first, then everything shifts around when adding loudness/limiting. To me all limiters and limiter styles within have different tones, at least if I\u2019m limiting more then a couple of dB. For that reason I always start with finding the right limiter/style that keeps or changes the tonal balance the way I want (too bright mix = dark limiter, dull mix = bright limiter, great mix = limiter that keeps the balance when pushed ect.). Once I have the loudness and given the tonal balance a gentle push in the right direction with the limiter, I get the track over the finish line with eq or other tools in front of the limiter. \n\nThis is not meant as criticism of your approach, I just haven\u2019t cracked that code.\nHats of to you for making that work!",

This seems to my ears to not have the bad multiband smearing problems of say fabfilter mb, etc\n\nIn situations where the dynamics down there are out of whack and you need to control the groove better it can really work great, but that specific plugin has odd release characteristics that take time to understand. That same flexibility can allow some subtle control down there that can actually accentuate the groove and fix your problems at the same time.\n\nAs with everything, there are trade offs, it can make the low end sound odd if not careful, and you really need a room that is accurate down there to judge it well I think (now that I\u2019m in my current setup I can very clearly hear when it is helping or hurting)",

    "content": "That makes sense, thanks for the explanation. Reading this, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re miles appart. I used to have one \u00abdefault\u00bb limiter and focus all my moves in front of that, also adding limiter/loudness as the last step. When doing so, I always found myself having to tweak the moves (that I already had \u00abperfectly\u00bb dialed in) because everything would change when adding the final limiter. That\u2019s when I would be chasing my tail \ud83d\ude05\nNow I start with getting the limiter right for the song and then doing eq moves as the second step. This way it it a lot less back and forth for me. I should say I only use one limiter at the time and the limiters I audition with are dmg limitless, fabfilter pro-l2 and Ozone maximizer, with styles I know well. Dmg usually gets used on acoustic and jazz, pro-l2 & ozone for pop/rock. If it is music with vocals I find different styles can really change the way the vocals are percieved, so it\u2019s mostly chosing the style that support the vocals best that is the goal. Using two minuttes to get the right limiter from the start saves me time and uncertainty down the road, and in some cases let\u2019s me use less eq to get the desired result.\nThere are many roads to Rome as they say, I was just interested in yours bc whenever I tried that it ended in a lot of second guessing (for me!). \n\nDo you find yourself having to add more eq when adding limiter at the end to keep the tonal balance you have acheived?",

I think in a way , the broad eq is sort of like a painter taking a few steps back from the canvas having been working up close on a detailed brushstroke (which I\u2019d suggest for example is like a surgical eq move in a mix or saturating a sound at the production stage etc).....\u201dstepping back\u201d and listening not just to The minutiae but the overall tone i think is a discipline that is potentially easy to forget in mix mode ......and in a sense this is how the broad EQ is serving me . I find the eq points ruairi shared work v well at the group bus stage also......for light touches\n\nWith regards to whether I\u2019m only mastering . No, currently my most common paid work comes from local / independent artists in my network I\u2019ve built mostly from my local community outwards through word of mouth. This is primarily in the rnb/trap/hip-hop genres and for better or worse it appears to have been normalised that when someone wants a mix....what they want is a mixter. I\u2019m with Derek Ali\u2019s Enginears platform and even there they are promoting a free master from us as mixers on the platform.\nPersonally, I\u2019m not against certain mixers mastering as well....but i think this is more genre specific.....and also v much down to the individual. I think you spoke about your arc on here into mastering and others have too. ....i believe there is much to benefit from having professional mastering engineers, with thousands of hours under their belt listening to thousands of tracks in excellent environments......take the final listen and make the final adjustments on a mix..and for me, i consider myself on a career arc towards becoming that .",

I was more hybrid earlier on during my conversion period and now mostly all in due to my workflow and client time demands.\n\nI definitely feel like i\u2019m chasing Refs with the same plugins used by mixers and producers sometimes and don\u2019t feel creative but that\u2019s the game lately. I really feel this is the main problem. I\u2019m not really happy when i\u2019m pushed in that direction.\nWith almost everyone having the same plugins it\u2019s very apparent that most masters in a shootout sound the same now. No surprises there.\n\nIs Analog Better?\n\nI recently bought a Terry Audio CEQ to try and change my sound and it definitely works. It has an amazing sound and color that cannot be found in most plugins. That being said it doesn\u2019t work for me all the time.\nMany of the projects i work on are so loud and pushed anything run through analog gear loses the \u201cglue\u201d that is in the digital mix.\nI also just got a Sontec MES-432D9D from Make Believe Studios.\nIt actually sounds like the real thing to me. It has a much different vibe when using it. I find myself using different frequencies from other EQs.\nIs That Better? I\u2019m not sure yet but getting good results when i use both of these tools.\n\nI think the most important part of my setup is that I\u2019m very familiar with my plugins and know when to use different ones when necessary (its also so easier to try another one if you\u2019re not sure obviously)\nI\u2019m constantly trying to stay fresh and not mail it in.\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s an actual answer for this but i hope i answered some of your question or at least validated our situation.\n\nChris\"*",

    "content": "I think time spent de-essing vocals and treating HF content in vinyl prepped masters overrides worrying about how much limiting there is in my opinion. The amount of limiting and how good/bad the cut is really pertinent on the program material itself.  Not the actual amount of gain reduction you are doing because the cutter will literally just turn everything down anywhere between 8-10dB before the signal hits the amps. Excessive sibilance, on a hyper compressed rock record with insane splashy over compressed cymbals and out of control HF information will result in the dull cuts you get back from most plants where you don\u2019t have access to the cutting engineer.  They do this because they want to create a playback safe record and avoid a very expensive $10k mistake like blowing a cutterhead if their amp breakers aren\u2019t calibrated right.  Instead of spot de-essing problem on one song or spot treating problem songs on a side, they will opt for broad stroke moves (HF limiting, EQ, global de-essing) and that can be a bit of death sentence to the quality of the cut and put everyone off vinyl as a format.  Which I think is an incredible format with well crafted engineering.  Also I strongly believe that every record doesn\u2019t belong on vinyl\u2026but that\u2019s another convo.",

Which id call a success.\n\nId brought the Pro q output down 0.4db to compensate the gain increase and printed with no limiter.\n\nIn RX this printed version showed as -7.2 LUFS integrated , -6.3 short term, TP 0.0 .\n\nIdeally id have not touched this again.....i really liked it. \n\nFollowing instructions i then put the L2 Limiter on (modern mode , +0.1 db, TP on and output -0.1) .\n\nTruth be told, once id put the limiter on i wanted to go back into the EQ because i didnt like the sound anymore, i felt the L2 spoilt it.",

Discovered the LWMR podcasts a few months back and have truly loved listening and learning. \n\nI\u2019ve had a note back from a ME that I\u2019ve used a few times via an artist I work with, asking to send an unlimited version of the final mix. \nFinal mix had the limiter off but I mixed into standard clip doing a couple db of soft clipping here and there, pretty minimal, so left that on. \n\nMix bus was: SSL G Comp - Maag EQ - Oxford Inflator - Standard Clip (Soft Clip Pro, 5% Saturation, 8 x oversampling). All very light touches along the way. \n\nSent loud mix to A&R and artist (less than 2db reduction on limiter) but they also approved the pre master in this instance i.e with mix bus on but limiter off. \n\nAlthough the ME has the approved mix already, I\u2019m thinking of sending a version without any clipping and asking to hear 2 versions\u2026\n\nAny thoughts welcomed!",

There is major panning already happening within these tracks\u2026 so I\u2019ve been trialing out imaging tools such as S1 imager, Ozone Imager, T-racks imager, Microshift & Doubler. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s important to be cautious with these plug-ins as they can introduce phasing issues. I\u2019m also finding the stereo sound these plug ins are producing sounds - fake, thin, untasteful and feels as thought is alters the song in negative way. \n\nAt times I thought maybe I\u2019m need more instrumentation within these arrangement to play with panning - but I hear absolutely gorgeous tracks that are simply a vocal and an acoustic guitar that have such a rich deep stereo field (almost as if there were 2 acoustic gtr\u2019s) \n\nI\u2019ve been starting to play with M/S eq and have been having some small wins - but would appreciate and thoughts, views, opinions or direction!\n\nThanks team \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

    "content": "When doing revisions, does anyone save a whole new project file with a version number appended to the end? Wondering if that might help me stay more organized. Currently working on an album where the client wanted to go back to V1 for release, and I swear I kept track of every move I'd made to get to v2, but for some reason I just couldn't get it to sound exactly like V1 again. It's no problem on their end because they just used the file I'd rendered and uploaded to Samply. But now I have a clip in my montage that doesn't match the released version, which I don't like. I ended up dropping the master on a reference track instead.\n\nI think this issue was partially caused because I tend to send an initial rough master too early in the process and they get demo-itis. For some reason I've always wanted to send clients an initial rough master after I've done the quick \"from the gut\" broad strokes, but before I've totally nailed down the nitty gritty stuff, to see if they like the direction I'm headed. And all too often they end up liking the first version.\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking v2 and making it worse on a regular basis? I dunno... \ud83d\ude02",
