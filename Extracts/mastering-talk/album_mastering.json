    "content": "@hebakadry  taught my dumb ass over many years of patience that loudness is built in the mix which really shook up my workflow 8-10 years ago... that being said, after many years of working together we've recently collaborated on a few projects where I intentionally didn't take it easy on the mix bus but still encouraged her to push it further and get as creative & collaborative with the master as she wanted to. It's resulted in some of my favorite sounding records I've ever been a part of. She respected the mix, but took chances and didn't just hand me back my mix. Out the door they were some of my favorite mixes I've ever done and Heba brought something else to them that I couldn't or wouldn't have thought to. I trust her taste & I asked for her imprint. I think there's a way to do both... you can 100% encourage a mastering engineer to push things further and forward without undercooking a mix... but it definitely requires an alignment of taste and trust.",

They love the masters and I\u2019ll be doing their next ep too now . I got the TGP demo, and their settings for it , took the limiter off TGP and applied my own process and got it to where it needed to be with no head scratching or procrastinating. Realistically, I could be still messing about with harmonics and exciters at this point if not for your advice. This discord really GIVES . So, just want to say thanks again. Y\u2019all helped me elevate my workflow in a very tangible way , quickly. I appreciate y\u2019all \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Having spent a considerable chunk of time recording an album for & with my best friend -- we asked Eric Valentine to master the record and he said yes. Having worked under for him for a few years at this point, it felt like a bit of a reckoning... having him critically listen to something I had really poured my all into. Needless to say, he treated it as he treated everything... with genuine curiosity and actionability. He sized up the mixes in no time, told me the strengths, the weaknesses, even sent me into the other room to re-print versions slightly quieter, fix this pop here, maybe put the guitar solo up here. He gave it his full 12 hours (what felt like 100 hours to me) and the end product leveled up in so many ways. Granted he is not really a 'mastering engineer', but he approached this little project like he approached everything in his music career, with a deep sense of giving a fuck and knowing that there's no real excuse to not fix the obvious issues in front of you. The album sounded fantastic and it really spoiled me for what a mastering experience could be.",

    "content": "I\u2019ve been mastering a lot more of my own mixes recently. Mostly because I\u2019m mixing into a mastering chain and generally doing very small moves. So my approach has been to take all my mixes and bypass the limiter and  load the sequence up. I\u2019ll also have my limited mixes below my unlimited mixes in this session. Most the work I\u2019m doing is light rx work and a touch of eq but mostly trying various limiters and limiter settings to see if I can beat what I did in the mix. The real advantage of mastering my own mixes is that once I move heard them in the final sequence I\u2019ll sometimes adjust minor things in the mix. Maybe vocal up or bass down ect.. rather than trying to solve this with 2bus processing. The down side of me mastering is not getting a trusted second perspective",

    "content": "Yes -- definitely save as montage every single time I ship a file, and then before I do any adjusting on a revision. So previous pass is kept as is.\n\nIt depends on how I name it. Like you said, any system that makes sense to you and is granular enough to track all files shipped will work. These days, with albums very often coming in slow dripped as singles, and massive amounts of changes last minute (it's how the game is), it pays to be very organized. I'll even go so far as to name things descriptively if it makes sense for the project (brighter, heavier, etc etc), or by date, whatever. \n\nBut the real work of mastering every day is very messy, and you have to have a good way to track everything.\n\nGranted, I'm more of a \"creative\" type from my experience than a very in the weeds structured type (neither right or wrong), so my system works for me. I can always get exactly back to what was shipped, montage open within under a minute for sure which helps creative flow.\n\nMy 2 cents -- I'd totally do away with the initial rough master. Think of it from the client side. Rough master says \"hey give me validation\" and puts the onus on them to listen. Every interaction incurs a cost. Sending just the master, exactly as you hear it and owning it, works so much better in my experience (believe me, I've been the guy to send options before back in the day).

This allows for less back and forths with mastering and allows them to spend their time on more important moves. If I know I\u2019m mastering my own mixes from the get go.

Eric asked if he'd take a swing a song and he just absolutely crushed it. So we gave him the album and what we got back was hilarious: totally mismatched levels from song to song, some L&R balances totally off whack. Eric ended up going to his studio to figure out what the hell was going on and found all of his shit just wildly out of calibration (he was mastering from 1/2\"). Ended up getting it across the line... the album sounded great, but the experience was... an experience. That being said, super fond memories and he's a lovely guy.",

Now, I\u2019m lucky to be so busy with mastering that I don\u2019t even have time to consider other work. And while I could probably still pull off a passable mix, my friends who do it every day would do a much better job. I think there\u2019s immense value in eventually specializing and putting all your energy into one place.\n\nHaving said that, everyone\u2019s path looks different, and there\u2019s no single right way to get where you want to go.

It's our job to understand that landscape and push fixes to ensure we get perfect playback across all environments. \n\nThat's part of the reason we built the iOS app, to be able to provide a more consistent playback experience when browsers themselves are the limiting factor, and so that clients can listen offline to take the network out of the equation. But I totally understand that you can't really ask a client to install another app on their iPhone. \n\nTo my knowledge, Samply is still the only platform that lets clients stream full resolution lossless AND gapless track transitions in a browser. It's a really tough engineering challenge, but ultimately the backbone of our entire business. We're committed to continuing to solve this problem and evolve with the technology available.",

Clip based processing + automation\n2. Ability to handle markers/delinate what regions and where to render audio quickly and easily. And within album contexts (say we just want to adjust one song, is it easy).\n3. Ability to handle various transition types/seamless\n4. Ability to easily render ALTS or replace mixes (moving settings from one clip to another)\n5. File management, ease of setting up render paths, etc\n\nDefinitely more to it of course for complicated projects",

Unless it\u2019s something wild, better to have the client have a wonderful experience, keep their momentum, don\u2019t introduce doubt, double down on their confidence, etc.\n\nI\u2019m assuming it would be something like making sure the levels and overall tone are right if you\u2019ve already mastered them all and they are in the same ballpark, but feel free to tell me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAlso \u201ccohesion\u201d is massively overrated to me anyway, I much prefer a creatively interesting and varied listening experience if the music calls for it as long as we are not having wild level or EQ swings or something (sometimes it calls for cohesion to have the best listening experience IMO, so know that too!). \n\nI\u2019ve had multiple instances where an artist\u2019s new \u201csingle\u201d release includes their several past singles I\u2019ve mastered too. They didn\u2019t tell me they were doing that, and I mastered each totally alone, just based on the song and their vision. And to be honest those collections sounded totally fine every time as a group of singles, mastered alone.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019d definitely politely educate them on what it exactly entails so it doesn\u2019t happen again in future, and so they can take it into account creatively.\n\nBut of course where you are in your career, the relationship with this client, etc all plays into this.

    "content": "A few thoughts on all this.. I agree with @Nomograph Mastering that the top of funnel for Spotify isn't bringing in enough money to overnight increase the amount music rights holders are paid. However, I am not convinced Spotify couldn't raise their subscription price in certain markets. Netflix has successfully raised their prices many times over the years. I've been paying the same price for Spotify for close to 10 years (maybe it increased a dollar at one point, but not sure).\n\nI do believe Daniel Ek and Spotify have earned some ire from the music community. Ek is a billionaire and the average Spotify employee makes close to $110k / year. You would probably need around ~1.5 million monthly listeners and ~3.5 million streams / month to earn an equivalent amount (master recording side sans publishing and no other income stream). There are maybe a little over 6000 artists that have that large of a listenership in the entire world out of conservatively 5-7 million artists on the platform.\n\nThere are many things Spotify could do to improve economic outcomes for artists / musicians. Here are a few in no particular order:\n1) Allow artists to link to their own website. Believe it or not we can't do this. Your own website is the one piece of online real estate that you actually control. On Spotify, IG, Tiktok, etc... you are playing in someone else's sandbox.\n2) Allow artists more control over their profiles and the way they are laid out. One thing that infuriates me is how Spotify sorts albums by popularity rather than release date. I would like to change that. This would be beneficial to promoting newer releases. As well all external links off of Spotify are virtually hidden on the 'about' page at the bottom of your profile making it harder for fans to follow you where you want to be followed.",

There\u2019s plenty of potential for those stories. \n\nMusic is brilliant to me, like 808 music on opioids, and a teenager engineer made it significantly leaner than pale waves (in more than one song 9k is 10db louder than 2k) and sent it to distro with true peak all the way down at -3.\n\nThe artist is like a little brother to me, is 10/10 serious about being a full time artist, and I think the music itself deserves an editorial playlist spot (he\u2019s landed 2 before!) but the sonics on this album are prohibitive so I\u2019m trying to quickly do a master swap for him. \n\nThere\u2019s no way for this to sound fully traditional (and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d want it to). It will be punk, it will be weird. The goal now is for the quirks to be a portal into a new experience rather than a barrier between the artist and the listener. Very delicate to navigate",

When working hybrid, I try to keep the same settings for a whole album and do eq, de-essing and level automation pre analog if needed (on individual tracks).

When printing the album I use the print-time to casually listen to the album from start to finish to catch stuff I would like to adjust (one track lacks impact ect.). Final limiter is always post analog print and I do not print hot. This makes revisions a breeze 97% of the time, unless there is a new mix of course. Also easy to back of a limiter without reprinting if the client wants more dynamics or I want a more dynamic vinyl pre-master. Hope that made sense.",

I think in a way , the broad eq is sort of like a painter taking a few steps back from the canvas having been working up close on a detailed brushstroke (which I\u2019d suggest for example is like a surgical eq move in a mix or saturating a sound at the production stage etc).....\u201dstepping back\u201d and listening not just to The minutiae but the overall tone i think is a discipline that is potentially easy to forget in mix mode ......and in a sense this is how the broad EQ is serving me . I find the eq points ruairi shared work v well at the group bus stage also......for light touches\n\nWith regards to whether I\u2019m only mastering . No, currently my most common paid work comes from local / independent artists in my network I\u2019ve built mostly from my local community outwards through word of mouth. This is primarily in the rnb/trap/hip-hop genres and for better or worse it appears to have been normalised that when someone wants a mix....what they want is a mixter. I\u2019m with Derek Ali\u2019s Enginears platform and even there they are promoting a free master from us as mixers on the platform.\nPersonally, I\u2019m not against certain mixers mastering as well....but i think this is more genre specific.....and also v much down to the individual. I think you spoke about your arc on here into mastering and others have too. ....i believe there is much to benefit from having professional mastering engineers, with thousands of hours under their belt listening to thousands of tracks in excellent environments......take the final listen and make the final adjustments on a mix..and for me, i consider myself on a career arc towards becoming that .",

If the songs are recorded by the same person, mixed by the same person, and they all come my way for mastering - I usually don\u2019t have a problem keeping things consistent enough over the course of a few weeks. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful ! \n\nAlso want to add the goal is not every song same level. Just keeping in mind how the project will flow overall and having that info in front of me I find helpful sometimes when a lot of time has passed.",

I was more hybrid earlier on during my conversion period and now mostly all in due to my workflow and client time demands.\n\nI definitely feel like i\u2019m chasing Refs with the same plugins used by mixers and producers sometimes and don\u2019t feel creative but that\u2019s the game lately. I really feel this is the main problem. I\u2019m not really happy when i\u2019m pushed in that direction.\nWith almost everyone having the same plugins it\u2019s very apparent that most masters in a shootout sound the same now. No surprises there.\n\nIs Analog Better?\n\nI recently bought a Terry Audio CEQ to try and change my sound and it definitely works. It has an amazing sound and color that cannot be found in most plugins. That being said it doesn\u2019t work for me all the time.\nMany of the projects i work on are so loud and pushed anything run through analog gear loses the \u201cglue\u201d that is in the digital mix.\nI also just got a Sontec MES-432D9D from Make Believe Studios.\nIt actually sounds like the real thing to me. It has a much different vibe when using it. I find myself using different frequencies from other EQs.\nIs That Better? I\u2019m not sure yet but getting good results when i use both of these tools.\n\nI think the most important part of my setup is that I\u2019m very familiar with my plugins and know when to use different ones when necessary (its also so easier to try another one if you\u2019re not sure obviously)\nI\u2019m constantly trying to stay fresh and not mail it in.\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s an actual answer for this but i hope i answered some of your question or at least validated our situation.\n\nChris\"*",

Find it pretty common that mixers just deliver it all to avoid the exact situation you describe...an INST print 6 months down the line randomly or whatever. If I mixed I'd do the same probably. \n\nBut also often enough the artist doesn't even know there is an ALT deliverable given to me and I seriously think they don't even want or need it in some (maybe a lot) of cases (of course some do). Just something I need to communicate up front about in the future whenever I decide to make a move. I had just been including them for ease of the process and I needed all the reps to know to do it right...but now that I got the ALT flow covered, know the QC and issues that can pop up...the time and care I spend just isn't reasonable with the amount of work I have right now.\n\nWhich like @peterlabberton said, could just evaporate. It all feels so ephemeral so I'm just jamming on ways forward, I'm extremely grateful for anyone who sends me stuff. Lots of good talk here. I sorta didn't expect to be anywhere near this discussion for years so not sure if I'm just kidding myself or things are going well haha",

I think you kind of answered your own questions. $10 is crazy low and not sustainable for anyone, I'm not sure what that other engineer could actually be doing besides blasting tracks through Ozone. Since you are already cold emailing, I think your time could be better sent searching out artists who are in need of an ME and get your full rate there. If you took the $10/gigs, they would eventually be dropped anyways as more full rate gigs started coming in. If it were me, I would rather work the word of mouth game through the artists you are DMing and hopefully more gigs stream in that way via other artists, producers, or mixers. Put in the work now creating meaningful relationships and connections that can exponentially grow instead of the label path which seems like a dead end. I've been cold DMing artists with a freebie first song, I just started this month and it's a big numbers game, so I can't say for certain how it will go. But, because of the freebie I gave them, I am now talking with these different artists about mastering an album, an EP, and several singles at full rate. This is rhetorical, but how many cheap label songs would you need to master in order to get the same amount of money? So in short, if it were me, I would spend my time elsewhere creating more meaningful relationships with much more room to grow.",

Generally I got his concept and certainly understand when he talked about becoming so good at sound design he felt he could effectively mimic any master. It all made sense to me , my surprise is particular to the plug in. I don\u2019t know if anyone else has here experience of it, but after all the fanfare when it was released I\u2019ve found the J unusable but Clearly he didn\u2019t. So I was surprised by the choice specifically. Also I suppose, knowing that Ali mixes hybrid and sums his groups through analogue ssl boards as part of his workflow, it seems ironic to me to think after all that it gets put straight into an emulation of one channel  of said board. \n\nI personally like the bpm thing as I do 60;000 /bpm/measure  to dial in a quick ballpark release time (in ozone dynamics) then tweak by feel at  volume . It lets me get to the pulse I want quickly ime , I\u2019m going to have  a good read of the link shared above on the L2  over a coffee now, thanks for sharing  @Adam Thein",

Or think more deeply about where your time is best spent?\n\nI ask because I\u2019m a super intuitive-type when I master, but I like to devote very focused some time to rendering my tools to deep knowledge \u201cavailable\u201d in that intuitive flow. Probably on the @Rollmottle tip. But my science brain craves the technical understanding. \n\nThere is only so much time in our lives and I\u2019m curious if you think about how you time is best spent \u2014 mastering vs working on very technical things that I would argue offer no value to the actual artistic mastering process (minus having a good listen environment).\n\nTrying to tie this back to the \u201cmakes a difference\u201d vs \u201cmatters\u201d thing\u2026I think it\u2019s great that there is so much enthusiasm for deep dives (ala @Zack Hames ) on here but I can\u2019t help but think there would be little to no actionable info for most of us in what you two discuss! Sometimes I wonder if reading these threads gives me a false sense of accomplishment\u2026like I now understand something that will never matter for me (and I could have just mastered a song instead)\n\nAs always, there is a balance and I\u2019m trying to find my own\u2026you two are just doing both the mastering and acoustics at such a high level I had to ask!",

I found myself only ever consistently using the top 2 bands because of the low-end mushiness. When I'm talking low-end mushiness, we are talking really subtle shades of gray, but at this stage can really make or break how a master hits, especially when thumpy kick drums are so critical to almost everything. It works a treat on drumless/acoustically oriented stuff, but that's more the exception of what flows across my desk than the rule. \n\nWhat I moved on to from the MP (the Gyraf G14S) gives me what I want when I'm going out without the inherent trade off in the low end. The ability to use it in either solid state or tube topology made it a no-brainer for me. It just does \"the thing\" cleaner and better than the MP. Where the MP is rich and dark, the Gyraf is rich and cleaner. I think at the end of the day, \"tube\" wasn't the thing I was looking for.",

    "content": "I rarely will discount for more songs. I have learned the more songs often the \"longer\" it takes to make them all play nice with each other especially in 2025 where I might get a record that is from the label with 3 mixers, 13 songs over 3 years of single release then ep, then remixed, then all put together to be \"the album\". I  honestly can never copy and paste settings either 99% of the time from song to song which I think some clients assume, well you dial one in so the rest should be faster. Sometimes the record is super consistent and it is \"faster\" in theory, but due dillgence is still needed on every song start finish, then if you get the track list or sequence and its a little complicated or they got high energy next to ballads next to high energy etc. You have to manage how that flows as well. SO I find singles are \"easy\" ...EP are little harder..... LP to get out the door, with each song reaching its potential while feeling cohesive often takes more \"time\". So no discounts. I will sometimes discount the total budget if the people are good, music is good and the budget is not my normal rate. SOMETIMES though I ask them to save up haha... because most can and most have rarely thought about that.",

Is this good or bad? I don't know haha.. but its part of the gig I have found and something i accepted. Ironically i made a career and enough money off plugins lol to then buy all this gear lol... at this stage the gear is more for me and the way I like to work when time allows it. I adore gear.. but workflow and turn around time makes it sometimes impossible to use.",

This is a double-album, 21-song project that I already discounted more than I probably should have based on the amount of time i've already put into the project because of all of the unexpected needs of the client. I keep trying to accommodate the needs as best I can, because the client is so kind and this is a project he is very passionate about. The issue is that the publicist is asking for things that she isn't fully able to be very clear about (I think maybe because she is somewhat inexperienced and doesn't know what it is she actually needs), and it's starting to approach a level in which I'm providing a lot of stuff for no charge--even though at the moment, I'm swamped and starting to get a little stressed trying to squeeze other projects in and also trying to wrap this up and get the client everything he needs. For some background, I had to re-make the DDPs because the client changed some song title information after I had already done the due diligence of confirming with him that all of the information was correct. now, his publicist, who had originally requested embedded MP3s with all of the album/artist/sequence info and album art for the album and also five singles, is now saying she meant to say she needed wavs.",

(DDP, .wav, .mp3, even vinyl, etc...) \n\nLet's say you have your track markers formatted as : **#TITLE=songtitle|PERFORMER=artist|ISRC=666** etc., aside of the \"!\" marker at the beginning for the 2sec gap and the last \"@\" marker for the album metadata.\nYour session is now ready for a DDP export.\nThen, if you want to render .mp3 and/or .wav you have to use the wildcard : **$marker(#TITLE)[|]** in the file name entry, aside to other wildcards you'll need for folder structures etc. Also, the options :  \"Bounds : All project markers\" and \"do not render files that are likely silent\" are needed and will prevent rendering the empty first 2 sec marker.\nTo automatically include metadata in the files, you can use the same wildcards such as : **$marker(#TITLE)[|]** for Title,** $marker(PERFORMER)[|]** for Artist, **$marker(ISRC)[|]** for ISRC, etc etc...\n\nWith this method, you can, with one single workflow, render : DDPs, digital formats, and even vinyl, using additional regions. Once you have everything ready in render presets, it's super easy.\nI recommend using the \"WyattRice DDP editor\" to easily edit the markers.\nI've also made a script to automatically generate a .html \"PQ sheet\" file with timings, titles, ISRCs, etc, (both CD and Vinyl)\n\nI hope it can help, English is not my native language, so feel free to ask for clarifications if needed.",

I'm curious about other's approaches and work flows for mastering albums specifically.\n\nI also have a more targeted question. I am wondering, in a world where most modern records take up all available headroom are relative track balance decisions (i.e. *I want the final chorus of track 3 to be the loudest perceived part of the entire album*) made at the input stage of the final limiter? Choosing less gain reduction via limiting or compression as well as distortion / saturation rather than turning a track down. Seems like a ratchet towards clipping, distortion, and lack of dynamic range and transient detail. Sure that's a whole can of worms but would be interested to discuss it. \ud83e\udd18",

Both approaches work but have different implications that have to be decided based on artistic intent.\n\nBut specifically for albums (and all mastering generally) working off intuition always works so much better for me. This also means you have to sort of practice outside of \u201cgame time\u201d so the tools flow when in the moment. Able to work quicker so you keep the entire project in mind. Mastering is a game of trade offs both in songs themselves and between them.\n\nAlso IMO \u201ccohesion\u201d is totally overrated in mastering albums. I never care (or even know, honestly) as a listener if song 8 sounds cohesive with song 1. I just care that the arc of the album moves me",

This may be \"normal\" but sometimes it's just not the move. Just did an album where one song wanted to be more compressed/limited. So we did that but just literally turned down the gain on the output so it fit better with another quieter (more dynamic, not output level) track before it to match the \"loudness\" of the two more closely.\n\nHard to give any other insight because so much of it is dependent on the actual songs you have, what the artist's vision is, how to serve that, etc. Dynamics/energy/loudness plays a big part in that!",

I have both RX and Spectralayers setup that way. \u00a0The only annoying thing is that you can\u2019t have 2x ASIO running at the same instance which is very annoying. So I have to disable ASIO in my audio setup in Sequoia before I pull up RX..this is only if I want to STAY in the session. \u00a0Of course you can use it standalone as you know. \u00a0Anyways, it\u2019s just a different workflow.",

Granted this is only in the metadata but I still want to have that correct.\n\nThe other option is to replace clip with the alt version and then render it separately saved as a new montage file. I want a way to do it all in one project and restart the track numbering on each alt version.\n\nDoes anyone know if that\u2019s possible, or just how are you handling it?\n\nI ask because I do know how to do it multiple ways but I\u2019d like to be more efficient for revisions, etc\u2026say if someone wants to change a fade I\u2019m not going through 4 montages to get all the alts too",

In different sample rates. Obviously I want to deliver the project in a single sample rate. But we don't want the song to be counted as two separate releases, plays, etc when it goes to streaming.\n\nI'm assuming as long as the files are exactly the same length, when uploaded to streaming and using the same ISRC on the distribution side it shouldn't matter if there is a discrepancy in sample rate right between the \"new\" master and the previously released one right?",

I've been willing to address notes with this artist but my approach is to tell them that it might be a good idea to sit with it and get back to me on notes.\nI had done a V1 pass of the album, then a V2 one when the artist wanted to change things in the mixes, and now they're sitting with V3. Just trying to minimize the tail chasing and serve the songs the best I can",

    "content": "Hi, I\u2019m not a mastering engineer but I did a sort of mastering experiment recently:\n\nI was watching the Mix with the Masters videos with Randy Merrill and Idania Valencia, and I noticed that they were using plain old input gain before their limiter to push it instead of increasing the threshold of the limiter itself, so their limiter thresholds/gains were at 0. I thought maybe they knew something I didn\u2019t.\n\nSo I tried it. I put a gain plugin before my limiter and pushed the limiter with it. The results? It sounds awful. All the punch and width is gone. Change back to using the limiter\u2019s threshold, sounds great.\n\nAny technical reason for this? I was using the Kilohearts Gain plugin in to Ozone Maximizer, but I would be hard pressed if it was one of those plugins at fault. Maybe the threshold of the limiter has an internal signal flow that changes its behavior as opposed to gain coming in to it or something? Maybe this workflow makes better sense in Sequoia for the Sterling engineers for some reason?",

But for other limiters (limitless, Pro L2), I haven't noticed a big difference between what you're suggesting -- very open to being wrong about that though!",

But accordingly meausre much lower (loudest is -11 LUFS). \n\nSo with the new info Dale posted the other day re: how Spotify is normalizing levels, I thought let's just turn down the louder one a little to see how it fits (it's fine), maybe that can buy us a db or whatever for the other songs when they normalize to the loudest song as long as the creative intent is preserved (it is). And that's cool. But actually a better result IMO was to just ease up on the loudness of the first song (at -8.4 LUFS), it makes more sense in the project being a bit more dynamic rather than having the dense one be pulled down.\n\nQuestion is: will this cause the single version to be replaced by the new album one when going to distro?\n\nI've had masters that we replaced before with a lowered ceiling in projects and all was fine, but the actual master was exactly the same minus the ceiling, so in a single context it would normalize the same. I know to keep exact length to ms, etc etc. \n\nBut the new info Dale posted makes me rethink how to handle this in albums (on Spotify -- on Apple is doesn't seem to be doing that?)",

About a year ago I noticed that a label I work with was submitting my non-ADM files to Apple as ADM and still getting certified. I asked the label to use the ADM files in the future as I didnt want to risk my accreditation. They responded that nothing had been flagged by distribution nor by Apple but they would do so moving forward.\n\nFlash forward to this year - I noticed that some ADM files from other engineers had overs, not just clipping but significant overs, check the newest Olivia Rodrigo album. According to the aforementioned document, definitely not to spec hahah.\n\nFlash forward from there to about a month ago, I submitted my standard formats to another label I work with including standard streaming WAV as well as an ADM file. Through chatting with their distribution team it came to light that at the distro end of things they could only upload 1 file (the ADM) and this file would be delivered to each DSP in the specs they can receive, which I found very interesting since the ADM file is occasionally different than the other streaming WAVs.",

What I really meant was in the event of a revision request. \n\nFor example, I worked on a song this week with a jazz quartet instrumentation and a singer with a bit of a lisp. Super dynamic mix, the upright bass had a lot of wild moments that needed to be reigned in. Always gonna follow my gut on the to first pass, but also recognize the singer\u2019s potential sensitivity to how their lisp comes across on the recording. I just opted to focus on the instrumentals on the first pass in RX, save the file, duplicate it, then work from that and focus on vocals. They approved on the first pass, but if I had to go back to the drawing board on the vocals, for example, I did not want to have to go through every note plucked on the upright bass again and would be thankful to have that \u2018RX_INST\u2019 file on hand.\n\nWhich I guess brings up another workflow question: are you splitting focus when in RX and doing multiple passes, or just play through once addressing whatever it is you hear as you go?",

Right now, what I\u2019m doing is setting up a mastering session with all the latest mixes (with limiting applied), doing the track list, and listening to the differences between them\u2014things like timbre, balance, loudness, etc. I make notes of what I hear, then go back to the mix sessions to make small tweaks. After that, I export everything without the final clipping/limiting on the tracks, so I can apply those in the final mastering session and then master the album. Anyone with a different approach is more than welcome to share, as right now I\u2019m wrapping up a lot of albums I\u2019ve worked on throughout the year, and I want to stay as sharp as possible to give them a proper finish.",

This mindset makes me really nervous, like if they want it brighter and the snare to snap a little more and stuff, that should be handled in the mix. I don't want to do endless revisions, but if you tell me after 4 rounds of revisions there's additional stuff you want changed, I'd rather just do it. Why do a stem master? Feeling like it's getting into the weeds and over-complicating things but maybe I'm missing something about what's expected at the mastering stage",

The quality settings never seem to work and it constantly has problems with playback. Not playing at all either mid album or when I try to start a specific track, skipping tracks, and even weirder is if I'm listening to one album and then switch to a different one, it'll often throw in a track from the old album while acting like it's still playing the new one",

So at least timing wise, listening to an album with gapless playback enabled should exactly match the master.",

After a bit of research I found out that it might have something to do with cd mastering, but I didn't really understand how that sored of drastic cut happens or is achieved or with cd mastering ?\nAnd is cd mastering different than 'normal' mastering\n?",

When mastering an album with multiple tracks, do you find yourselves making a lot of hardware adjustments for each track, or do you stick to a simpler setup and handle most changes digitally?\n\nAlso, do you usually print the hardware return before limiting, or is that not really an issue in your workflow?",

In theory I know playlisting may not make a difference, but the single\u2019s stream counts make us feel like it\u2019s important enough to consider. The album was released in 2022, so re-releasing it as a different version is definitely an option as well\u2014but curious if any of you have any experience in remasters/rereleases etc and have any opinions or advice on different ways this could be handled!",

But once that\u2019s done, you\u2019re not stuck endlessly tweaking, it\u2019s actually the other way around. It becomes streamlined, efficient, and allows you to focus entirely on mastering music instead of fighting with the software.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to whether you\u2019re willing to invest the time and patience to make it work for you. It\u2019s perfectly valid if you\u2019d rather not go through that process but if you do, you\u2019ll likely find that Reaper is unmatched for mastering.",

    "content": "Ah yes, I actually didn\u2019t mean that you work from stems. Did not mean to imply that! Rather I meant that I\u2019ve heard from people who have used you that the approach tends to be (and again do not mean to imply it\u2019s always) more transformative than other engineers. They say this is a good way! And I\u2019m a big fan of your work\n\nI too will do something like that when it\u2019s asked or called for, recently a mixer I work with often (without stems) wanted me to work from stems for a certain reason on an album. Down.\n\nOr maybe a few times a year a producer will want me to work from a session for a certain reason. In the vein of what @oaklandmatt was talking about a while back. \n\nVery not standard. But falls into the get the record to the finish line part of the job, when it\u2019s the right move it can work great",

    "content": "Additionally, I know some artists love to comp thoroughly after the fact but it could be helpful (and idk your current workflow so you may already do this) to go one of two routes:\n1. color code any specific takes that may be keepers outright\n2. try to be as intentional as possible while tracking so you're building the comp as you go and you know when you get \"the take\"\n\nMost of the vocals I track are comped, edited, and aligned on the fly while tracking. It took me years of practice to be able to do all that while still paying attention to the current take that's being sung but I find artists love the speed they can see their song come together",
