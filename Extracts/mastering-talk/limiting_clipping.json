If you are above that number and the user has normalization enabled, the service will turn the music down to match that number.\n\nThe immediate problems baked in:\n1. Every service works differently. One cannot confidently shoot at a target that doesn\u2019t really exist. So, just master the material for the material.\n2. Not every user has normalization turned on. Thus, the material will be arbitrarily quiet next to other material that isn\u2019t mastered to the target. So, just master the material for the material.\n3. Not everybody consumes through streaming. Outside of a platform, the material needs to stand on its own. So, just master the material for the material.\n4. Lots of modern music benefits sonically from being pushed into a limiter. Mastering below that short changes the material. So, just master the material for the material.",

They love the masters and I\u2019ll be doing their next ep too now . I got the TGP demo, and their settings for it , took the limiter off TGP and applied my own process and got it to where it needed to be with no head scratching or procrastinating. Realistically, I could be still messing about with harmonics and exciters at this point if not for your advice. This discord really GIVES . So, just want to say thanks again. Y\u2019all helped me elevate my workflow in a very tangible way , quickly. I appreciate y\u2019all \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

    "content": "Story time - I was asked to master a song that is above my paygrade, I was  super stoked to land the gig. I got the limited ref and the unlimited mix, and went to town doing \u201cmy thing\u201d as usual. After some time I went for the A/B - and the ref was BLOWING my shit out of the water. To provide a little context, I have been mastering seriously for 6 years, and in the least ego driven way possible, usually always \u201cmy thing\u201d beats whatever limited ref I am up against. I have not been in many scenarios where I can\u2019t beat the ref. With this song that was not the case at all. On the advice shared here previously, I got in touch with the mixer and asked what was going on with his loudness chain. \n\nDudes, it was so much. Two BOZ clippers, a gullfoss, stacked limiters - the works. However - the limited ref was dripping in vibe. The mixer bullseye\u2019d this song. It was totally ON POINT and my chain was getting nowhere close. I considered going the route of screenshots and recreate the mixers madness step by step - but TBH - I did not want to drag the project through all that especially with me being brought on as a new ME to an already established team that is above my paygrade, and my ears and heart knew that the limited ref was right on the money anyway.\n\nI needed a vote of confidence , so I asked a close friend (cough @Nomograph Mastering ) who is ahead of me in this game if it was acceptable for me to work from the limited ref. (showing my greenness here). A great word of advice came through - \u201cThe only rule is what gives the best final outcome.\u201d - I made the call to work from the ref. The final chain was so simple - standard clip, equilibrium, limitless. 3 moves. Nothing going crazy. Got an over the top enthusiastic approval this morning, and am so freakin stoked about the whole thing, will probably get the whole project.",

Each attack/release time is given a distortion and masking score and the best score is selected. The different IRC modes prioritize different types of scores (eg. IRC I prioritizes low pumping and distortion, IRC II is similar to IRC I but prioritizes transients more, etc). \nIzotope is a little cagey on the exact process they use to arrive at each IRC mode, but the manual does a pretty good job of explaining how each mode feels. IRC IV Transient is basically a multiband version of the other IRC modes that prioritizes transients, although Izotope says IRC V is its first multiband limiter in Ozone, so there is maybe more to the story there",

Don\u2019t mono the bass, don\u2019t change the EQ etc \n\n3) Make a single WAV file of each side, and a set of timing notes that show where each track starts and the length so the cutting engineer can place the track banding / markers\n\n4) I like to highlight anomalies that may present a challenge for cutter but it\u2019s not necessary",

Most the work I\u2019m doing is light rx work and a touch of eq but mostly trying various limiters and limiter settings to see if I can beat what I did in the mix. The real advantage of mastering my own mixes is that once I move heard them in the final sequence I\u2019ll sometimes adjust minor things in the mix. Maybe vocal up or bass down ect.. rather than trying to solve this with 2bus processing. The down side of me mastering is not getting a trusted second perspective",

The dynamics, combined with the *type of low frequency* content of those genres at that time, along with DJ\u2019s who knew what the fuck they were doing, along with sound crews who worked the rave circuit and were continually hired and worked with the same DJ\u2019s, all contributed so much to this magic rave Vinyl era.\nThere\u2019s nothing that touched those deep kickass lows back then, But That was the style! \nSo much has changed. Producers back then got their loudness from pushing analog desks into the red, Simple Mackie desks, stuff like that. But We moved to an all digital world. I remember when the first pioneer digital DJ mixers came out, I\u2019d put a vinyl on and just be like\u2026this is shit! where\u2019s my headroom?!?! the frequency distribution of the music has also changed, DJ\u2019s also got more concerned with jumping up and down and clapping rather than mixing and gain staging.

If they took that stuff off, I\u2019d be totally lost. But they like a little analog processing in a lot of cases.

And a limiter.\n\nSince then I've done at least over 100 songs, many of which are out in the world and/or on their way to release. So a decent time to circle back with some insight. However, compared to more experienced ears on here I am still a baby.\n\nExtremely powerful challenge from Ruairi, and it really made me think in broad terms about what EQ is doing, what my goals are when using it, and how each part relates to another. And what you gain or lose when making a move. I would highly recommend it, and found it very very hard. It's non-trivial to make things sound better when you actually hear what's happening.\n\n I've also been pretty lucky to work on quite a bit of music that I would have considered outside of my experience range, and I think this gentler approach worked well there because the mixes were already pretty damn good. So there's that too!\n\nOf course for work where I'm being paid I'm not only restricting to one band, I do whatever is needed but even so many times I would prefer that. It felt like \"learning scales\" but for mastering in a way. And loudness really is down mostly to EQ, as far as I can tell!",

There's a sort of \"center of gravity\" for the frequency of instruments. Individual instruments did not need as much low end as I once thought. I realized that I could push more energy up into the mids and upper-mids. Instruments could be leaner and biting. Much more than I thought tolerable. This has a few positive effects:\n\n1. The sounds will cut more and be articulate in the mix (if desired).\n\n2. Low-end buildup is the first thing that's going to hit your limiter. Shifting the energy up the frequency spectrum buys you more space before your limiter kicks in. Thus your overall mix can be louder.\n\n3. Your low-end instruments will no longer compete to feel powerful. Therefore they do not need to be as loud in an absolute/voltage sense. Meanwhile, your midrange-y instruments that were once lean and bite-y in isolation are supplemented by your low-end instruments and feel whole again.",

    "content": "@Rollmottle already gave a great answer here. I want to re-state and co-sign what he posted \n\n1. Don't try and remove what you can't hear. Never going to end well. There is no general rule sub 30hz so don't try and preemptively deal with something if you're not even sure it's an issue\n2. If you do need to deal with a low end issue, deal with it at the source, instead of the 2-mix if you can\n3. If you're dealing with it at the 2-mix level, gentle shelves will do less harm than steep cuts\n\nOk. Now to a thornier aspect of your question - does throwing away super low end information help us with loudness?\n\nAs I\u2019ve said many times here our typical goal is not just maximum loudness. The goal is really high perceived loudness, and low measured loudness (to avoid being turned down too much by normalization), all while remaining musical and true to the intent of the song\n\nPerceived loudness is primarily driven by arrangement (less elements better), distortion (more distortion makes things feel louder but at obvious cost) and frequency content (special attention needs to be paid to the 1500 to 6000 region I mentioned the other day). Super low end content doesn\u2019t have too much of a direct effect on how we perceive loudness but of course it does have second order effects - huge lows will cause limiters to overwork and we\u2019ll get into trouble with things sounding smashed sooner than we\u2019d like\n\nOk, but what of measured loudness? Here it pays to have an understanding of how LUFS are actually calculated. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a neat summary video somewhere Dan Worrall style, if so please link it in folks. The definitive doc on LUFS measurement is here \n\nhttps://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-5-202311-I!!PDF-E.pdf",

Even if 99% of users don't give a shit about the perfect playback, we do. That's why we have that \"lossless\" switch. We'll never switch to AAC due to bandwidth issues.\n\nThe \"constant upgrades\" are often due to the ever changing landscape of browsers. Each client is often on a different browser, different device and different internet connection. It's our job to understand that landscape and push fixes to ensure we get perfect playback across all environments. \n\nThat's part of the reason we built the iOS app, to be able to provide a more consistent playback experience when browsers themselves are the limiting factor, and so that clients can listen offline to take the network out of the equation. But I totally understand that you can't really ask a client to install another app on their iPhone. \n\nTo my knowledge, Samply is still the only platform that lets clients stream full resolution lossless AND gapless track transitions in a browser. It's a really tough engineering challenge, but ultimately the backbone of our entire business. We're committed to continuing to solve this problem and evolve with the technology available.",

This is an email that Nomogrpah wrote back to a client that said \"Hey I love the master so much but I am a bit worried about how much it might get turned down ?\" or something to that effect \n\nResponse was \n\n\"Glad you are feeling the master!\n\nRe the level thing that is a complicated question. A few thoughts\n\nNot everyone has loudness normalization turned on. It also doesn\u2019t exist on Smart TVs, many streaming web interfaces etc\n\nThe different services all have different level norm targets (and even different settings within just Spotify) - and they change pretty regularly\n\nIn terms of absolute level when normalization is active what matters is arrangement (dense mixes sound quieter than sparse/spacious mixes), EQ (bright/mid range forward mixes sound louder than dark) and distortion levels (clipped/distorted mixes feel perceptually louder than clean). If I make a master a dB louder in mastering using just limiting for example, they just turn it down a dB more when it\u2019s level normed.\n\nSo what does all of this mean? It means that every song has sweet spot where the EQ/tone, the arrangement and the overall clipping/limiting level works best and communicates the intent. That\u2019s what we aim for.\n\nYou can use a site like loudnesspenalty.com to see what will happen but it will just drive you crazy and the only real way to meaningfully alter the result is to change the arrangement/mix or overall EQ a lot. On release day you can find 1000 records that are louder than yours if you want to.\n\nIf being the loudest is the intent - game everything listed above and you can \u201cwin\u201d. If doing your unique thing and communicating a song and a performance is the goal then I think you are there!\"\n\n(posted with Nomographs permission)",

    "content": "Yeah. I immediately change the frequency graph to *Log* or *Extended Log*. This allows me to see the low-end and midrange with more resolution. It's the same reason most EQ graphs keep the octaves evenly spaced so that 50% of your freq graph isn't 10kHz and up. It gives you more resolution for the notes in the lower octaves.\n\nAs for FFT size or window shape, I never change it, but as Ruairi alluded to it requires an understanding of the physical limitations of FFT's. \n\nIn short if you want very fine frequency information displayed you can change the window size and lose rhythmic information. But it you want very precise rhythmic visualization you have to sacrifice how much frequency information the FFT can display. So the ideal setting ultimately depends on what problem you're trying to solve.",

I\u2019m getting similar stuff (limited, heated ref, unlimited), and honestly I find I\u2019m using the ref certainly some of the time and working from there. Sometimes there is just magic there, and while my chain may be \u201cbetter\u201d it\u2019s also just different, especially when I can tell people are mixing into that ref chain.\n\nI guess I just mention because going into my new \u201crole\u201d in mastering I made a very conscious decision to only operate on a binary: is what I\u2019m doing making the record feel better to me or not? Is it becoming more of what it wants to be?\n\nAnd throw out any notions of what I felt I \u201cshould\u201d be doing.\n\nIn some ways being very new has given me a great creative armor, I am not afraid to lose and therefore do not feel bad or something if the ref is a better starting point than my chain or if I am doing very little.\n\nI am fascinated in your perspective as someone who is a pros pro but in between where I am and where Ruairi is.\n\nI\u2019ll land the plane here\u2026it seems like the fact that this song was \u201cabove your pay grade\u201d sort of played into the fact that you were maybe seeking Ruairi\u2019s approval to use that limited ref?\n\nDo you think you would have approached using the ref any differently if you knew it was just some kid in a bedroom, or would you have still trusted that it was still the move to use it?\n\nI ask myself this stuff a lot, since I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m always doing exactly what is right for the song, but of course many factors play into our decision making (insecurity, relationships, fear of losing a project, etc)\n\nSorry for the rant, but your story was very inspiring!

Some mixers only like to deliver a limited version, some will hop on the phone and we chat if they have a question about something on the mix bus, so there is a range. It's incredibly rare that I would have someone undoing what's on their mixbus that they made decisions through. I've never seen it help a record unless it's some truly heavy handed stuff they just threw on without any intention.\n\nSo there's a wide range --nothing that's \"right\" from my view. EDM tends to be more specialized, but any competent engineer should be easy to work with and tell you what's up\n\nKeep in mind I'm not on Ruairi level -- newer to the game but I do this all day everyday, just my observations. Many younger /more inexperienced people I work with (not saying this is you) think that undoing the mixbus will give me \"more room to work\", when it's often and especially those cases what is holding the entire record together",

    "content": "In modern record making clipping and limiting on the buss is a huge part of the overall sound and feel of a record. Kendrick for example never heard his productions, mixes or masters without it. Clipping has an energy in the kicks and snares that was built a certain way, limiting has rounding and smoothing characteristics and often \"holds\" the track in a particular way. You can't just bypass one , or the other or both without huge changes in groove, balance, tone and feel. (Swapping limiters for something *safer* can be equally damaging) \n\nWhat does clipping actually do? It creates square waves at the extreme (for the duration of the clipping)\n\nWhat is a square wave? It is a fundamental with a bunch of odd harmonics trailing off in level\n\nWhat happens when you low pass the square wave at the converter reconstruction filter, lathe low pass etc? It is no longer a square wave\n\nDoes cutting this no longer square wave to a disc for brief periods present challenges and cause extra momentary distortion? Yes\n\nIs that trade off worth while? I believe so and have itterated on this belief across hundreds and hundreds of projects cut and pressed to vinyl and then compared carefully with the original digital files",

This gets trickier with dynamics processing but that\u2019s a simple offset of the processed mix. That\u2019s all happening on the object in my DAW without need for additional plugins or routing.

For that reason I always start with finding the right limiter/style that keeps or changes the tonal balance the way I want (too bright mix = dark limiter, dull mix = bright limiter, great mix = limiter that keeps the balance when pushed ect.). Once I have the loudness and given the tonal balance a gentle push in the right direction with the limiter, I get the track over the finish line with eq or other tools in front of the limiter. \n\nThis is not meant as criticism of your approach, I just haven\u2019t cracked that code.\nHats of to you for making that work!",

Given the same GR and delicate harmonic content, the antialiased version will sound better, measure better, preserve transient details better and far more reliably prevent overshoots). \n\nNon oversampled limiters are strictly speaking aliasing machines with erratic overshoot control. A \"lofi\" special effects adding things that weren't there before.\n\nPut harmonic stuff into them and out comes inharmonic stuff. Sounds harder, faster and fresher. Not unlike a bit-crusher or SR decimator. In fact, the crusher or SR decimator will likely sound more controlled and offer more creative control over this valuable \"digitalitis\" than an aliased limiter.\n\nTry adding 12bit crusher or SR decimator to the signal, and then have a properly antialiased limiter do its job smoothly, and musically. Gives the best of both worlds: metallic \"spice\" plus smooth, harmonic and effective overshoot protection.\n\nNothing wrong exploiting and enjoying the sound of inharmonic distortion, it often works great at beefing up boring drums and percussions. The metallic sound of aliased non-linearities is a tool in itself. I love 12bit(ing) my drums for better freshness, for sharper transients. Just don't confuse it with better preservation of the original, it's a special effect irreversibly changing the signal. \"",

Was def freaked out about loosing gig , hence hitting the legend Ruairi.\n\n\"Do you think you would have approached using the ref any differently if you knew it was just some kid in a bedroom, or would you have still trusted that it was still the move to use it?\" - Man, this is such a good question. I have always fantasized about how cool it would be to sit down to work every day and have everything completely wiped so IDK what came from who - like have someone name everything \"A\" \"B\" and just work and then have them \"decode\" it to be the right artists that get their files, but I have no idea whos is whos while working. Obviously this is not realistic but certainly would be a cool experiment. Onto your question - probably so TBH. I might have had less reverence for his processing somewhere in my mind - but I would like to think that I would still have had the discernment to know that the mix was MONEY and that was the goal. I might have fussed with screenshots if the email chain was not stacked with heavy team members, ha, and it was only me and some dude on the thread.\n\nI hope some of this was helpful - learning and growing every day here - I love being wrong or misinformed - means growth.

This seems to my ears to not have the bad multiband smearing problems of say fabfilter mb, etc\n\nIn situations where the dynamics down there are out of whack and you need to control the groove better it can really work great, but that specific plugin has odd release characteristics that take time to understand. That same flexibility can allow some subtle control down there that can actually accentuate the groove and fix your problems at the same time.\n\nAs with everything, there are trade offs, it can make the low end sound odd if not careful, and you really need a room that is accurate down there to judge it well I think (now that I\u2019m in my current setup I can very clearly hear when it is helping or hurting)",

After producing, you\u2019ve heard the song so many times and it will be very easy to start second guessing.\n\nCLA said \u201ca mixer\u2019s greatest weapon is our fresh perspective\u201d. And it\u2019s probably the same for mastering engineers too. Switching modes takes practice, and it can\u2019t be done without practicing it at least in my experience. What helped me personally is mixing less while producing. Not putting too much time into processing individual elements unless I know exactly what I\u2019m doing next. I try not to troubleshoot and figure out why the mix isn\u2019t there yet because the arrangement isn\u2019t done yet. \n\nHow could I possibly make the drums work with vocals if the vocals aren\u2019t there yet?",

I used to have one \u00abdefault\u00bb limiter and focus all my moves in front of that, also adding limiter/loudness as the last step. When doing so, I always found myself having to tweak the moves (that I already had \u00abperfectly\u00bb dialed in) because everything would change when adding the final limiter. That\u2019s when I would be chasing my tail \ud83d\ude05\nNow I start with getting the limiter right for the song and then doing eq moves as the second step. This way it it a lot less back and forth for me. I should say I only use one limiter at the time and the limiters I audition with are dmg limitless, fabfilter pro-l2 and Ozone maximizer, with styles I know well. Dmg usually gets used on acoustic and jazz, pro-l2 & ozone for pop/rock. If it is music with vocals I find different styles can really change the way the vocals are percieved, so it\u2019s mostly chosing the style that support the vocals best that is the goal. Using two minuttes to get the right limiter from the start saves me time and uncertainty down the road, and in some cases let\u2019s me use less eq to get the desired result.\nThere are many roads to Rome as they say, I was just interested in yours bc whenever I tried that it ended in a lot of second guessing (for me!). \n\nDo you find yourself having to add more eq when adding limiter at the end to keep the tonal balance you have acheived?",

    "content": "Hey. There\u2019s nothing wrong with putting EQs and limiters on your master buss as you mix. A little bit of EQ or a lot of limiter is alright.\n\nThe answer here is to mix *into* your limiter. You don\u2019t want to mix the entire song and then slap a limiter on at the end for loudness. As you\u2019ve discovered that will mess up the balances that you\u2019ve spent so much time getting right. You want to ease the final limiting in as you\u2019re building the mix.\n\nI usually start a mix by pulling my limiter down a few dB. Enough to get everything starting to touch the limiter. To get the loudness in the ballpark.\n\nThen I\u2019ll push into it a little more so that I\u2019m starting to get some gain reduction. Certain instruments may begin to get pushed down or distorted in a way I don\u2019t like. Maybe the kick is hitting the limiter too hard, so I bring it\u2019s level down and then lower my limiter some more.\n\nContinue this process of adjusting balances into your limiter as you mix until you\u2019ve got the loudness where you want it. Usually I\u2019m checking in on my limiter a few times throughout the mix to see if I can push it harder without penalty. When I hear it distort in a way that I don\u2019t like I back off.\n\nHope that helps some.",

So you get closer to the danger zone, some distortion is well hidden by the signal and you're happy. If after that, you engage oversampling, it can add one or two dB of GR and those \"just hidden behind the signal artifacts\" become utterly obvious.\"",

Very much...listen and wait until I feel the pull to do something. And if not, I just don't. But even then, I do wild stuff because my heart likes it.

Because I wasn't there in the room, I don't know the limitations of the session. It's not helpful to try and impose my harmonic vocabulary or arrangement preferences on someone else's, and the sessions are never unmixable even when I don't think they come from an ideal starting point.

No. But it had something valuable to bring to the table.",

They may use a little eq, acceleration limiters or elliptical filters but they generally arent looking to change the basic sound, only make sure the head can cut it. The lathes collection of amps, the gear they have to accomplish this and the cutter head, the RIAA curve etc. will all heavily affect the sound, though that's probably obvious given that it's vinyl. The lathe amp/head combo can really make a pretty big difference. \nThe Neumann VMS70's and 80's sound totally different from a Scully/Westrex with tube amps for example.",

    "content": "Surely there's something to learn from the history though yes? Cutting is what the profession of mastering used to be and digital is not wholly removed. We can certainly take learnings from our history while embracing modern methods. Cutting good vinyl is also respect for the folks who work on it and the artists who want their music conveyed appropriately across mediums. \n\nI have no problem making stuff massively loud with zero limiting and small amounts of soft clipping, and still retaining tons of transient peaks. I prefer this sound to heavy limiting at the master stage where the program material audibly hits the limiter and the soundstage and sense of headroom collapses. To me, the limiter is optional, but I do understand many use it before they acquire the skills to work without it. \n\nThat said, I also was taught that in genres where its appropriate (Imagine Dragons, Hip hop, EDM, etc.) that those sounds should go in at the production or mixing stage. At the mastering stage I was taught to do no harm, and only to enhance what was present. In my work pushing more than a few dB into a limiter to affect the groove of a piece does not track with my understanding of doing as little to change the sound as possible. But of course, it all depends on the project. My clients who make very mainstream pop/youtube music don't particularly care if I radically editorialize as long as it sounds good and serves the tune. \n\nThere's also something to be said for music which needs to be quiet. Not all music should be loudenated to within an inch of its life. Not all music needs quiet and intimacy. I think of we hold the pursuit of \"the program material's individual requirements to be king\" we cannot then also dismiss vinyl as unimportant or say that one MUST always do things a particular way.",

Acceptance.\n\nIs it mastering if I only work from a stereo file? A limited REF? Tearing apart an mp3 bounce with AI and remaking it? An Ableton session? I say yes to all if we are the ones getting the record across the line. \n\nThat said, the traditional approach is IMO the best for many reasons, but in some sense just having a stereo file is an almost arbitrary restriction based on how projects are made and shared (though a good one). But as technology evolves and shifts, best to be on the cutting edge of knowing how to make a lot of situations work -- I bet the winners will be those who do",

I'd rather pay a mid level guy in my town that i can easily communicate with than do an online thing like that though.  I think when we did it, we never even got to find out the name of the engineer that did it. EDIT: As Cian said, sterling is also just uploading through an online portal and dealing with assistants, but, at least you know who is mastering it. They also generally only include one revision in the per song mastering rate at sterling, so its similar that way. If you dont have a label budget, it can be limiting if its not quite right the first time back, way less flexible than going with someone who might be able to acommodate a bit more back and forth when needed.",

I have been on both dies of the mastering thing, and I remember  getting masters back sometimes and thinking \"man they really phoned that one in, sounds just like my mix\" - now this opens up a whole nother convo about what mastering is or should be  - and its different project to project - but safe to say that  I was working with idiots back then, and I am willing to admit this mindset might be old school and not helpful to me anymore.\n\nI have played that mixer role before for some time, so maybe some left over trauma from that, but when I would send a song to get mastered - I wanted the ME to BEAT my mix. Not equal it or approve it, BEAT the shit out of it haha. So perhaps that causes me some mindset of \"I will do what they did but better\"  - and on a technical level I find that work is easier done from the non limited mix, personally.",

I\u2019m a Dunning Krueger case when it comes to DSP math, but from the surface amount that I\u2019ve drilled into it, it seems that there\u2019s at least a handful of different ways of adding samples to a signal and none of them are completely free of cost to the signal.

    "content": "So, in most cases, you can go over 0 dB in your DAW if you're working in 32-bit (or higher) precision, and you won\u2019t necessarily hear the clipping. This is because the internal audio engine can handle peaks above 0 without immediate distortion\u2014it\u2019s all about floating-point processing magic.\n\nNow, whether the audio gets normalized to stay under 0 dB depends on what happens during export. Sometimes, what you're seeing in the DAW or Ozone meters isn\u2019t exactly what ends up in the final file\u2014especially if there's a limiter, normalization, or post-processing involved. It\u2019s even possible that the version you\u2019re analyzing wasn\u2019t actually the one that was officially released. Happens more often than you\u2019d think!\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not unusual to see mixes or masters that are technically clipping more so going over 0... in tools like Ozone or the DAW but sound fine due to the flexibility of floating-point processing. I\u2019m not saying this is a best practice\u2014but I\u2019ve definitely played around with it. I\u2019ve even intentionally clipped files way past 0 dB, re-exported them, and compared them to cleaner versions. They sounded different, but at that point, I found myself asking, \u201cWhy am I trying to squeeze one more dB of loudness out of something that\u2019s already crushed and competitive?\u201d Classic overthinking, right?\n\nAnyway, back to your question: I think what you\u2019re seeing is a product of the DAW working internally at 32- or 64-bit, so it can handle those overs without clipping during processing. Then, during export, maybe they normalized it, maybe they fixed it later, maybe it did just didn't sound distroted haha... or maybe that\u2019s just not the real released version at all. Who knows?  I would not lose sleep over it and also know what you have seen is not a \"secret\" that your missing haha.",

I\u2019m generally happy with the results/loudness I get and comfortable with the parameters, except I never really mess with the \u201ccharacter\u201d which I suppose is the speed/release of the limiting? \n\nOn a recent mix I slowed it down more than I ever would, which really just means making it slower at all from the defaul setting, I usually stick very close to it, and I really like how it made the pocket of my mix feel. But I guess, I have always understood people to use very fast release compression on masterbusses.. \n\ndo you all find yourselves moving the character/release of the final limiter around pretty widely to get the right feel or are you typically keeping it quite fast?",

You can slow it down and get a cleaner sound ... and while you then lose a bit of volume you can then actually limit it more to make it back up. I notice when i move it to slow i lose about .2-.4 db in final level, so then I can gain it back up and take that \"off\" in the limiter. This might sound silly haha.. but it gets me the same \"loudness\" of the \"loud\" setting while being cleaner. Sometimes i just use loud though when it sounds right haha. this is not a perfect science but general observation and application haha.",

    "content": "I think time spent de-essing vocals and treating HF content in vinyl prepped masters overrides worrying about how much limiting there is in my opinion. The amount of limiting and how good/bad the cut is really pertinent on the program material itself.  Not the actual amount of gain reduction you are doing because the cutter will literally just turn everything down anywhere between 8-10dB before the signal hits the amps. Excessive sibilance, on a hyper compressed rock record with insane splashy over compressed cymbals and out of control HF information will result in the dull cuts you get back from most plants where you don\u2019t have access to the cutting engineer.  They do this because they want to create a playback safe record and avoid a very expensive $10k mistake like blowing a cutterhead if their amp breakers aren\u2019t calibrated right.  Instead of spot de-essing problem on one song or spot treating problem songs on a side, they will opt for broad stroke moves (HF limiting, EQ, global de-essing) and that can be a bit of death sentence to the quality of the cut and put everyone off vinyl as a format.  Which I think is an incredible format with well crafted engineering.  Also I strongly believe that every record doesn\u2019t belong on vinyl\u2026but that\u2019s another convo.",

If I need track-specific adjustments, I\u2019ll add plugins before the hardware chain. That way, each song is shaped to fit the chain I designed for the record. After the hardware, I will add plugins as well, typically something like limiting.\n\nIn the end, every song is tweaked individually. Often there are plugins for specific sections, along with level automation within the track. Once those adjustments are made, all songs then run through the hardware chain.\n\nI always print the hardware chain, so when revisions come up (making something a little louder or quieter, or adjusting a fade-in or fade-out) I don\u2019t need to recall the hardware.",

They think it's the fruity limiter, but FL producers have moved on from that because it sounds really bad, everyone uses the soft clipper and it's amazing for hiphop drums.)\nFor limiters I use a few, sometimes combinations (using multiple limiters spreads the workload a bit). I love the ozone vintage limiter, but I always use it in very small amounts, barely any gr. Fabfilter L2 is popular for a reason, can't really go wrong with that one imo. Waves L1 can work sometimes, but i rarely use it on a mixbus.

I'm still seeing some small overs, usually at 0db, but occasionally at 0.1 or 0.2\n\nIs this something I have to worry about? I suppose I yes, since intersample peaks (I think that's what these are) are obviously something you would want to avoid I think. What do you use as your final output or ceiling on your limiter?",

Basically Pro-L2 is my final stage, and if it\u2019s only grabbing a few dB on the ref mix, I might just send that off as is. Or if it\u2019s ended up more aggressive I\u2019ll pull it back and usually end up with it grabbing maybe ~3dB on loud drum hits, maybe more here and there. Essentially aiming to keep some of its effect on drum transients but leave the rest of the track alone. I\u2019ve gotten no complaints from mastering folks and it seems like many mixers are doing this (?)\u2026 When you get mixes like this (assuming they\u2019re good enough mixes), are you banging your head against the wall and significantly compromised in your work, or do you just get to work and master the record?",

I'm curious what is the rationale behind masters clipping output converters and leaving in true peaks that exceed 0dBFS? I get that clipping converters can sound cool / desirable, but why not achieve the clipping you want and then print a final master under zero? Why risk a consumer product crapping out during playback and adding potential distortion and why totally disregard pretty much every DSP's recommendation that true peaks not exceed -1 for the encoding process? I'm noticing that a ton of major label releases are peaking above zero with loudness normalization turned off on Spotify.",

Was just wondering if it could induce some sort of distortion somewhere along the line in the codecs. Using TP on a limiter is a different story.\n\nObviously very few clients will be \"checking\" this but I think it's my job to understand the trade-offs or if it matters at all when things go to streaming. Saw an IG live by Dale Becker and he seemed to imply that if there were TP in files they might get turned down more on streaming.

I'm curious about other's approaches and work flows for mastering albums specifically.\n\nI also have a more targeted question. I am wondering, in a world where most modern records take up all available headroom are relative track balance decisions (i.e. *I want the final chorus of track 3 to be the loudest perceived part of the entire album*) made at the input stage of the final limiter? Choosing less gain reduction via limiting or compression as well as distortion / saturation rather than turning a track down. Seems like a ratchet towards clipping, distortion, and lack of dynamic range and transient detail. Sure that's a whole can of worms but would be interested to discuss it. \ud83e\udd18",

Both approaches work but have different implications that have to be decided based on artistic intent.\n\nBut specifically for albums (and all mastering generally) working off intuition always works so much better for me. This also means you have to sort of practice outside of \u201cgame time\u201d so the tools flow when in the moment. Able to work quicker so you keep the entire project in mind. Mastering is a game of trade offs both in songs themselves and between them.\n\nAlso IMO \u201ccohesion\u201d is totally overrated in mastering albums. I never care (or even know, honestly) as a listener if song 8 sounds cohesive with song 1. I just care that the arc of the album moves me",

This may be \"normal\" but sometimes it's just not the move. Just did an album where one song wanted to be more compressed/limited. So we did that but just literally turned down the gain on the output so it fit better with another quieter (more dynamic, not output level) track before it to match the \"loudness\" of the two more closely.\n\nHard to give any other insight because so much of it is dependent on the actual songs you have, what the artist's vision is, how to serve that, etc. Dynamics/energy/loudness plays a big part in that!",

Hip Hop,Future Bass). I'll get the Attack time Right but again I get confused on how to go for setting the release time. Then I Usually Go by ear and hope that whatever I Did is not wrong for that perticular song\nAnd limiter is something I'm still confused about conceptually.\nAlthough I do set them in a way so that I don't lose the knock of my kicks and Groove and still maintain a healthy level but I still fail to understand what exactly is happening because what I know till now is the release settings in limiters behave differently then compressors so it's always confusing.\nSo I'm still get lost in this rabbit hole sometimes which makes me question my legitimacy\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering  right, ruari class finished ! .....ok so, ive a lot of thoughts ...this exercise has made a v big impression on me .\nOff top, \n\nAccording to RX The mix is at -7.2 LUFS integrated , -6.3 short term, TP -0.1\n\nThe artist wants a \"bit more low-end \" on a fast paced, alt/pop/rock track.\nAnd Imo a little air on top would compliment the mix.\n(starting at -7.2 is loud for my experience so its a good challenge and these sort of Lufs are what i want to become v comfortable working at where currently im more comfortable around -9.)\n\nSO i start with your 10 eq points in place , with your q settings and .5 db limits in fabfilter pro q 3  .\n\nThoughts:\n\nIt became clear immediately how powerful to me these q settings and eq points are, with regards to re-shaping the tonal balance.\nI cannot recall ever having only used these curves , nor in the absence of any other processing. \nListening to the impact of 0.1 db up or down in the different areas was remarkable. \n\nAfter half an hour id got to something i was v happy with, that appeared \"Louder \" to me and also.....a bit more lows and a little more open on top. Which id call a success.\n\nId brought the Pro q output down 0.4db to compensate the gain increase and printed with no limiter.\n\nIn RX this printed version showed as -7.2 LUFS integrated , -6.3 short term, TP 0.0 .\n\nIdeally id have not touched this again.....i really liked it. \n\nFollowing instructions i then put the L2 Limiter on (modern mode , +0.1 db, TP on and output -0.1) .\n\nTruth be told, once id put the limiter on i wanted to go back into the EQ because i didnt like the sound anymore, i felt the L2 spoilt it.",

And many people have lots of different takes on this. \n\nBut my advice is to not even worry about the concept of mastering at this point in their musical journey and just make the best music they can, and put as much effort into it as humanly possible to make it sound to the best of their ability. And then slap a limiter on it to get it as loud as they can get it before it starts sounding worse. Make mix changes based on what they don\u2019t like when testing it on different systems. \n\nAnd while it might not sounds like a the weeknd record mastered by sing, it should still be able to be somewhat competitive to other people at the same level. \n\nReps will teach them something new every time. And finding a mentor will also do the same. If they can an attended mastering session with someone who does great work, it could give some great insight about the possibilities and function of what mastering actually does. \n\nThis might be a bit of a hot take, but if a track sounds very far from release ready before mastering, it\u2019s probably not ready to be mastered yet.",

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering  hi ruairi so I\u2019m on my third listen to \u201ctunnel under ocean boulevard \u201c and have been really enjoying it . It\u2019s got a vibe of  a david lynch movie about a singer who is the love child of dusty Springfield and Elvis who grew up with Kate bush on tour with Tom waits and roger waters . Anyhoo I digress ! If I may ask as much as poss without asking you to divulge anything compromising about the process : I am fascinated by a few things and wonder what your approach was . In many parts this work feels almost like a  poetry with orchestration and I think has extended parts with little or quite subtle drum parts . I wonder with something like this how do you judge how hard (or not ) to push the overall level (both individual tracks and all together ) as for me I think I tend to judge off what the drums / bass dictates w/regard to level . In this case where drums and bass aren\u2019t really dominating , I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be as confident in knowing what is the right level . After all there are periods of soft vocal and very gentle lush strings \u2026..these sorts of passages I might get a bit unsure In . I also wondered did you stay in the box for this one ? \u2026.and was this a project for mostly eq more than comp/limiting ? The sound of the record is v expensive and classic imo , do you treat a record like this completely differently with regards to what processes you might use on a different genre (again ITB vs analogue chains ) . Also , I wondered how long did you have to master this ? I\u2019m v interested by engineers abilities not just to perform but to perform to deadlines . It seems this record could go badly wrong if the right choices aren\u2019t made (where a clipped crushed mix could be more forgiving) I wonder how much time you get to review the moves you make on a project like this and if/when you don\u2019t have much time \u2026.do you ever play it safe ?/ make less bold moves in the absence of time to review them ?",

Some of the clipping applications I like for push                    \n\nIn Mixing. \nKazrog KClip to dirty up the mix bus when wanted. \nBoz Big Clipper is great for a Kick/Bass Bus , with a transient shaper \nIK Multimedias Classic Clipper is nice on a clap/sn. \nEvent Horison / Standard Clip sound nice on a drum bus to me . I\u2019d recommend listening to all of these and listening for differences. \nStandard Clip (no oversampling) before an L2 in mastering \nAll my clipping is just catching peaks pre comp/limiter \n\nI think the trouble with the baphomet cpz strategy is they are mixing very atonal...Noise. So those serum type sounds ....you could clip the hell out of them and it makes no difference, theres not much low end in the \u201cbass sounds\u201d being used either. Imo. I find dan Wirral\u2019s videos  demonstrate investigations of contemporary techniques.....with music , that actually isn\u2019t very contemporary.....theres a new kid on the YT block, Sseb....him and the discord\u2019s own George t are pretty much the only music tech channels apart from lwmr i fw \n\nSomeone doing some intriguing stuff imo with seemingly mad amounts of clipping, expansion and limiting  is Luca pretolesi imo. From time to time some of his mix academy stuff pops up on line and he demonstrates what\u2019s he\u2019s up to lately....and it all looks so extreme and heavy handed....but then in the end, I\u2019ve gotta say.....for the genres he\u2019s demonstrating ....it sounds lively and pretty effective at the end of his process.\n\nMaybe have a look at what he\u2019s doing, if you\u2019d like to see an alternative to baphomet and the tear out CTZ noise game.",

I'm just trying to understand why limiters seem to fall apart so quickly specifically w/pianos.)",

I have lots of time for serving the client and the project, being a team player and getting things across the line.. but that\u2019s usually the reality of the business... not what\u2019s best for the Sonics. I think vinyl has the opportunity to sound amazing but modern mixing AND mastering techniques are often getting in the way of that.",

    "content": "Okay crew got a question on a scenario I\u2019ve come upon often enough to ask:\n\nA limited REF is given at 24 bit \u2014 but when the non-lim mix is given in 24bit it\u2019s peaking at exactly 0.0db. \n\nObviously there could be many explanations for this (if intentional, which is fine). But I\u2019ve had it happen quite a few times where I have a close relationship with a mixer and thought it could be an oversight for reasons specific to each instance (not just generally seeing a peak of 0)\u2014 turns out when the non-lim 32 bit print is sent there are sure enough overs in there.\n\nTypically i see it happen when they are going into limiters hot in the REF, obviously when they print non-lim there are overs. Talking big overs, +4db or whatever\n\nBUT \u2014 honestly it doesn\u2019t really sound \u201cclipped\u201d in the 24bit non-lim print \u2014 I\u2019m assuming the overs are just recalibrated to zero but somehow this doesn\u2019t sound bad? Of course, if I get the 32bit I find I can make it sound just as loud but \u201cbetter\u201d with the full waveform represented in the 32bit file.\n\nIt\u2019s an easy fix \u2014 just get a 32 bit print without a limiter (if I can get in touch with who is handling that, which isn\u2019t always the case).\n\nI think (?) I understand what\u2019s happening \u2014 DAWs operate at 64 or 32 and can handle the overs fine in the session, but upon render at 24bit they get chopped (not sure about wording).\n\nTotally fine \u2014 I can and have handled it no problem, just a curiosity on what others are seeing, if I\u2019m even on the mark about this and how (or if) you are handling it.",

I thought maybe they knew something I didn\u2019t.\n\nSo I tried it. I put a gain plugin before my limiter and pushed the limiter with it. The results? It sounds awful. All the punch and width is gone. Change back to using the limiter\u2019s threshold, sounds great.\n\nAny technical reason for this? I was using the Kilohearts Gain plugin in to Ozone Maximizer, but I would be hard pressed if it was one of those plugins at fault. Maybe the threshold of the limiter has an internal signal flow that changes its behavior as opposed to gain coming in to it or something? Maybe this workflow makes better sense in Sequoia for the Sterling engineers for some reason?",

Two songs ago he got onto experimenting with AI mastering which he thankfully moved off of because the tracks sounded horrible. \nThis last track we did, he had another ME offer to do a test master on it. I was down and just asked if I could hear it before it goes out. Fast forward, he uploads the track and the first time I hear about it was through socials. So I asked if he went with that ME and how it sounded and got told no, his drummer mate ended up mastering the track. \nSo I just got quite frustrated as him and I have quite an open relationship. Mainly because it didn\u2019t sound that great. There was a bunch of true peak overs which thankfully I\u2019m less stressed about after speaking to Jack\nSo I\u2019m struggling to see if this is ego or just that I don\u2019t trust this person who mastered the track.",

My approach was to build that density up from scratch, but to keep the 2bus streamlined. Set the vocal at the absolute level it needed to be and built rest of mix around that. 2 bus = Ozone maximizer doing -2.8 db. SO chuffed, everyone super happy.

(Basically every snare hit) Properly painted myself into a corner\u2026Ive got 1 db at most to turn down before artist becomes bummed. True peak limiting =really kills the vibe.

    "content": "Alright I'm back with another question for the hive mind:\n\nFinishing up an EP today we've been slow-dripping for awhile. First song we did had big drums, tons of low, measures louder (-8.4 LUFS). Mastered and approved before the rest of them came this way. Rest of the songs are sparse, open, beautiful. But accordingly meausre much lower (loudest is -11 LUFS). \n\nSo with the new info Dale posted the other day re: how Spotify is normalizing levels, I thought let's just turn down the louder one a little to see how it fits (it's fine), maybe that can buy us a db or whatever for the other songs when they normalize to the loudest song as long as the creative intent is preserved (it is). And that's cool. But actually a better result IMO was to just ease up on the loudness of the first song (at -8.4 LUFS), it makes more sense in the project being a bit more dynamic rather than having the dense one be pulled down.\n\nQuestion is: will this cause the single version to be replaced by the new album one when going to distro?\n\nI've had masters that we replaced before with a lowered ceiling in projects and all was fine, but the actual master was exactly the same minus the ceiling, so in a single context it would normalize the same. I know to keep exact length to ms, etc etc. \n\nBut the new info Dale posted makes me rethink how to handle this in albums (on Spotify -- on Apple is doesn't seem to be doing that?)",

About a year ago I noticed that a label I work with was submitting my non-ADM files to Apple as ADM and still getting certified. I asked the label to use the ADM files in the future as I didnt want to risk my accreditation. They responded that nothing had been flagged by distribution nor by Apple but they would do so moving forward.\n\nFlash forward to this year - I noticed that some ADM files from other engineers had overs, not just clipping but significant overs, check the newest Olivia Rodrigo album. According to the aforementioned document, definitely not to spec hahah.\n\nFlash forward from there to about a month ago, I submitted my standard formats to another label I work with including standard streaming WAV as well as an ADM file. Through chatting with their distribution team it came to light that at the distro end of things they could only upload 1 file (the ADM) and this file would be delivered to each DSP in the specs they can receive, which I found very interesting since the ADM file is occasionally different than the other streaming WAVs.",

    "content": "Could be several different things, right? Sometimes it's a gap too far to bridge in the moment- I'd love some upper extensions on the harmony but the artist only thinks in triads. Sometimes it's a technical limitation- the rough mix is a mess but I know the producer's assembling the track on Focal Alphas in an untreated room. Sometimes it's a budget limitation or label politics that I'll never know about. Sometimes (often) different people just think about music differently. Sometimes (often) it's none of my business, and I should focus my energy on my part of the job.\n\nAlso try to have enough self-awareness to remember that I surely have my own analogous blind spots.\n\nAnd also 110% believe in empowering one's collaborators, helping people learn and make progress. I just don't think in-the-moment critiques are a helpful part of that.",

If either are working too hard it tells me I need to go back to the mix and fix.  \n\nI\u2019ll do as you suggested and see what I get back, interested to see how a couple of different versions sound. Thanks again!",

The brickwall limiter always sounds crunchy to me when pushing more than a dB with different lookahead times release times etc. Doesn't even come close to my favs Pro L2 and Ozone Maximiser.

    "content": "Hi everyone! Today I thought I\u2019d write here to ask how you approach mastering an album that you've mixed yourself. Sometimes I work on albums where the mixes are done in a very short time, and other times it takes longer, so the focus changes over time (which is totally natural). Right now, what I\u2019m doing is setting up a mastering session with all the latest mixes (with limiting applied), doing the track list, and listening to the differences between them\u2014things like timbre, balance, loudness, etc. I make notes of what I hear, then go back to the mix sessions to make small tweaks. After that, I export everything without the final clipping/limiting on the tracks, so I can apply those in the final mastering session and then master the album. Anyone with a different approach is more than welcome to share, as right now I\u2019m wrapping up a lot of albums I\u2019ve worked on throughout the year, and I want to stay as sharp as possible to give them a proper finish.",

There are of course lots of nitty gritty things to get the most out of a record, but the cutting engineer can worry about that, any Kentucky windage on your part will probably just make it sound worse. \n\nFwiw, he also mentioned that for every dB of limiting you can expect a dB or more lower on the cut, so that noise floor will start to get annoying. They can actually cut the unlimited stuff quite a bit louder, so unless you need that limiter for the sound, maybe consider ditching it or at least hitting it less.",

When the limiter is used conservatively, it will not deteriorate the sharp transients, and the upward expander can do its job of making the upward-going dynamics more exciting. Prove it by bypassing the limiter at matched compare levels and see if it's hurting the sound of the music. If it is, and you cannot live with the degradation, the only solution is to master at a lower level. \"",

The digital and cutting engineer were working closely together. \n\nNow, a lot of these artists were not making music that required massive amounts of limiting to sound the way they do. \n\nThat said, I disagree. Vinyl is already changing the sound so radically that if sonic faithfulness to the digital master is required - why make vinyl? A record will NEVER sound like the digital original or even the tape master for that matter. No two lathes sound anything alike, and the differences can be astonishing. I have heard a lathe amp turn a wretched sounding track into a brilliant one. And vice versa. Vinyl is an unfaithful medium. If you don't care about the cut's sound that's fine. Submit whatever is submitted for the digital master and let the pressing house sort it out. Why even bother with a proper 3rd party cutting engineer at that point?",

A good friend of mine is one of the top Lathe techs in North America, and my understanding from him and the cutting engineers I know and have worked with, is that digital clipping can make life hard for lathes. I'm not saying you cannot do it or arguing the merits of digital limiting or anything like that, that's an entirely separate topic. It is however a technical fact that lathes do not get along well with digital clipping and it will make the cutting engineers job harder and generally result in a record which does not sound as dynamic.

Delta plugins can be very beneficial- this goes for clipping and de essing also. Listen to the \u2018delta\u2019 (can be annoying and not so great for your hearing so don\u2019t do it a long time) and get your distortion in rhythm with the record. I guess the best way to describe that is when you get that sort of wobble where you can\u2019t hear everything (duh you\u2019re hearing only the added distortion) but the gaps fill in in your mind and you can follow the timing- then you\u2019ll be happy with the result plus the trade offs induced.",

If you heard the music you would have NEVER guessed this twist in the story. \n@hebakadry is correct that highs are a bigger deal. I guess the point is every project has unique characteristics that require the person cutting it to sometimes make decisions that blur technical and artistic ones together. This is partly why I have a policy of cutting only masters I\u2019ve done. I feel I have the liberty of eq\u2019ing some more at cutting time. \nSo as far as the comments go, nobody is totally wrong - it\u2019s simply very situation dependent.

Finally I used to stack limiters like crazy because it sounded more musical and natural to me. Now its on a song by song case but thanx to all the info here I find myself liking using one limiter with a clipper before it. Bear in mind though that I master exclusively for indie artists that deliver really low mixes and want me to pump them up significantly which is a challenge doing only with one limiter. What are you thoughts lovely people on this matter? Like you get a mix that is on average at -20 to -16 LUFS and they want it to to sound as loud as billboard top 100 tracks \ud83d\ude02",

Sometimes I need to really limit like 5-6dB of gain reduction and that scares me a lot! At the moment I find that clipping a bit more aggressively before the limiter makes for a cleaner more musical result for the majority of the time rather than relying heavily on the limiter. The music feels more connected. So far I find the Pro L2 in All Round mode being the most transparent limiter followed by the balanced mode in ozone maximiser but as always depends on the song.

Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively). a dB or two of clipping will help the limiter work less.\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

    "content": "My last update on this - How the first go went.\n\nI ended up tweaking things throughout the sesh, and kept a lot of what was said here in mind as I navigated settings and mindsets.\n\nThese plugins will all be in a template inactive, but it helps me account for a lot of possible scenarios I could come across and how I'd approach it.\n\nHere are the strokes I ended up doing for this test:\n\n1. I did end up using RX and Soothe for this, since the test was a one take with many flaws.\n2. MB did heavy lifting for control\n3. I did a smiley face EQ on it and it felt appropriate, but also because of the lack of mixing on the raw one-take. \n4. ShadowHills 0.5-1.5dB on optical and discrete rebalanced at different levels felt like it added a sense of dimension that wasn't there.\n5. Studer - Added, but again keeping in mind that it added characteristics I need to be careful putting onto a refined mix. This gave it some harmonic life it was missing.\n6. Pro-DS - made some horrendous high end sound more bearable.\n7. Pro-Q3 - some last lil notches for problem frequencies, especially up high and unpleasant.\n8. Oxford Limiter - barely dancing thresh, slower attack, fast rls, inflator 42%, cus I'm spicy.\n\n-\n\nIf anyone reads this and has comments or statements about any of this, please let me know if you'd like to give thoughts here, or if you'd like me to send you the before and after to gauge my decisions relative to your taste, based on the decisions I made for this file.",
