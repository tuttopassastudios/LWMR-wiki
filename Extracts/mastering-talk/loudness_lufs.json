In a follow up to this, as a wonderful surprise, had my master picked in a shootout against an engineer who is leagues ahead of me.\n\nMy master was 1.6db quieter, and the artist actually liked the space it gave (it is still plenty plenty loud). Just was interesting that this artist had the understanding of really what they wanted, how it mattered to his art, etc.\n\nOther guys master sounded great too, just really hot and dense dense. which I feel 9 times out of 10 will win because explaining the trade offs and benefits of loudness (and having it understood) is very hard, but this felt like an artist really leading with their vision, not concern with the loudness stuff\u2026how he articulated it to me confirmed that. Pretty cool, regardless of outcome",

Every service works differently. One cannot confidently shoot at a target that doesn\u2019t really exist. So, just master the material for the material.\n2. Not every user has normalization turned on. Thus, the material will be arbitrarily quiet next to other material that isn\u2019t mastered to the target. So, just master the material for the material.\n3. Not everybody consumes through streaming. Outside of a platform, the material needs to stand on its own. So, just master the material for the material.\n4. Lots of modern music benefits sonically from being pushed into a limiter. Mastering below that short changes the material. So, just master the material for the material.",

    "content": "@hebakadry  taught my dumb ass over many years of patience that loudness is built in the mix which really shook up my workflow 8-10 years ago... that being said, after many years of working together we've recently collaborated on a few projects where I intentionally didn't take it easy on the mix bus but still encouraged her to push it further and get as creative & collaborative with the master as she wanted to. It's resulted in some of my favorite sounding records I've ever been a part of. She respected the mix, but took chances and didn't just hand me back my mix. Out the door they were some of my favorite mixes I've ever done and Heba brought something else to them that I couldn't or wouldn't have thought to. I trust her taste & I asked for her imprint. I think there's a way to do both... you can 100% encourage a mastering engineer to push things further and forward without undercooking a mix... but it definitely requires an alignment of taste and trust.",

My advice is to make one digital master that sounds good, is not overly crushed for loudness, and use it for everything. Let the various streaming sites normalize it as they wish. It will still sound just as good. Normalization does no harm to the audio - it's merely a playback volume setting.",

    "content": "Story time - I was asked to master a song that is above my paygrade, I was  super stoked to land the gig. I got the limited ref and the unlimited mix, and went to town doing \u201cmy thing\u201d as usual. After some time I went for the A/B - and the ref was BLOWING my shit out of the water. To provide a little context, I have been mastering seriously for 6 years, and in the least ego driven way possible, usually always \u201cmy thing\u201d beats whatever limited ref I am up against. I have not been in many scenarios where I can\u2019t beat the ref. With this song that was not the case at all. On the advice shared here previously, I got in touch with the mixer and asked what was going on with his loudness chain. \n\nDudes, it was so much. Two BOZ clippers, a gullfoss, stacked limiters - the works. However - the limited ref was dripping in vibe. The mixer bullseye\u2019d this song. It was totally ON POINT and my chain was getting nowhere close. I considered going the route of screenshots and recreate the mixers madness step by step - but TBH - I did not want to drag the project through all that especially with me being brought on as a new ME to an already established team that is above my paygrade, and my ears and heart knew that the limited ref was right on the money anyway.\n\nI needed a vote of confidence , so I asked a close friend (cough @Nomograph Mastering ) who is ahead of me in this game if it was acceptable for me to work from the limited ref. (showing my greenness here). A great word of advice came through - \u201cThe only rule is what gives the best final outcome.\u201d - I made the call to work from the ref. The final chain was so simple - standard clip, equilibrium, limitless. 3 moves. Nothing going crazy. Got an over the top enthusiastic approval this morning, and am so freakin stoked about the whole thing, will probably get the whole project.",

The dynamics, combined with the *type of low frequency* content of those genres at that time, along with DJ\u2019s who knew what the fuck they were doing, along with sound crews who worked the rave circuit and were continually hired and worked with the same DJ\u2019s, all contributed so much to this magic rave Vinyl era.\nThere\u2019s nothing that touched those deep kickass lows back then, But That was the style! \nSo much has changed.

    "content": "Below I am sharing something that I send to my mastering clients when they inquire about targeting LUFS levels for streaming services. I hope it is helpful to some readers. Discussion is welcome.\n\n\nRegarding mastering to streaming LUFS loudness normalization targets, i.e. -14 LUFS - I do not recommend trying to do that. I know it's discussed all over the web, but in reality very few people actually do it. To test this, try turning loudness matching off in Spotify settings, then check out the tracks listed under \"New Releases\" and see if you can find material that's not mastered to modern loudness for it's genre. You will probably find little to none. Here's why people aren't doing it:\n\n1 - In the real world, loudness normalization is not always engaged. For example, Spotify Web Player and Spotify apps integrated into third-party devices (such as speakers and TVs) do not have loudness normalization. YouTube is normalized but \"YouTube Music\" is not normalized. Apple Music's web player is not normalized. With normalization off, your -14 LUFS track will sound much softer than most other tracks.\n\n2- Even with loudness normalization turned on, many people have reported that their -14 LUFS masters sound quieter than other tracks in playlists.\n\n3 - Some streaming services have different loudness targets (Apple's is -16) and there's no guarantee they won't change their loudness targets again in the future. For example, Spotify lowered their loudness target by 3dB in 2017, then in 2021 they switched measurement from ReplayGain to LUFS. Also, in Spotify Premium app settings you find 3 different loudness settings; \"Quiet, Normal, and Loud\". Now AES is recommending that all music streaming services switch to -16 LUFS. It's a moving target. \n\n4 - Some people suggest making multiple masters at different levels. But digital aggregators (CD Baby, etc.) generally do not allow more than one version of each song, so you'd have to make separate paid submissions.",

    "content": "Just for reference, the convo was to restrict my approach to one band of EQ, Q of no sharper than .7 and maybe a low shelf. That's it. And a limiter.\n\nSince then I've done at least over 100 songs, many of which are out in the world and/or on their way to release. So a decent time to circle back with some insight. However, compared to more experienced ears on here I am still a baby.\n\nExtremely powerful challenge from Ruairi, and it really made me think in broad terms about what EQ is doing, what my goals are when using it, and how each part relates to another. And what you gain or lose when making a move. I would highly recommend it, and found it very very hard. It's non-trivial to make things sound better when you actually hear what's happening.\n\n I've also been pretty lucky to work on quite a bit of music that I would have considered outside of my experience range, and I think this gentler approach worked well there because the mixes were already pretty damn good. So there's that too!\n\nOf course for work where I'm being paid I'm not only restricting to one band, I do whatever is needed but even so many times I would prefer that. It felt like \"learning scales\" but for mastering in a way. And loudness really is down mostly to EQ, as far as I can tell!",

There's a sort of \"center of gravity\" for the frequency of instruments. Individual instruments did not need as much low end as I once thought. I realized that I could push more energy up into the mids and upper-mids. Instruments could be leaner and biting. Much more than I thought tolerable. This has a few positive effects:\n\n1. The sounds will cut more and be articulate in the mix (if desired).\n\n2. Low-end buildup is the first thing that's going to hit your limiter. Shifting the energy up the frequency spectrum buys you more space before your limiter kicks in. Thus your overall mix can be louder.\n\n3. Your low-end instruments will no longer compete to feel powerful. Therefore they do not need to be as loud in an absolute/voltage sense. Meanwhile, your midrange-y instruments that were once lean and bite-y in isolation are supplemented by your low-end instruments and feel whole again.",

    "content": "@Rollmottle already gave a great answer here. I want to re-state and co-sign what he posted \n\n1. Don't try and remove what you can't hear. Never going to end well. There is no general rule sub 30hz so don't try and preemptively deal with something if you're not even sure it's an issue\n2. If you do need to deal with a low end issue, deal with it at the source, instead of the 2-mix if you can\n3. If you're dealing with it at the 2-mix level, gentle shelves will do less harm than steep cuts\n\nOk. Now to a thornier aspect of your question - does throwing away super low end information help us with loudness?\n\nAs I\u2019ve said many times here our typical goal is not just maximum loudness. The goal is really high perceived loudness, and low measured loudness (to avoid being turned down too much by normalization), all while remaining musical and true to the intent of the song\n\nPerceived loudness is primarily driven by arrangement (less elements better), distortion (more distortion makes things feel louder but at obvious cost) and frequency content (special attention needs to be paid to the 1500 to 6000 region I mentioned the other day). Super low end content doesn\u2019t have too much of a direct effect on how we perceive loudness but of course it does have second order effects - huge lows will cause limiters to overwork and we\u2019ll get into trouble with things sounding smashed sooner than we\u2019d like\n\nOk, but what of measured loudness? Here it pays to have an understanding of how LUFS are actually calculated. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a neat summary video somewhere Dan Worrall style, if so please link it in folks. The definitive doc on LUFS measurement is here \n\nhttps://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-5-202311-I!!PDF-E.pdf",

Then go to the loudest part of the song and quickly audition maximizer vs. vintage lim vs. Pro-L2 to get things to hit ~-9 LUFS on my Clarity M loudness radar (really great visualization for quickly doing this). Then I just get to work on the mix. Things often end up getting louder throughout the process and I'm OK with that. I'm often going back and checking to make sure things aren't overcooked. I should change my language from 'set it and forget it' to 'set it, forget it, but go back and check every now end then'.",

This is an email that Nomogrpah wrote back to a client that said \"Hey I love the master so much but I am a bit worried about how much it might get turned down ?\" or something to that effect \n\nResponse was \n\n\"Glad you are feeling the master!\n\nRe the level thing that is a complicated question. A few thoughts\n\nNot everyone has loudness normalization turned on. It also doesn\u2019t exist on Smart TVs, many streaming web interfaces etc\n\nThe different services all have different level norm targets (and even different settings within just Spotify) - and they change pretty regularly\n\nIn terms of absolute level when normalization is active what matters is arrangement (dense mixes sound quieter than sparse/spacious mixes), EQ (bright/mid range forward mixes sound louder than dark) and distortion levels (clipped/distorted mixes feel perceptually louder than clean). If I make a master a dB louder in mastering using just limiting for example, they just turn it down a dB more when it\u2019s level normed.\n\nSo what does all of this mean? It means that every song has sweet spot where the EQ/tone, the arrangement and the overall clipping/limiting level works best and communicates the intent. That\u2019s what we aim for.\n\nYou can use a site like loudnesspenalty.com to see what will happen but it will just drive you crazy and the only real way to meaningfully alter the result is to change the arrangement/mix or overall EQ a lot. On release day you can find 1000 records that are louder than yours if you want to.\n\nIf being the loudest is the intent - game everything listed above and you can \u201cwin\u201d. If doing your unique thing and communicating a song and a performance is the goal then I think you are there!\"\n\n(posted with Nomographs permission)",

This is best for lossy formats (Ogg/Vorbis and AAC) and makes sure no extra distortion\u2019s introduced in the transcoding process.\nIf your master\u2019s louder than -14dB integrated LUFS, make sure it stays below -2dB TP (True Peak) to avoid extra distortion.

There\u2019s a whole school of the online mastering discourse that holds this belief and it strikes me as disconnected from the mainstream. It presupposes that loudness comes at significant cost to the material in some way \u2014 which way? Emotional? technical? artistic?  Or that all material should be dynamic\u2026which is, of course, not true. \n\nAs Noah was getting at, some of my most vivid memories of live music both as a performer and as an audience member exist BECAUSE they were loud as fuck. Loud is in our DNA. There\u2019s a visceral, tactile and emotional response to loud. Even if we\u2019re talking about a \u201cquiet\u201d or more dynamic record, people will turn it up so they can feel it.\n\nGood loud is within everybody\u2019s grasp in 2025 and I love being able to make loud records louder, with minimal, if any, trade off. If I can deliver an appropriately loud master given the material with little compromise, I will. That\u2019s exciting to me and not a bummer. It's what the vast majority of my clients are looking for. Of course if the record doesn\u2019t call for loud, we don\u2019t make it loud. But, I also don\u2019t think excessive loudness is what\u2019s making or breaking records.",

For that reason I always start with finding the right limiter/style that keeps or changes the tonal balance the way I want (too bright mix = dark limiter, dull mix = bright limiter, great mix = limiter that keeps the balance when pushed ect.). Once I have the loudness and given the tonal balance a gentle push in the right direction with the limiter, I get the track over the finish line with eq or other tools in front of the limiter. \n\nThis is not meant as criticism of your approach, I just haven\u2019t cracked that code.\nHats of to you for making that work!",

Some records would have been better if people exercised restraint with how hard they push loudness. You can overcook loudness and you can undercook it as well.\n\nAs with so many things, the optimal solution is context dependent and somewhere in the middle. Neither too loud nor too quiet.

    "content": "That makes sense, thanks for the explanation. Reading this, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re miles appart. I used to have one \u00abdefault\u00bb limiter and focus all my moves in front of that, also adding limiter/loudness as the last step. When doing so, I always found myself having to tweak the moves (that I already had \u00abperfectly\u00bb dialed in) because everything would change when adding the final limiter. That\u2019s when I would be chasing my tail \ud83d\ude05\nNow I start with getting the limiter right for the song and then doing eq moves as the second step. This way it it a lot less back and forth for me. I should say I only use one limiter at the time and the limiters I audition with are dmg limitless, fabfilter pro-l2 and Ozone maximizer, with styles I know well. Dmg usually gets used on acoustic and jazz, pro-l2 & ozone for pop/rock. If it is music with vocals I find different styles can really change the way the vocals are percieved, so it\u2019s mostly chosing the style that support the vocals best that is the goal. Using two minuttes to get the right limiter from the start saves me time and uncertainty down the road, and in some cases let\u2019s me use less eq to get the desired result.\nThere are many roads to Rome as they say, I was just interested in yours bc whenever I tried that it ended in a lot of second guessing (for me!). \n\nDo you find yourself having to add more eq when adding limiter at the end to keep the tonal balance you have acheived?",

    "content": "Hey. There\u2019s nothing wrong with putting EQs and limiters on your master buss as you mix. A little bit of EQ or a lot of limiter is alright.\n\nThe answer here is to mix *into* your limiter. You don\u2019t want to mix the entire song and then slap a limiter on at the end for loudness. As you\u2019ve discovered that will mess up the balances that you\u2019ve spent so much time getting right. You want to ease the final limiting in as you\u2019re building the mix.\n\nI usually start a mix by pulling my limiter down a few dB. Enough to get everything starting to touch the limiter. To get the loudness in the ballpark.\n\nThen I\u2019ll push into it a little more so that I\u2019m starting to get some gain reduction. Certain instruments may begin to get pushed down or distorted in a way I don\u2019t like. Maybe the kick is hitting the limiter too hard, so I bring it\u2019s level down and then lower my limiter some more.\n\nContinue this process of adjusting balances into your limiter as you mix until you\u2019ve got the loudness where you want it. Usually I\u2019m checking in on my limiter a few times throughout the mix to see if I can push it harder without penalty. When I hear it distort in a way that I don\u2019t like I back off.\n\nHope that helps some.",

(No prejudice meant against the software for other potential users ) . So far this dsm seems more suited to my sonics \u2026.my question however is re the release time . I find the release times I usually dial in are not appreciated by this plug ,  in your experience is the release time for the dsm equivalent to what you\u2019d be setting in an l2 etc \u2026.or is there a bit of a nack to this dsm and it has its own wants and needs . I seem to be getting a sort of ringing / distortion at faster times ? Any tips / advice would be appreciated muchos , have a great day",

It's also when I began to work with less heavy-handed mastering engineers who were more likely to maintain the level of the mix that I sent them. I go back and listen to some stuff now and I think there'd be real merit in pushing things against the glass a little more.",

    "content": "So, in most cases, you can go over 0 dB in your DAW if you're working in 32-bit (or higher) precision, and you won\u2019t necessarily hear the clipping. This is because the internal audio engine can handle peaks above 0 without immediate distortion\u2014it\u2019s all about floating-point processing magic.\n\nNow, whether the audio gets normalized to stay under 0 dB depends on what happens during export. Sometimes, what you're seeing in the DAW or Ozone meters isn\u2019t exactly what ends up in the final file\u2014especially if there's a limiter, normalization, or post-processing involved. It\u2019s even possible that the version you\u2019re analyzing wasn\u2019t actually the one that was officially released. Happens more often than you\u2019d think!\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not unusual to see mixes or masters that are technically clipping more so going over 0... in tools like Ozone or the DAW but sound fine due to the flexibility of floating-point processing. I\u2019m not saying this is a best practice\u2014but I\u2019ve definitely played around with it. I\u2019ve even intentionally clipped files way past 0 dB, re-exported them, and compared them to cleaner versions. They sounded different, but at that point, I found myself asking, \u201cWhy am I trying to squeeze one more dB of loudness out of something that\u2019s already crushed and competitive?\u201d Classic overthinking, right?\n\nAnyway, back to your question: I think what you\u2019re seeing is a product of the DAW working internally at 32- or 64-bit, so it can handle those overs without clipping during processing. Then, during export, maybe they normalized it, maybe they fixed it later, maybe it did just didn't sound distroted haha... or maybe that\u2019s just not the real released version at all. Who knows?  I would not lose sleep over it and also know what you have seen is not a \"secret\" that your missing haha.",

I\u2019m generally happy with the results/loudness I get and comfortable with the parameters, except I never really mess with the \u201ccharacter\u201d which I suppose is the speed/release of the limiting? \n\nOn a recent mix I slowed it down more than I ever would, which really just means making it slower at all from the defaul setting, I usually stick very close to it, and I really like how it made the pocket of my mix feel. But I guess, I have always understood people to use very fast release compression on masterbusses.. \n\ndo you all find yourselves moving the character/release of the final limiter around pretty widely to get the right feel or are you typically keeping it quite fast?",

You can slow it down and get a cleaner sound ... and while you then lose a bit of volume you can then actually limit it more to make it back up. I notice when i move it to slow i lose about .2-.4 db in final level, so then I can gain it back up and take that \"off\" in the limiter. This might sound silly haha.. but it gets me the same \"loudness\" of the \"loud\" setting while being cleaner. Sometimes i just use loud though when it sounds right haha. this is not a perfect science but general observation and application haha.",

    "content": "Folks, I have a question for the group. Would love to get a mastering engineers perspective. I'm curious what is the rationale behind masters clipping output converters and leaving in true peaks that exceed 0dBFS? I get that clipping converters can sound cool / desirable, but why not achieve the clipping you want and then print a final master under zero? Why risk a consumer product crapping out during playback and adding potential distortion and why totally disregard pretty much every DSP's recommendation that true peaks not exceed -1 for the encoding process? I'm noticing that a ton of major label releases are peaking above zero with loudness normalization turned off on Spotify.",

Cohension matters, it's just that I find I care less about it than the feeling of the album if that makes sense. @Nomograph Mastering is way more experienced and knowledgeable than me on this.\n\nI'd also push back against your assumption that every song has to have the same output ceiling. This may be \"normal\" but sometimes it's just not the move. Just did an album where one song wanted to be more compressed/limited. So we did that but just literally turned down the gain on the output so it fit better with another quieter (more dynamic, not output level) track before it to match the \"loudness\" of the two more closely.\n\nHard to give any other insight because so much of it is dependent on the actual songs you have, what the artist's vision is, how to serve that, etc. Dynamics/energy/loudness plays a big part in that!",

Which id call a success.\n\nId brought the Pro q output down 0.4db to compensate the gain increase and printed with no limiter.\n\nIn RX this printed version showed as -7.2 LUFS integrated , -6.3 short term, TP 0.0 .\n\nIdeally id have not touched this again.....i really liked it. \n\nFollowing instructions i then put the L2 Limiter on (modern mode , +0.1 db, TP on and output -0.1) .\n\nTruth be told, once id put the limiter on i wanted to go back into the EQ because i didnt like the sound anymore, i felt the L2 spoilt it.",

Currently have a Ruel track on there (love love love the connection to the vocal)\n\nAlso damn I am realizing how hot everything is...could sorta tell before from some other masters I've collected from mixing buds...but I'm pretty consistently about a db quieter (not true peak but in LUFS) than most of the stuff I'm finding...which I think suits the music I'm working, people are happy, I'm a more dynamic type anyway....but just interesting to note I suppose",

The master for reference was returned at around -6.8 LUFS and otherwise feels pretty good there but I\u2019m wondering if:\n\n1) I\u2019m hearing my mix fall apart as it\u2019s being pushed harder into the limiter and can and should be preempting this with carving more mids next time\n2)This is something the ME\u2019s usually just deal with as a price of playing the loudness game or if the suggestion for me to address it in the mix is reasonable.\n3)I should just find another ME for peace of mind so i can stop thinking about this mix \ud83d\ude05\n-",

    "content": "Alright I'm back with another question for the hive mind:\n\nFinishing up an EP today we've been slow-dripping for awhile. First song we did had big drums, tons of low, measures louder (-8.4 LUFS). Mastered and approved before the rest of them came this way. Rest of the songs are sparse, open, beautiful. But accordingly meausre much lower (loudest is -11 LUFS). \n\nSo with the new info Dale posted the other day re: how Spotify is normalizing levels, I thought let's just turn down the louder one a little to see how it fits (it's fine), maybe that can buy us a db or whatever for the other songs when they normalize to the loudest song as long as the creative intent is preserved (it is). And that's cool. But actually a better result IMO was to just ease up on the loudness of the first song (at -8.4 LUFS), it makes more sense in the project being a bit more dynamic rather than having the dense one be pulled down.\n\nQuestion is: will this cause the single version to be replaced by the new album one when going to distro?\n\nI've had masters that we replaced before with a lowered ceiling in projects and all was fine, but the actual master was exactly the same minus the ceiling, so in a single context it would normalize the same. I know to keep exact length to ms, etc etc. \n\nBut the new info Dale posted makes me rethink how to handle this in albums (on Spotify -- on Apple is doesn't seem to be doing that?)",

In reality, the low-level sounds are usually low-level for a reason. Light makes dark darker, nothing is loud if everything is loud, etc...\n\n100% agree. It feels more educational than practical. Could be interesting for experimenting. \ud83e\uddea",

    "content": "Was messing with RX's new Loudness Optimize/Streaming Preview stuff today. So if I'm understanding correctly, it seems like in order to have our masters played as loud as possible through streaming normalization, the quiet sections of the song should be turned up past a certain threshold in order to be included in the integrated loudness reading, with the goal being to decrease the integrated level as much as possible. \n\nNow I had a song with a filtered guitar loop as the intro, and that part was below the loudness threshold shown in the Loudness Optimization module. It was also showing that only 93% of the song was above the threshold and being included in the loudness reading of -9.5 or so. After I ran it, that intro was being compressed pretty obnoxiously, as well as some other down sections of the song, and the integrated went down to -9.7. So I guess I could have gotten 0.2db of extra loudness through normalization, but the upwards compression just did not sound good.\n\nWondering what you all think of it? I guess the moral of the story is to pay attention to the quiet sections of your songs and see if you can make them come in a little hotter, but there's obviously a line there of either gain or compression one is willing to make. Super interesting though and insightful to know all this about streaming! I feel like I can make some moves in mixing to accommodate things like this if necessary.",

Sometimes I work on albums where the mixes are done in a very short time, and other times it takes longer, so the focus changes over time (which is totally natural). Right now, what I\u2019m doing is setting up a mastering session with all the latest mixes (with limiting applied), doing the track list, and listening to the differences between them\u2014things like timbre, balance, loudness, etc. I make notes of what I hear, then go back to the mix sessions to make small tweaks. After that, I export everything without the final clipping/limiting on the tracks, so I can apply those in the final mastering session and then master the album. Anyone with a different approach is more than welcome to share, as right now I\u2019m wrapping up a lot of albums I\u2019ve worked on throughout the year, and I want to stay as sharp as possible to give them a proper finish.",

I suspect this may be where the learning opportunity lies...\n\nI think what matters to me is that 1) the piece is presented in the best way possible to maximise its impact or essence 2) the piece is listenable and that impact is not lost in a wide range of environments / contexts (i was tempted to say \"it translates well\" but I think that's a subtly different thing) 3) the client is happy with the result, and feel confident releasing their art, feeling good about it, feeling it's the best version of what it could be.\n\nI think it's point 3 that gives me pause. You can count my paying mastering clients on one hand, so I'm as \"beginner level\" as it gets, but that said, when i talk to those clients, they share with me that they want a mastering engineer to ensure that their music is going to \"sound right on streaming platforms and translate well to lots of systems\". There's a lot of FUD about loudness normalisation, LUFS, etc. I don't think it's a huge leap to feel that we should also be thinking about common playback devices such as airpods, and bluetooth speakers. For clients who aren't seasoned mixers or record makers, I wonder how they would feel if they listened to their mastered record on a bluetooth speaker and heard that whole parts had practically vanished.

I\u2019m sure a lot of the loudness was baked into the mix but just wanted to say it felt like a bit of a masterclass on tasteful, non-fatiguing loudness. Inspiring!

If an artist and team have made choruses 3dB louder than verses for example, and 3dB or more of limiting is in place, is it appropriate for the mastering engineer to turn up the verses? Sometimes that's what is needed to achieve loudness. My question is less about whether loudness is the goal and more an attempt to describe the philosophy that I was taught, as I understand it. \n\nI think we're saying the same thing?",

Never found a limiter that works most of the time unfortunately. Out of curiocity what is the other limiter that works for you? Finally I used to stack limiters like crazy because it sounded more musical and natural to me. Now its on a song by song case but thanx to all the info here I find myself liking using one limiter with a clipper before it. Bear in mind though that I master exclusively for indie artists that deliver really low mixes and want me to pump them up significantly which is a challenge doing only with one limiter. What are you thoughts lovely people on this matter? Like you get a mix that is on average at -20 to -16 LUFS and they want it to to sound as loud as billboard top 100 tracks \ud83d\ude02",

The style of the documentary was kinda like the old skate videos I used to watch growing up, and his style (he's a graphic artist) fit the vibe very well. The dialogue and music, however, were all over the place level wise, and he kept having to go up to the front and tweak the PA so it wasn't too quiet or too loud. He knows I work in music, so he asked if I could help him with the audio portion of the video, so I want to make sure I deliver something that will work well. I've never done anything for video before, so I wasn't sure if there were specific specs for peak level, dialogue loudness, etc, that I should be following. I seem to remember reading a paper somewhere about it, but can't remember specifics. Thanks!",

Also noted from it that neither Amazon, Youtube or Deezer allow for relative levels from albums.  I've not tested it but was listening to Joni's Hejira last night and the dynamics of that album are all over the shop, I'd be interested to listen to the normalised version on one of the above streamers to see the effect it has on theflow of the record.  It really pisses me off that classic works of art are messed with this way.",

As I'm working I might be catching 6 dB of peaks, but by the time things are mixed I'm getting the loudness at the source instruments or instrument group. My master buss might be averaging 3 dB of gain reduction at the end. If I have heavy transients from the drums hitting my limiter I'll limit the drum group so it's not ducking the entire mix when they hit.\n\nI don't use clippers at all. To my ears they reliably make things sound like mush, but other people seem to get good results with them.\n\nWhen it comes time to master, I'll turn down my limiter and pass it to the ME. Confident that my balance isn't dependent on everything being smushed into a limiter.",

    "content": "(copy/paste)\n\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively). a dB or two of clipping will help the limiter work less.\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

It feels more like I'm engaging the \"clipping stage\" a bit more (if we can call it this way).\nIt seems like above 3dBs of \"constant limiting\", then, the loudness hit a ceiling, and the volume is reduced proportionally. (Apparently this behavior change a bit across the different algorithms) \n\nAm I missing something ?\nShould I stop paying attention to this graph, and use the \"compact mode\" of the GUI ? \ud83d\ude42",
