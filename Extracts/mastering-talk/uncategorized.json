The did something insane with the stereo image that made all of the super wide stuff basically go to the middle. It sounds like a mistake or improper use of a widener. On top of that, there is zero punch in the snare and they made everything STUPID bright. (I mix bright as it is). I'll let those things \"slide\" because they are sort of  a matter of taste. Anyway, I told the artist I thought the stereo image was fucked up. What's the best approach to telling them I generally think the master(s) are horrible? Should I just let it go? Should I tell them politely I think there might be a mistake? (First time dealing with this tbh!)",

I eventually could hear it was a mangled version of my mix. I essentially told him, respectfully, it seems like a mistake was made with the stereo image. Then later gently mentioned that the snare was completely missing / had no punch. He listened back and forth and agreed with both points. He ultimately said he just listened and thought it sounded good and didn't' bother to compare.  (He's a super easy going / nice artist)\n\nAnyway, I am just trying not to shit all over this guy. I don't want to be a dick at ALL, it's a local engineer and everything. You make a good point of simply asking them what they think first. I had such a visceral emotional reaction, it was hard not to just be like \"this sounds horrible, this cannot be what gets released\".\n\nI am sure this happens a LOT.",

So it\u2019s kind of self-selecting for experiences that I\u2019m particularly invested in when I actually interface with mastering. And therefore, I\u2019ve really appreciated the moments when people can just let it be and act as quality control.",

They don't work like a normal compressor does, and it's odd how the release characteristic sets in. The way he seems to have it dialed, in my understanding, isn't doing the bpm thing that I think he thinks it is (though of course this doesn't mean it doesn't sound good)\n\nSomeone posted the article deep diving into the Pro L2 thing on here before.

Or rather can articulate it deeply. And the results speak for themselves.\n\nI think the takeaway is to put reps in and develop your intuition rather than some specific technical technique. And be open to new ideas (but also to rejecting them). Somewhere along the way a personal style and taste develop (I am still very much on this path)",

What you change when you high pass the sidechain is the control signal - the instructions to the compression on *when* to compress. So high passing means that the low end triggers the compressor less, but when the compressor reduces gain the low end is attenuated along with everything else",

Knowledge is good. \n\nBut I'm also wary of the responses of the type of @macca...(I say this in a kind way to challenge you)...you just assume that what Ruairi says is good and that you've learned something about mastering. Maybe. But also maybe you're a totally different ear than him, and a more aggressive approach suits you better!\n\nI've always been a pretty minimal processor so I think his and my approach are sorta just fits from the get-go.\n\nI really regard Ruairi very highly and have learned an immense amount from him...and the main thing is to trust your own taste and find out for yourself. So I'd challenge everyone on here to take the simple exercises and use it as a way to bring out your taste and point of view...and be very intentional about that. Don't just take his word for it, even though it's probably right most of the time.",

When you see stage actors up close after a show they have heavily-caked makeup, bags painted under their eyes, over-emphasized eyebrows and tons of blush. It's all so that the face can be read and easily perceived as \"natural\" by people in the audience who are viewing them from 100 ft away.\n\nAn analogous example in records would be something like Jimmy Page's guitar tracks. They were recorded on a 20-watt amp and when solo'ed in a mix they sound anemic and harsh. But that bite allows them to cut while the electric bass and the drums fill in the low-end. Then the listener's brain perceive's Jimmy's guitars as going very low, when they're, in fact, super thin.",

I\u2019m a firm believer in focusing on the \u201cart\u201d of producing/mixing/mastering until you reach a technical problem, such as CPU issues, then learn as much as you can. Newfangled Saturator is an example of a high-cpu setting on by default (problem), that has led me to try to get real-world professional opinions/solutions, so I can make up my own mind on whether it\u2019s useful.",

    "content": "I'm sure @Nomograph Mastering will have someting to say on this but in my partial dalliances with radio playlisting there are a lot of variables.  Some of my records get played on different BBC stations: 6Music, Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and BBC Radio 3.  Each station sounds different, so when one of the songs was playlisted on 6Music it also got played on the other stations and consequently sounded all over the shop.  I don't think they use Optimod procesing anymore but there is an ingest process which 6 music use and each file gets normalised to BBC Scale 6.  After this each DJ has has control over the volume level, which means they can push into the compressor.  This is a big sound for some DJs.  So I have no answers really apart from trying to be a little bit Zen about it.  It will sound different, but quite often a demo recorded for a late night Radio Cymru show will sound louder.  Dynamics, and micro dynamics win on radio which is why Arcade Fire's second record always sounded small to me on radio even with Spike Stent mixing some of the songs. (Too many overdubs)",

This compressed sound of mainstream radio is what I\u2019m digging into because the sound of the top 20 playlistEd tunes on capital radio for example \u2026..really hit the broadcast compression beautifully . Where I work it\u2019s a case of mono 110v portable speakers on site (makita/ dewalt etc) and I swear the sound of dua lipa and the like through one of those sounds Blimmin unbelievable !",

As much as people would have me believe, mastering wasn\u2019t processing stuff with esoteric analog gear in an ivory tower and then descending from on high to bestow one\u2019s genius onto the world. It was listening deeply and appreciating and loving a record for what it is. I love that records can be their own little worlds with their own language and idiosyncrasies. Being in a position to help reveal and enhance a world that somebody is trying to bring to life is at the nexus of where I think all of my musical skillsets, taste, and wiring of my brain are most valuable to other people. Having been an artist on the other side of it, I know what it\u2019s like to pour blood sweat and tears into a record only to have a bummer of an experience at the last step. And so I am also motivated by providing an experience that stokes people out, rather than create more uncertainty. \n\nInterested to hear other people's takes.",

Often just upping the numbers of bands (I like to think of them as buckets after I heard Ruairi mention that) can do it, sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nIt\u2019s just a situation where you have to listen, it\u2019s usually obvious on the actual spectral view but like @Rollmottle it can be finicky sometimes.\n\nI avoided it in the vid because it\u2019s a fairly rare problem that mostly, if not exclusively applies to treating an entire mix with full spectrum audio!

    "content": "Yes and a few reasons why.\n\nFirstly, I just didn\u2019t have the time anymore to real time bounce - especially when it came to multiple deliverables (Main, ACA, INST, TV, Clean, etc).\n\nAnd Secondly going out and back in opens more opportunity for unintended changes to happen to the master, like LR Balance or dropped samples - you have to watch for that stuff like a hawk - so QC time increases as well keeping an eye out. More time spent bouncing and QCing, means less time available for more work and even less personal time.\n\nThirdly, I learned pretty quickly that people really love their mixes and the less I do to a track and the more I get out of the way to finish it, the happier everyone is. Having \u201cfun\u201d with gear (to me) was just me putting myself/ego into the equation and truthfully I just needed to get out of the way.\n\nFitter, Happier, More Productive.",

I was pretty bummed, but looking back, even if I\u2019d done it, the whole process would have been a colossal pain in the ass and the record would probably have sucked.

It's refreshing to hear open & interesting discussions on mastering rather than the usual shouty forum stuff.\n\nThere are nuggets given away kindly and freely that took me years of trail, error, and utter balls ups to come to the same place. \ud83d\udc4c\n\nOn the analogue vs. digital thing, I agree it's done to death.\n\nI went ITB a few years back, for one important reason, recalls. If you're a ME without a team, recalls are on you. Any time or place.\n\nI've had projects signed off, and the mix changes hours before release (seems to happen more on bigger projects, with majors). \n\nOne of these I was away. As my laptop mirrors my studio, I was able to have new masters printed, QCd, and back in under 30. It built trust and led to more work. \nIf, instead, I'd have said;\n\n\"I need a week to fire up my tubes, I'm on holiday,\" \n\nGame Over. Man. Game Over.",

There is no general rule sub 30hz so don't try and preemptively deal with something if you're not even sure it's an issue.\n2. If you do need to deal with a low end issue, deal with it at the source, instead of the 2-mix if you can.\n3.

Any reason why this would be the case, any solution so that I\u2019m hearing it better elsewhere? Im almost always doing a QC with a combo of mains and LCDX but find that it\u2019s good to do a once over with the sennheisers to make sure nothing is being pushed too hard.

People who know you are on their team aren\u2019t usually trying to screw you.  That being said, I had a situation recently where  I Finished a mix and 3 months went by without getting paid. The red flag here was poor communication from their end.  Not responding to emails or texts for weeks ect. In which I gave them the benefit of the doubt. After no response and not being paid I started to write this off as a loss, but I  then continued to contact them every other day. ( hey I hope everything is ok, did you receive my email ? I\u2019d love to settle up) ect.  Finally I was paid in full and I won\u2019t work with them again and I\u2019ve changed nothing on my end.

Generally speaking, I find the moves can be way bigger than they\u2019d be in a typical song with a vocal (eg .35db vs 6db+). Don\u2019t be afraid of huge boosts to pull out what\u2019s there. Invariably, there\u2019s interesting textures there in the synths in the upper registers that can help make the track come to life.  Saturation can be your friend. This kind of music and take a lot of processing before falling apart or changing the intent. Don\u2019t be afraid to lean into what\u2019s there. \n\nThe kick and bass is ultimately what's going to make or break the track, so make sure you're using your calories to get that right before adding anything up top. Get the low end hitting and maybe you'll find the mids and highs are fine as is.",

The management I was talking to relayed to me -- the artists were saying they needed more \"active mastering\" on the non-A-list mix, and the manager told them \"no, you just need someone who is good and who actually listens\". I thought that was a great way to put it. Just listen to the record and what it is asking for (usually not all the color and stuff stuff stuff). And on the off chance it needs extra extra, just go there since the art wants it, removing the ego yada yada.\n\nTurns out, the moves dones are what I would consider \"the same amount\" to both mixes (minus some volume stuff, which one needed to be pumped up a bit to make sense)",

I don't have mine automated to trigger the various states but that's possible too.  It was a bit confusing at first but once you learn their methodology and get setup it's fairly straightforward.  I did find it helpful to think through how I wanted things to run before I set it up, that probably saved some headaches.",

More than one thing can be true at the same time, Reaper may have the best feature set and capabilities for mastering, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong for not using it or for preferring other tools.

Define your taste,  try your best to make things sound the way you hear it.  Any experienced mixer or ME has been in situations where they might not be psyched  on every decision but that sometimes comes with the gig. The best way around it is to politely back  out if you don\u2019t stand by it or make your own music they way you want. This has helped me not be judgmental but define what I like",
