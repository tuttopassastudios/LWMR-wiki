Two incredible record makers (with one Grammy between them!) who consistently make us laugh and think.\n\n@Rollmottle & @NoahNeedleman, who were such beautiful and consistent parts of the community that they earned the responsibility of becoming our most recent moderators. \n\nAnd @Davi Juno, who doesn't post much here, but has done all the editing and formatting for the YouTube versions of the Instagram streams, as well as all the clips.\n\nAll of these people are hugely responsible for this space!",

The @moderators have had a long-running discussion about the risk of a scam happening in the sales channel. As the server continues to scale, it\u2019s only a matter of time and is the last thing we want to have happen. \n\nWe\u2019ve decided to restrict the sales channel to members who have been here 3 months or more and have been regularly active on the server. New members will no longer see the channel and will have to request access from one of the mods once they\u2019ve been here longer than 3 months and have established themselves on the server. We\u2019ve been looking for a bot that will help us automate this, but out of an abundance of caution, this was the simplest (free-est) solution for now.",

Having only experienced studio work as a cottage industry up to that point, PP opened my eyes to avenues I could pursue that I wouldn\u2019t have known even existed otherwise (recording engineer is different to mixing engineer is different to producer is different to songwriter??!). It all seems very rudimentary now, but I was starting from literally nothing in a place with few (if any?) visible role models.\n\nI learned so much from it on a technical level - from basic stuff like what a Pultec is and how people use it (connecting the dots between my cracked Waves bundle - Puigtec and who tf JJP was), what \u201ca vocal chain\u201d might look like and the purpose of each stage\u2026\n\nTrue, the interviews did become unbearable, but there was a golden era between eps around 30-90 at a time when outside of working in the studio world, there weren\u2019t many other sources of good information from people who were really doing it.\n\nHuge appreciation for Dave, and I hope he and his family get the support they need.",

The sliders are in effect zero sum, in that the closer you are to one end then less you have of the attribute on the other end.

I hate to complicate an already nuanced premise at the outset, but when I observe my own choices and think of each category I see myself living both sides of all three spectrums, but in different domains:\n\n**For example:** I could be short-term in career objectives and overt achievement and long-term oriented in relationships and satisfaction. Cutting edge in creative pursuits, but classics in my personal taste. Specialist in my mode of expression, and generalist in my interests.\n\nThe more I subdivide and examine the question the more I find exceptions to everything. I am steeped in knowledge, but I seek wisdom above most things, which some philosophies would consider contradictory.\n\nThis Anais Nin quote comes to mind:\n\n> \"We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made of layers, cells, constellations.\"\n\nI think people are extremely lopsided and unbalanced when you start to drill down into their psyches, and that's wonderful! \n\nFor the sake of refining this question and narrowing the scope, should we confine these three axis to only record making?

Into the coaxial cable that runs into the center console, for that true old analog gold plated warmth. Turned the windows and volume all the way up, then as I prepared to hit play. I was blanketed with the all to familar tension. That very same feeling from when I was going to have to sit next to one of the two dudes on the middle school basketball team. Who took as their daily task, to pay homage to ancestral animal social structures, by drowning any nearby male counter part with sack taps, donkey punches, and nail whip flicks. You just preemptively flinch at the inevitable pain from their onslaught. I hit play on a mix that is -5.8 lufs at peak. No proverbial donkey punch to my thighs this time. The song didn't overload the speakers at any point. As I heard the mix in my studio. I heard it here. The things I loved about it. I loved it here. The things I was unsure about. I was equally unsure about them here. My eyes welled up a bit with fulfillment and gratitude. It took me longer and cost more than I could of ever imagined, when I started this journey. But I got here. No longer do I have to worry about translation of the mix. I can focus all my worry on the feeling and vibe of the performace. I'm willing to let my ego have this one, this mix punches with any modern mix on earth. On any system. (Sounds killer on the Meta Ray Bans. And those speakers are rutheless honest. Ive heard alot of overloaded low end mixes on em) And back to the gratitude. I wanted to thank this place. I couldn't have done it without yall. I'd still be in a pitch black room looking for a switch that felt like it was hidden on the ceiling. Now back to work! Have a great day yall!!",

Probably won't fully be recovered for another 18-24 months.\n2. Depends on the need. For a business, leasing probably makes more sense than owning. The lease can be taken as a deduction.\n3. If you are buying new, you will eat the depreciation cost. If you are buying used, the depreciation is already priced in. If you want a relatively new car, I will always recommend going Certified Pre-Owned. One of the better deals in automotive with the benefit of a likely extended warranty coverage. There are plenty of high quality used vehicles out there that are effectively new (full disclosure, I work for Carvana...the vehicles are reconditioned similar to CPO standard). My last I don't know how many cars have all been gently used late-model used cars. Cars these days are more durable and reliable than they've ever been. Low risk in buying late-model used. I will only ever buy used anymore.\n4. Whoever offers you the lowest APR. That is often the captive lender, but rates are a bit of a cluster fuck these days so shop around for the lowest. One fun fact: if you are buying from a dealer, APR's are negotiable. They will tell you that's the best they can do, but they take margin on the loan. There's meat on the bone there if you want to do battle. \n5. Car prices can fluctuate seasonally yes, but wouldn't try and time the market. You won't save that much.",

Irving Azoff has not made a lot of bad decions, historically. I also wouldn't be so confident in making calculations based on a few press release numbers. Catalog deals of this kind are incredibly complicated and have so much nuance. Like, does a $1mil record deal mean something? Yeah, but to make any judgement about it, you'd need a lot more detail. Catalog deals are much more complicated than a record deal.\n\nLike I said, you might be right. But many good counterpoints too. Very interesting times. I definitely enjoyed reading your thoughts.",

That alien sound came about because extremely loose muscles create far less sympathetic intermodulation which sounds cleaner. It\u2019s the same as how a speaker makes your desk vibrate and create out of time interference pattern distortions. Muscle tension creates hard surfaces that do the same when singing and opera singers obsess over undoing this. This is a big reason why so many of your favorite vocalists are opioid and benzo addicts. It\u2019s not just culture. Downers are performance enhancing here. (Please don\u2019t get any ideas artists) \n\nThe modern pop voice is just maintaining that exaggerated opera looseness but with adaptations for the modern medium: English diphthongs instead of Latin ones, way less air in their lungs because the target is a foot from their mouth instead of 50 feet, and softened fricatives because a capsule right in front of the mouth harshly exaggerates fricatives. \n\nFrom a physics perspective it\u2019s the perfectly optimized way to sing in 2024.

I like to think a smart trusted friend would agree but I\u2019d also wanna know if there\u2019s anything else they\u2019re seeing. \n\nI wanna use my time in school to give back this year. Even though I can\u2019t do music full time I\u2019ve been freelancing.

It really bums me out when I see people in the local scene who are super good, passionate, and hardworking when it comes to creating their music met with roadblocks caused by bad rooms, poor engineering, and economics. \n\nIf anyone wants to chime in with ideas, I\u2019m thinking of offering a free session to students at my university to come record with me/just letting friends I trust into my spaces to use while I\u2019m in class or whatever",

You observe the long legs, the muscles, the skin, the eyes, the respiratory system, etc. You see it's strengths and you see it's weaknesses and you draw your conclusions from there. This would be the top-down learning approach. It's good at describing what already *is*. \n\nOr...\n\n2) You build/design a frog from scratch. You will quickly come to understand why things *have* to be the way they are. You realize that all of the evolutionary \"choices\" about a frog's physiology are simply the best possible compromises, given the pressures of the environment, the availability of resources, and the limits of physics. By building it yourself you will come to perceive all of the invisible challenges and \"solved\" problems that were required to make an organism that will simply survive, much less thrive.\n\nThis firsthand experience of building the thing will actually make you an expert because you've done the hard work and experienced it for yourself. You took ten paths to failure and made every mistake before settling on a a non-obvious compromise that allows you to balance it against every other factor. You understand *why* it needs to be that way.\n\nThis knowledge will make you robust and flexible, whereas top-down knowledge is more superficial and brittle. If the conditions of your subject change and the model you understand is no longer relevant then you're in a far more precarious place than someone who's built something from the ground up.",

In fact, I got to sit in front of *three* different Atmos rigs in three different (treated) rooms that evening and two of them were undoubtedly set up as good as they could have possibly been (One was a PMC showroom and the other built and tuned with their input). While the speakers themselves were impressive and very capable, the actual experience felt pretty disjointed. There was a pronounced feeling of phasi-ness that I didn't like.\n\nIt was great hearing these records on a rig that probably cost $250k, but my big takeaway was that they felt disjointed and odd. Even when sitting in the sweet spot.\n\nPerhaps my opinion will change with more exposure, but I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the time and effort. I will add, though, that half the mixes we heard were up-mixed from old stereo recordings with minimal track counts and only two of them were modern productions.",

Eventually Dylan stepped out into the live room and got right up into the guy's face and said something really condescending to him about when to play. As Dylan turned away the guy describes having \"nothing but contempt for Dylan in that moment\" and he got super defiant and went into \"Fuck you, Dylan\" mode on the next take. Once the take was done he was left in silence to wonder. And as he squinted into the control room he could see everyone laughing their asses off. Apparently the whole think was a ruse by the control room to get a certain performance out of him.",

Some of more recent PT sessions open right up and play back perfectly. The real question is how much to fuck with them before sending them off. When is enough, enough? I've rocked some these mixes around town in my car for almost a decade. It almost feels wrong to mess with the mixes, but there's just so much that can be improved upon.

    "content": "This is definitely an interesting period in AI developments. Lots of exciting and novel tools exploding right now that are threatening to replace certain modes of illustration, writing, programming, and audio.\n\nIt seems likely that certain roles for creators are going to be diminished. Photography was a huge blow to illustrators when it emerged. Portraiture and photo-realism used to be the domain of painters. But when those skills became trivially easy to replicate the next generation of painters had to pivot into something else that played to the unique strengths of painting. I can't say what the actual causation is for sure, but the entire 20th century was dominated by abstract representation in painting, as one example of what that shift might look like.\n\nPerhaps as creators our domains will need to shift into something else. Something more taste-driven and creative.\n\nThese AI tools can emulate pre-existing material well, but they still lack creativity, taste, and informed judgement. So I think the roles that are likely to remain (until another massive development) are matters of taste and curation. Somebody still needs to steer these tools to make something useful or novel.",

(Assuming, you can already hum a melody on the spot and are not tone deaf) \n\nI wouldnt worry too much about theory and super correct technique. \n\nThe best Way to get anywhere on an instrument is by Playing it, and doing in consistently. Set some realistic goals and just get going, vocabulary and technique Will come naturally if you just keep Playing. \n\nFuck Playing scales and inversions and all that for now. \nJust go learn a metric ton of songs and melodies and learn to play them together. Do it by Ear. It Will be tough in the beginning, but you Will get very decent quickly if you just do the most important Thing, which is being consistent.\n\nI would reccomend setting a low minimum to do everyday to keep a realistic goal that you can keep, rather than a higher on you miss every now and then. You can always add more practice but it sucks to miss out on it.\n\nStart with song you want to Sound like and then you can slowly branch out when the style become second Nature for you. \n\nSadly there are no tricks or hacks or whatever youtube wants you to beleive to get their clicks. Its all about muscle memory and developing your ears together. And not to Sound like 4 bar loop, but consistency, and do it a lot. I cannot stress that enough. \u2764\ufe0f",

When I'm improvising/practicing I like to try and play four note voicings in my right hand and without really thinking too much about theory just do a lot of stepwise motion.  I think just being able to feel your way around the keys and get really really comfortable with it in the same way you are probably really comfortable on fretboards is going to help a lot.  Improvising in a lot of different keys will also be a big help in getting your familiarity honed in.\n\nAnother thing that really helped whip me into shape quickly is playing with other people, having to listen and react and find a pocket and not step on other instruments - all of that translates really well into part writing for me now.",

I think unlimited music is certainly worth that. Setting aside, for the moment, all of the other complexities around market pricing, we also need to remember that Spotify's largest streaming competitors are Apple and Amazon.\n\nThese are companies with massive war-chests derived from the success of their non-streaming companies. Even if Spotify *wanted* to raise the cost of their service, companies like Apple and Amazon can afford to keep the price of streaming services depressed and sustain a loss on their streaming services for far longer than Spotify ever could. To my eyes, Spotify doesn't have a whole lot of wiggle-room to adjust their pricing and therefore their payout models.\n\nI say as much, because in casual discussions around streaming payouts, there doesn't seem to be much awareness of the larger business ecosystem that a company like Spotify finds itself in.",

Like a shit hot live band playing off each other Andy\u2019s faders are always moving, parts are constantly responding to other parts, decisions are being made about sonic and part priorities.\n\nI think one of the main reasons when i asked the round table what their favorite mixes were, almost no modern mixes (last 5-10 years or so) came up.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard concept for me to verbalize, but I think we have a lot of people focused on the wrong thing and misunderstanding WHY mixes resonated, and now they\u2019re all chasing the wrong thing. Like my thoughts on if you asked a berklee student who the best guitarist was they\u2019d pick some shredder, because they think technical wizardry is the benchmark, when the people whose playing makes you FEEL something tend to go way farther.\n\nEnough mixers think that a clean 26hz and a saturated 26k is what the goal of a mix is and you end up with a bunch of songs that are really clear but really boring and uninspiring.",

When doing it this way MD  stand-alone has the edge over the plug-in because it\u2019s all right there in front of me. It\u2019s easy to visually reference a quad tracked lead vocal, and then align and de ess or consonant 8 harmonies. That\u2019s where the stand-alone really shines, is massively dense stacks vocals like that, and not having to keep opening up a plug-in to change a different part or vibrato or formant of a particular track  of the stack or what not. Especially once you get the groove locked in on the lead, it\u2019s just so easy to make all other 30 tracks lock in with it. \n\nFor a solo vocal soul song? I\u2019m probably just audio suiting AT in graph mode in PT. It ultimately sounds the best.",

Maybe there's something in the \"popular music education\" lane. We'll keep digging!\n\nAgain, really appreciate all the feedback y'all!",

I think it\u2019s worth being careful mythologizing this idea of the solo sovereign agentic artist who heroically navigates the music industry. Would this artist really be better off spending their time reading the latest edition of Music Money and Success and trying to figure out how the frick YouTube content ID works? OR would they be better served focusing on the music as the artist in your example said. There may be no greater form of leverage in this industry than being the bearer of great art. Even the so called experts can barely explain how music publishing works. Maybe everyone else should just do their job and let the artist cook. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

If you bought a Waves plugin 15 years ago, how long are they expected to provide support for the one time purchase? Given that operating systems and DAW updates are always going to provide a moving target, it doesn't seem unreasonable to have some sort of upgrade fee or plan for them to cover their costs in the development of updated software. I just think with Waves, their whole pricing model is on drugs and it's hard to attain any semblance of sanity from their upgrade plans.",

I can always HDMI I figure if I need the extra real estate.\n\nThe only acustica plug I run regularly is Ruby 2 - seems to cause pretty drastic spikes on the CPU short term in Ableton (running rosetta mode and VST3 by the way) but then it levels out.  In general I've been super impressed with the performance vs my desktop.  I'd say for my mixes it runs maybe 80% as well on large projects (75+ tracks, lots of processing) which was more than I was expecting.  Smaller projects and productions and softsynths it absolutely chews through compared to my desktop.\n\nWas just trying out a little mix in Studio One just on the 14\" and it felt very cramped to me.  I think it'd be hard to completely mix at this resolution but again it probably has more to do with what I'm used to.  Would definitely recommend a separate display if you are going to be doing all your work on it.",

    "content": "If you\u2019re confident enough to hit various scales spanning 2+ octaves in each hand (in sync and delayed/one at a time) and you have a decently strong level of piano sight reading ability, then I\u2019d say a piano teacher might be worth lessons every so often if it\u2019s affordable because I\u2019d say you\u2019re starting to max the limits of your ability to assess your execution of technique (you\u2019ll want someone to actually watch how you move, see where you should go, and give you specific cues on what you can shore up from there). \n\nBut honestly when I was training classical piano regularly as a kid (good god I feel old saying that but I know I\u2019m not lol), majority of upper level technique mishaps stemmed from struggles with proper wrist & elbow position where students would let their form slide (the more advanced the composition you were playing, the harder it became to remember your technique) and so they\u2019d lack the actual strength and muscle twitch to hit harder moves.   That along with finger strength & dexterity would often result in stumbles or slips, which also vary based on how you strike the key. Most common error you\u2019ll see that slows down technique is wrists dipping below the fingers a la traditional keyboard typing at any point in the playing process, and you\u2019re never gonna swing an arpeggio or move fast enough to trill because your physical relation to the keys is what dictates proficiency. The physical aspect is why pianists are brought in so young (I started at supervised playing at 4 and I started instruction when I could get through the alphabet), because you can shape them into technique machines. \n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for max utility, finger drills, wrist position, and scales as much as possible is going to keep you sharp as hell.",

I'm doing 4 octave scale runs with both hands at various tempos to focus on consistency of fingering and of tone. The next frontier is doing a variation of these runs where one hand starts on a scale different interval (going up in 3rds, 4ths, etc...)\n\nThe exercise that's challenging me at the moment has been doing wide arpeggios (sometimes with intervals of a 7th or more) up and down a two octaves. I'm taking it slow and becoming more consistent, but I know I'm likely to start hitting a wall as I get them up to a quicker tempo, hence the renewed focus on really getting my technique right at these tempos.\n\nI've very much internalized the concept of \"Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.\" I'm starting things slow and not moving on until I can do them flawlessly at glacial tempos.\n\n@ehutton21 I think you're right about a teacher. LA is undoubtedly full of good ones. A lesson a week should help me to orient myself in the right direction.\n\nThank you for all of the insight.",

In hindsight, it was incredibly formative for me that ear training practice and actual theoretical/sheet music knowledge always came alongside the practical element of sitting at keys and performing the pieces I was assigned that week.\n\nI like the idea of breaking down modern pop structure, I like the idea of covering signal flow a lot. I think you can teach and test signal flow in theory while allowing someone to practice their recording technique by mimicking the song structure of their favorite pop song. I\u2019m not proposing that as an actual coursework suggestion (I doubt most would be ready for that week one) but just as a thought for course organization",

I think the most interesting announcements (though not necessarily cool) were Microsoft and Google both announcing the integration of predictive-text models (ala Chat-GPT) into their office suites. For example, Gmail and Google Docs are likely to have the capability to summarize emails or documents (cool) and will also be able to draft a full body of text based on a given prompt.\n\nWe're now on the path to widespread implementation of these tools. It's interesting, but I'm also curious to see the effects this will have on how we interact with one another. What does it mean if you're relying on auto-generated text and no longer writing it yourself? Will it blunt our thinking? Will the world be filled with auto-generated nonsense? How might people abuse it? What cool innovations and uses will we discover?\n\nhttps://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai",

Here\u2019s a more detailed explanation of the chord choices:\n\nD - - - | G - - - | Bb - - - | A - - - |\nD - - - | G - - - | Bb - C#7 - | F#m7b5 B7 E7 |\nThe first four bars are in D major and use the I-IV-V chords (D-G-A). The fifth and sixth bars repeat this progression. In the third bar, we use the Neapolitan chord (Bb major), which is a chromatic chord that is built on the lowered second scale degree. It\u2019s called the Neapolitan chord because it was commonly used in classical music from Naples. In the seventh bar, we start to modulate to E minor by using a ii-V-I progression in that key (F#m7b5-B7-E7). This progression is commonly used to modulate to a new key in jazz and other styles of music.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nsheesh",

    "content": "another one I\u2019m thinking is how a lot of artists are funding their projects through gofundme or kickstarter type ask. \n\nThe issue a lot of times is that we (musicians, engineers, producers, writers) are getting paid by artists paying out of pocket, whom also need a day job to support what they do most of the times. So what ends up happening is that we\u2019re struggling relying on making a living paid by those who are also struggling. \n\nThe culture of music should shift towards the direction where if the artist is able to provide enough values for people to want to hear more work from them, then people should be down to fund it. The issue is that everyone\u2019s expenses are more likely going to be prioritizing commodities over intangible products like music. NFT seemed to attempt commodifying music, but just like modern art paintings- they just became a method of investment for monetization, avoiding taxes, or status; nor it was accessible enough for everyday people to want to get into it.",

The problem I was trying to solve was making my working drive available to me for when I\u2019m away from my studio so I can continue to be responsive to clients at all times. \n\nTailscale allows you to create a secure, private VPN without having to have a networking PHD and compromising your network. Basically install the client on a device, 2-factor auth into the client and any other client you have installed on any device signed in with those same credentials are available to you as if you\u2019re on the same local network, even if you\u2019re on another network anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s an actual game changer.\n\nFor a variety of reasons including keeping my mastering rig lean and clean and because the rig is not always on because I don\u2019t want to run my HVAC 24/7, I sync a clone of my working drive from my mastering rig to a drive attached to an always-on Mac in my home network that has the Tailscale client authenticated. I\u2019ve got screen share enabled on that Mac and now from any other device, I can sign into it and grab whatever I need from that clone drive. You can install the client on virtually any device including NAS\u2019s and mobile phones so it opens up whole new avenues in how to think about availability of your data, traveling, 3rd party cloud vs. rolling your own, etc. Tons of possibilities. Really big fan. Love the future.\n\nhttps://tailscale.com/",

That\u2019s cool and all, but here\u2019s the thing:\n\nMy perception of tempo can shift dramatically from day to day, and I wish I knew how to make it more consistent.\n\nI\u2019ll work on a mix one day and it will feel like it\u2019s pushing the tempo and flying along. Then I can sit down the following day and it is *dragging*. Sluggish. Same record. No actual change. It\u2019s all my perception.\n\nHas anyone figured out a strategy to minimize this phenomenon?",

Because there's no real information and accountability from streaming services, we're simply unmoored when it comes to trying to solve it for modern music consumption. It's just a fact that people don't listen to CDs anymore, and this is an irrelevant topic on vinyl, so it all comes down to streaming services. Only when they pull back the curtain will we actually be able to answer this question. Until then, everyone is just guessing and hoping for the best.",

    "content": "In a space that small, as much absorption as you can have will help you. Do you have a bigger room to record in or do you need the isolation? You'll likely get better sonic results if you can find a room with some more volume... that will also allow you to play with position in front of the microphone. As far as the level you should record at, if you've got any half-decent mic pre than you can go into the computer pretty conservatively. Assuming you don't have a super noisy chain, there'll be plenty of headroom in a 24 bit recording to bring it up after the fact. If you're looking for numbers, I'd shoot to get things into your DAW at around -18 dBFS. Many of the plugins modeled after analog gear tend to be happier with that level (or less if you're unsure).",

    "content": "Anyway: uncompressed PCM audio (.wav and .aiff) is made up of digital words generally 16 or 24 bits long recorded however many times a second for a given sample rate, for fixed point (integer) values. Each bit represents ~6dB of dynamic range. Every time you go up in level 6dB from that particular sample point, another bit flips from 0 (off) to 1 (on). The least significant bit defines your noise floor, so 16 bit audio has 96dB of dynamic range at maximum from noise floor to full scale (every bit turned on). Seems simple enough, right? And it isn't super complicated. But it has one problem: you run out of dynamic range real quick if you're changing levels with (virtual) faders at 24 bits. There are two ways around that:\n1, make the mixer engine run on a much higher integer word length (like old Pro Tools HD systems, which use 48 bit integer), and the mixer automatically converts the audio (if anything is done to it, including fader moves) to 48 bit. Think of this as adding more digits to the fractions side of a decimal point. \n2, make the mixer engine run on a floating point system (almost every other DAW, including more modern versions of Pro Tools) - that is, you move *where the decimal point is* . 32 bit float effectively works as 24 bits that can be moved around more or less with impunity, up or down.",

There actually are some adjustments that can be made which would benefit certain singers. Sade for example has a tendency to sing her seconds and minor thirds pure(which makes her quite sharp in relation to ET). Also, the thirds aren\u2019t just a \u201cbit\u201d off, they\u2019re 15 cents off, which is a massive difference. It really changes the whole harmonic character of the music. I have a loooot to say on the subject, really, I\u2019ve been studying it deeply for a few years now.",

To apply that logic to situations beyond the time value of money isn\u2019t the whole picture: that law of economics only compares value, it doesn\u2019t tell us that concentrating labor for short term gains yields the best possible business model. By that logic, there is an argument that everyone\u2019s best business decision is to forego longterm relationship building, knowledge acquisition (which is like R&D for producers), and strictly focus on maximizing immediate sales (which could look like everyone hopping on beatstars, fiverr, and enginears) which would diminish resources like this very discord, and probably a lot of reputations too!",

Just don't get sick, and DEFINITELY don't have any chronic illnesses.This dysfunction applies to social services in general. Where things can be privatised, they have been, and where they haven't, they don't really work.\n\nThen there are socio-cultural factors. Politics is a spectator sport, and Americans LOVE sports. Red team and blue team *hate* each other with a passion that is unmatched by political parties pretty much anywhere there isn't an active civil war on. Related but slightly different, race-based animosity is becoming more and more of a problem again the last few years after half a century of social progress. You will be able to avoid getting dragged into this by being an expat/resident alien/what have you, but you need to be aware that it's there. Another related issue to this is education. The vast majority of people in the US did not receive anything close to an adequate education to function in the modern globalised world, even if they went to college. This leads to a lot of parochialism and narrow-mindedness that spreads bad ideas fast.",

So i go out there to decompress from london regularly.....i mention Cali myself because when my sis moved there a few years back I\u2019d go out on long runs....and its just fields and semi arid hills as far as the eye can see and ocean on the other side. It reminded me so much of SOCAL , the only difference is that it is so underdeveloped still and must be what Cali was like 100 years ago. A land of orange farms and v little water. I told my sis this a couple years ago and sure enough local news reports Hollywood films being made over there in the next few years (a bit like Sergio leane with the spaghetti westerns in Spain ) . Would love a dm about those local spots as well man thanks. Did ya ever make it to Bilbao? It\u2019s a great town and the museum of modern art by gaudi is a sight",

    "content": "I'm trying to zoom out here. Like, what is the actual revenue being brought in by the artists you're hoping to work with? Where is money to be made and who's making it? \n\nPicking a nice round number, if you're an engineer on an album that gets a million streams a year, that's something like $4000 for the artist. Hopefully they generate money from touring, but based on the album's services alone, how much could an artist reasonably pay if their ROI is $4k?\n\nIf the gamble is to get hooked up with a new artist who has the potential to break through, the producer's points on a hit is where real money could be made, right? So pricing yourself to get at many chances at the lottery would likely be more fruitful than a few extra hundred per gig, but it's a gamble. Between repeat clients and chance for a moderate hit, it seems like a better way to spend your time\n\nAll that said, as you pointed out, this ain't my lane.",

    "content": "I guess it depends heavily on scale. $40 a month just to keep the doors open sounds steep for an artist who isn't already selling merch at a consistent rate. I haven't looked at Shopify's print on demand pricing, but in general POD is much higher cost than bulk screen printing t-shirts (for example). So if you're a band selling at the scale where $40/mo. on a slow month isn't your *entire* profit margin, it seems like investing in a run of merch would pay for itself.\n\nNow this is completely different if you look at it from the perspective of a clothing brand, where the goal is to have a diversity of designs available at all times, without the need for warehousing and a huge startup cost, and to consistently push sales to a customer base that's devoted to *the merch*. I can't imagine the vast majority of DistroKid artists are going that hard on ecommerce, but they could sure benefit from having their POD merch visible on their Spotify profile. The small artists I work with would probably be better off putting $40 into Instagram ads every month.",

    "content": "Sometimes you can see them coming a mile away and sometimes you can\u2019t. I feel like the more I do this the easier it becomes to spot and the scales are starting to tip heavily into you see it coming side. I find it helpful to think of each time as a case by case sort of thing. Are you young and just coming up trying to cut your teeth or in a quieter than usual month with bills looming? Then probably you\u2019ll end up saying yes to more things that you would usually swerve. Are you busier than ever beating off business with a 10ft pole, then maybe you don\u2019t need to take this gig. I try and deal with it preemptively in this way, can it be avoided before we\u2019ve even begun? In which case I\u2019d probably swerve the project. If you\u2019re already in deep and working I\u2019d try and just power through like you said. You can always say no next time. If it\u2019s just not possible to do that and you actually have to get out for the sake of your sanity, it might be worth speaking to the artist and saying \u201chey I\u2019m really sorry but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m best placed here to help you achieve your goals\u201d depending on reasons why you could even recommend someone who might be a better fit (if the person is a total dick I absolutely would not do this)\n\nThat\u2019s really a last resort though. Powering through, learning from it (even just being able to spot these things before they start) and giving yourself the ability to swerve them in the future. \n\nCan I ask what the situation is and what\u2019s making you want to dump the project?\n\nEdit:\nI\u2019ve only ever had to \u2018fire\u2019 one client in my time (it may about to be two) the first time it honestly worked out better for everyone involved.",

Wants to throw away their entire fan base in rock music to do pop (which is pretty damn bold considering they have 2m followers on tiktok lol) and they told me they really want do the blinding lights thing. Which IMO is not a great idea as I think new artists making top 40 sounding tracks is kinda hard to pull off. And then you also have the fact that the whole 80s thing is feeling dated already. I think they need to go more indie since their voice suits the genre and their image won\u2019t have to be tweaked too much and there should be a solid crossover of current fans, but I ain\u2019t the artist here. So I just talked to them about it and told them I\u2019m gonna take a few extra days and make sure this feels right for the above reasons and if they hate it that\u2019s fine we\u2019ll try again until it\u2019s right.

I\u2019ve heard so many people in my family say they have no musical talent or they\u2019re terrible at piano, but they\u2019ve never practiced for 15 minutes. What\u2019s the measurable difference between Yo-Yo Ma and your uncle?\n\nMy gut feeling is that most of talent comes down to commitment/focus (interest in the craft) and learning styles, and then culture and early exposure mold that into an affinity.\n\nSome people will suck at an art form, put in the work, and then not suck anymore. Some will be born with a brain that\u2019s wired to seeing shapes, and find it easy to visualize patterns on a guitar neck. Some will be auditory learners and may find it easier to learn to identify intervals by ear.\n\nAnd then some people will grow up singing or playing in church, and those people get the cheat codes from a *very* young age while their brains are still spongey, learning things like their first language. Of course they weren\u2019t born playing the organ, but it can look that way from the outside.\n\nIt seems both mystical and defeatist when people who don\u2019t think they have talent talk about people who do\u2014almost like an excuse.

A close friend of mine is a modern Jazz Saxophonist, he said he once broke up with his band after an argument because he didn\u2019t want to play the melody but his band members were more traditional and wanted him to play the head. \n\nImo calling something not Jazz because they aren\u2019t doing the head-solo-head form is like calling modern classical music not classical music because of the aleatoric composition. Somewhat of a valid opinion, but not really. \n\nWould you call wayne shorter not a jazz musician because he writes scores for his band? (well\u2026 he\u2019s also a free jazz musician\u2026) \n\nFor general public, traditional jazz and traditional classical music would be more appealing to listen to for most people due to the predictability factor. Modern classical music and modern jazz is a movement to explore creative possibilities beyond that, but\u2026 it\u2019s often not done so tastefully because they step too far off the predictability.\n\nBut Jazz is a free form of expression. I think a lot of non-jazz musicians hate on Jazz because it\u2019s somewhat cerebral (it really isn\u2019t once you get past it\u2026 which I couldn\u2019t just yet), and a lot of people choose music because of its unexplainable magic people experience from it. It\u2019s only natural that the same people that was attracted to the unexplainable nature of music being turned off by the explainable nature of harmonies and rhythms. Jazz noobs and Berklee kids may make it look like that what Jazz is about and some have elitism behind it too, but that\u2019s not jazz. All the theory and stuff is a door you go through to be able to step into the world of self expression with an open form. (to be fair many old school jazz musicians solely played by ear with no knowledge in music theory. because\u2026 it all comes from their ears at the end of the day)\n\nWhether one wants to sit through someone expressing themselves is theirs to decide.",

And we as music makers are freed up enormously by working in headphones . I think rod waves album got a Grammy and was mixed on headphones iirc, perhaps it was a number 1 . Anyhoo , so I\u2019m not contesting the movement to headphone mixing , I\u2019m wondering for those who intend to or are doing all their work on headphones \u2026..how will you know how it feels in air ? As one day , the artist will perform it live . I come from club and sound system culture , so the ultimate destination is a wall of speaker boxes \u2026..and in the end music has to be re inforced for public performance . How do we know we ve got that balance right if we don\u2019t use speakers ? (Honest question )",

You\u2019ll need to change the security mode in the Startup Security Utility on the machine you are booting to Reduced Security, also just enable kernel extensions while you are there if you need for an interface like UAD etc.\n\nThis bootable OS will be specific to your Mac Model, as in, a m4 mbp installed external will not boot an m2 Mac mini or an m5 mbp etc. I\u2019m not sure if it needs to be the same specs, but that could easily be tested",
