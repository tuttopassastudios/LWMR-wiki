As somebody with a science background myself, my issue with Jon's claim is that its not rooted in any sort of methodical process. And now kids on the internet get fueled with the idea that one DAW might sound better than another -- instead of focusing on things that make far more of a difference in their productions/mixes/masters/etc.\n\nEDIT: I Have no doubt that if the same person mixed the same song in two different DAWs that they\u2019d come to very different results. But that\u2019s all inherent to the workflow, not to the physics or limitations of that particular DAW.",

    "content": "In the midst of a kinda unique side quest at the moment - label pulls me in at an hourly rate with an artist (and good friend) that I\u2019ve mixed for many times because the production sessions were such a mess that they felt like they couldn\u2019t even finish the records until some light mixing and organization took place. Songs spread out between multiple project files, DAWs, laptops\u2026vocals tracked to mp3s with the ~50ms delay thing\u2026Some of these producers templates\u2026brilliant stuff. Saw one vocal travel through maybe 7 or 8 auxes and hit probably 4 different rvox\u2019s along the way. It was like a labyrinth of signal flow that was nearly impossible to follow (and once I deleted half the auxes and waves plugins, it started to come back to life). In short they\u2019re having me un-mix it, hand it back for some more production, then do the final mixes later this year. A true testament to the importance of organization and more importantly minimalist, straight forward session files. I wonder how often this need comes up and how feasible it is to be involved ahead of the handoff as a mixer these days. And before you frown at me for griping, this is an absolutely incredible project, many insanely talented musicians I respect. Very right brained, free flowing group. So it felt cool to be able to play more of a part on the project as the more left brained participant and see the stress relief happen in real time.",

    "content": "I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner, but the closest parallel to the seismic shift of AI might be samples, even more so than things like digital recording or Pro Tools. When Hans Zimmer recorded an orchestra and started writing music with a DAW and showing clients mockups, nothing was ever the same. For a long time (even now!) the pencil-and-paper people griped about how it wasn't real composition. Orchestras feared that they would all be replaced by computers. But ultimately, everyone had to come to terms with the new world order and adapt. There was a period in the mid-90s through mid-late 2000s where orchestral writing was reduced to nothing more than long notes and short notes. All of the nuance was gone, because the tech couldn't handle it yet and people blamed the tech. Many mourned the loss of true orchestral writing, yearning for a by-gone era. \n\nBut eventually, people learned to harness these new tools and they met the technology on its own terms. People are doing wildly innovative things with samples now, we've moved completely past the era of \"can I make a convincing clarinet come out of my keyboard?\" Orchestras and live musicians have not been replaced. Sure, the process is different than it used to be, but that's how innovations work. All of us would be living very different lives without samples of drums, guitars, orchestras, synths, etc. There will be a generation coming up where AI is already a thing, they won't have ever lived in the before-times. Just like those here who've never cut to tape. It's okay.",

HOWEVER, that intro guitar tone, and only that intro guitar tone, was a direct mic on a tweed combo run through Audio Ease\u2019s Speakerphone plugin \ud83d\ude02. Sometimes fake works better than real. I needed the contrast between the intro, where he could bring it down to, and then where he was going by the end. That plug-in gave me the different color that sounded big, but didn\u2019t ruin the surprise of where the song was going to end up",

    "content": "This is something where you need to figure out your own path. There are certain rules you can go by, but if you're just starting out, I would forego metering and start wrapping your head around some reference tracks. If you're able, have another track (that you know translates well) that's in stylistic ballpark of the song you're working on play out of a separate set of inputs. If you can toggle between your mix and the reference on a monitor controller, this is the best. There's a plugin called Metric AB that you can put on your master buss that will help as well. Then set the level of your reference track to 0dBFS so it's playing back full volume, and try and work your mix up to that level of 'loudness'. You're not necessarily trying to ape the sonic characteristics of the reference, but it will help guide you in making decisions throughout the mix process that add to the overall sense of volume. This will be much more insightful than chasing a single LUFS value or having a bunch of analyzers.",

But his setup was just incredibly different than mine; he uses Studio One, I use pro tools (he\u2019s also used to Pro tools and recently bailed on it). He\u2019s using a combo of Antelope Discrete 8 and an Audient ASP880 and some good outboard pres (Vintech and Summit audio). His monitoring killed me, some small dynaudios which sounded okay and some ProAc\u2019s. He had some decent mics. I brought my 8 Channels of UTA and a bunch of mics and was there just to put our heads together, and I was going mostly press record so he could drum for his bands record.\n\nAnyway, we spent about 4+ hours trouble shooting Studio One, his computer, and the interfaces -eventually finding out one of his AD/DA channels was so messed up it sounded like a ribbon mic when it was a condenser. A lot of his mic stands and cables were really junky - he didn\u2019t have enough of the basics on his own.\n\nSo many things were just not working as I would expect - my UTA preamps were set at much lower gains than I do at my studio because of his gear. I\u2019m basically ear-blind because of the monitoring, even with headphones, and I\u2019m working in Studio One so I can barely focus on the sound. And he used a normal Apple mouse, I use a trackball. \n\nIm trying not to complain, but it just blew my mind how much of an uphill battle recording can be just because of simple things being so taxing. We spent about an hour of the 6 hours I was there tracking one song. The rest was setup. It made me realize why we put so much work into making our process simple and getting gear that is effective and reliable.",

It\u2019s completely remote, no set hours, salary/insurance, and I use Pro Tools for the gig so it\u2019s not completely foreign territory. Every remote gig is different and I realize this situation is a lot of luck and circumstance. Don\u2019t be discouraged to take another gig. I was able to pay off high interest cards and can comfortably afford gear when I want it. I was full time in the studio from age 14-31 no other job. It was a transition, but one I\u2019m glad I made. I\u2019m still working mixing full time as well. I do production if I\u2019m stoked on the project. I work with rock bands for context. Just do dope work try not to compare. Remember there are some people with mountains of gear and dope setups they own. much respect to that. Others have rich parents, high interest credit debt, or both. I told myself if I wasn\u2019t rolling in it with a Grammy at 30 I would stop which is a super dumb mindset. I love making records more than anything and getting another gig allows me to keep doing it. Rant over best of luck to everyone \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd",

Keep the metering out of sight.\n\nIt's worth keeping in mind that if they're new students they're also integrating a *lot* of new knowledge all at once. Not just the concept you're trying to teach (let's say compression, for example). \n\nNot only are they trying to understand the concept you're explaining, but they'll want to know how you opened up the plugin window, what the key command is, what plugin type you're choosing, what the exact name is, and what channel you're putting it on. They may be learning the software at the same time, which is a whole other mindset to juggle.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to clearly state what they should be focused on, and once they listen without using their eyes, then you can repeat it with the monitor on and show them *also* how to set up and use the tool. Reassure them that for now they can let go of trying to figure out the DAW (for example) and then you will double back around and demonstrate the implementation.",

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

Auto-tune artist has all this latency when recalled, even if it's on \"classic\" mode (which is low latency). In order to remove the latency, when opening an existing session, I have to open auto-tune, change the setting off classic and then back on. Then the latency returns to zero.\n\nA few other plugins just recently updated and work (Reaktor, some of the Neural DSP stuff). But that was for silicon native I think, not Sonoma.",

I move slowly and make sure I understand before I move on. It may take two months to complete, but I'm steady with it and I do a little bit most days. It's common for me to transcribe notes from high-density talks that I want to learn from and revisit them often over the span of a week. I'm constantly printing out my notes and reading material so that they're easy to revisit throughout the week.\n\nI'm currently taking a project management course through MIT, which has been great. It's uncommon for me to do formal schooling these days, but this is work related and a direct application to my future capabilities that we thought would be beneficial for the company.\n\nWhen I buy a new plugin (rare) I set aside time to go through it and turn every knob and try each feature to see what it's capable of. Learning a tool on the spot is a good way to kill the creative flow, so I do the exploration up-front when possible.\n\nOften I'll have ideas for novel ways to use a tool (layering distortion, for example) and I'll set aside two hours to explore it and see what I find.\n\nThat said, I think my day-to-day may be quite different from a lot of folks here. My eggs aren't all in the business and pressures of record production, and so I rarely find myself buried in such commitments. I tend to keep \"normal\" business hours these days and keep a hard separation between my commitments and my leisure.\n\nIn fact I'd say that I'm actively structuring my life so that I can retain my leisure and don't find myself overwhelmed with commitments.

    "content": "My main tip for using Live live is try and replace as many third party plugins as you possibly can with stock, freeze as much as you can, and most of the latency you experience is going to be coming from internal delay compensation vs I/O latency.  If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

That'll make you sweat bullets for sure. Been there.\n\nAlso *yes* to the Daniel Mintseris Ableton live set videos.

When doing it this way MD  stand-alone has the edge over the plug-in because it\u2019s all right there in front of me. It\u2019s easy to visually reference a quad tracked lead vocal, and then align and de ess or consonant 8 harmonies. That\u2019s where the stand-alone really shines, is massively dense stacks vocals like that, and not having to keep opening up a plug-in to change a different part or vibrato or formant of a particular track  of the stack or what not. Especially once you get the groove locked in on the lead, it\u2019s just so easy to make all other 30 tracks lock in with it. \n\nFor a solo vocal soul song? I\u2019m probably just audio suiting AT in graph mode in PT. It ultimately sounds the best.",

Mixing is another story\u2014in the (increasingly) rare instance when I'm mixing on a console, I'll figure out some way of recalling for that particular project. This is usually more or less @Rollmottle's method, except I go even more jank-ass and just scribble song names on a post-it and hold it in front of a piece of gear like a mugshot. Anything on the console is either stored in the console automation, or, like the most recent project I mixed on a console, I'll just calibrate all the faders and run stuff through it, but really *mix* in Pro Tools still. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

    "content": "That's super annoying. But being honest, I do see the reason that plug-in manufacturers would want a system like this, especially a company that's been doing it as long as Waves. If you bought a Waves plugin 15 years ago, how long are they expected to provide support for the one time purchase? Given that operating systems and DAW updates are always going to provide a moving target, it doesn't seem unreasonable to have some sort of upgrade fee or plan for them to cover their costs in the development of updated software. I just think with Waves, their whole pricing model is on drugs and it's hard to attain any semblance of sanity from their upgrade plans.",

    "content": "@cian riordan yeah i agree, especially with the 15 year thing. The update plans are annual now though, so it would have to be renewed annually if your OS was being updated with each release ( at least from my experience). I ran into that issues after one or two years with those plugins. But honestly I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m really happy with the plugins I\u2019ve subbed in to replace what I used in the past. My main tools are the MCDSP channel strip, some fabfilter plugins, soundtoys bundle, UAD, and a few other things here and there. I think Waves marketing convinced me to buy tools I really didn\u2019t need. But as a beginner at the time, plugin manufacturers can be pretty deceiptful in their marking strategy in my opinion. It wasn\u2019t until after buying a bunch of different things, that I realized what tools I truly needed long term.",

I can always HDMI I figure if I need the extra real estate.\n\nThe only acustica plug I run regularly is Ruby 2 - seems to cause pretty drastic spikes on the CPU short term in Ableton (running rosetta mode and VST3 by the way) but then it levels out.  In general I've been super impressed with the performance vs my desktop.  I'd say for my mixes it runs maybe 80% as well on large projects (75+ tracks, lots of processing) which was more than I was expecting.  Smaller projects and productions and softsynths it absolutely chews through compared to my desktop.\n\nWas just trying out a little mix in Studio One just on the 14\" and it felt very cramped to me.  I think it'd be hard to completely mix at this resolution but again it probably has more to do with what I'm used to.  Would definitely recommend a separate display if you are going to be doing all your work on it.",

So if you like easy grid based edits of overdubs etc it gets a little more complicated than usual . I wasted a bit of time trying to work out the problem then slaving the mpc to daw MTC which then just removes the mpc swing which is counterproductive . So yeah , if at any point it\u2019s gonna be tracked into the daw familiarise and strategise for that asap in the process .",

    "content": "I can understand the trepidation here. Now that Canva own Affinity, it's not yet clear what their strategy is. My guess is that there are a few reasons for this play:\n\n1. Affinity Studio is now a loss leader for Canva's other offerings, like their (just announced) supplemental AI tool set or their enterprise plans, which I suspect are a big portion of their income compared to their Affinity suite licenses.\n\n2. It eats into Adobe's market share. Making a very competitive alternative to Adobe's flagship software and then offering it for free encourages adoption by users who are ready to jump ship from their Adobe subscriptions or who need software like this and are fine without Adobe's cutting-edge tools (like me).\n\nThere are some positive examples of high-level *free* software that is continues to thrive with no sign of being abandoned, or compromised. Like DaVinci Resolve or Reaper (which is effectively free). There are also some great examples of open source software getting a new lease on life by their steward companies. Namely Musescore and Audacity's recent revamps. \n\nNow Affinity isn't open source, but Musegroup have a large full-time development team that seem to be getting by just fine developing what is effectively free software. If they can do it, then Affinity likely can.\n\nHere's hoping Canva have done the math right before setting out on this course.",

You'll likely get better sonic results if you can find a room with some more volume... that will also allow you to play with position in front of the microphone. As far as the level you should record at, if you've got any half-decent mic pre than you can go into the computer pretty conservatively. Assuming you don't have a super noisy chain, there'll be plenty of headroom in a 24 bit recording to bring it up after the fact. If you're looking for numbers, I'd shoot to get things into your DAW at around -18 dBFS. Many of the plugins modeled after analog gear tend to be happier with that level (or less if you're unsure).",

    "content": "I wanna second the Fabfilter Pro-Q3. If you're just beginning, I wouldn't worry *too* much about having it because it sounds functionally identical to the stock Ableton EQ and $200 may be a high startup cost at that point. That said, It is my most used plugin and where it really excels are the speed and ergonomics of it's layout. When you're trying to move quick through a session, it really really pays off with the amount of friction that it takes out of my workflow. It's incredibly intuitive for me.",

    "content": "Anyway: uncompressed PCM audio (.wav and .aiff) is made up of digital words generally 16 or 24 bits long recorded however many times a second for a given sample rate, for fixed point (integer) values. Each bit represents ~6dB of dynamic range. Every time you go up in level 6dB from that particular sample point, another bit flips from 0 (off) to 1 (on). The least significant bit defines your noise floor, so 16 bit audio has 96dB of dynamic range at maximum from noise floor to full scale (every bit turned on). Seems simple enough, right? And it isn't super complicated. But it has one problem: you run out of dynamic range real quick if you're changing levels with (virtual) faders at 24 bits. There are two ways around that:\n1, make the mixer engine run on a much higher integer word length (like old Pro Tools HD systems, which use 48 bit integer), and the mixer automatically converts the audio (if anything is done to it, including fader moves) to 48 bit. Think of this as adding more digits to the fractions side of a decimal point. \n2, make the mixer engine run on a floating point system (almost every other DAW, including more modern versions of Pro Tools) - that is, you move *where the decimal point is* . 32 bit float effectively works as 24 bits that can be moved around more or less with impunity, up or down.",

I currently have a separate production/writing template and then another for mixing but I\u2019m trying to hybridise and streamline them a little more to get faster results and hopefully focus on the song. Also, most of the songs I mix tend to be one\u2019s I\u2019ve written and produced as well, so hoping to cut down on session set-up time.\n\nSome of mine are an instant \u201cduck bus\u201d, which I picked up from Ian Kirkpatrick. It\u2019s a pre-loaded aux with something like LFO Tool or shaper box on it, so you can quickly route and uniformly make things side chain.\n\nAnother quick workflow thing I love is having Pro Tools audio playlists with a bunch of reverse sweeps, impacts and other transition fx/ear candy hidden and ready to go in the session, so you can quickly try out a bunch. \n\nI also have the trim plugin added as the first and last plugin on every new track preset, as I use them to quickly manage the gain in and out of each track and so I don\u2019t have to search for them constantly.\n\nOzone Spectral shaper on some music busses and as a replacement for Soothe on the mix bus has also been a real win (thanks Jon!) Although these sorta things aren\u2019t turned on whilst writing as they have a ton of latency.\n\nKeen to hear what you all find useful!",

The best way to practice is to literally do it as often as possible even if it's by yourself. You won't train the social aspect, you won't really train problem solving of an external source (a guitarist with a particularly shitty amp or playing technique per-say), but you can certainly experiment endlessly on capturing sounds. Shootouts, micing techinques, it's pretty much endless. If you don't have a recording setup at home or are in an apartment where you can't be as loud as you'd want, I try to absorb as much information as I can. Podcasts (Andrew Talks to Awesome People / Unstoppable Recording Machine / Working Class Audio / Conversations Audio), Online articles, (Sound on Sound) GearSpace Forum Q+A, TapeOp interviews, Youtube Series (Making Records with EV, Sounds-Like-a-Drum), etc. These can be incredibly inspiring and keep your mind tuned into the recording process.  I sort of use this as my \"fix\" when I am not able to work actively on a project. Otherwise, what everyone else has said about mixing are perfect suggestions. Maybe set limitations like only using plugins you haven't used. or remove a plugin you are constantly using to force yourself out of a habit. Practice editing dramatically even if the track doesn't call for it so you can get your editing chops up.",

That was exactly what I thought when exploring the AI DAW that Ruairi posted last night. \"How is this any different than what we already do?\" In both cases you still need to specify exactly what you want.

Whatever shape the future of recorded music takes it seems that there's still likely to be artisans steering the ship.

No need to run a billion instances of serum or anything like that but I do have a lot of plugins running most of the time and it\u2019d be nice not to feel like my computers about to blow up.

Some of these plugins will cause massive latency beyond the audio driver and I can't use them while playing notes in with virtual instruments. \n\nAlso...  direct monitoring is always key for acoustic instruments and the experience is near zero, so the original point wouldn't apply there (correct?)",

    "content": "With credits, is there a general consensus or definition on the distinction between  \"producer\" and \"additional production\" or is it always a case by case thing? Had a song I worked on (finished the production and did the mix) come out today. At the beginning of the project I had asked to be listed as a producer and mixer but realized when it came out, that the artist had listed himself as the producer and me as additional production/instrumentation, and mixer. The artist is a really good and longtime friend and I am going to just talk to him and ask that he fixes the credits (and will start making written agreements before all of my projects) but I am curious if there is any broader context that could help how I approach the conversation? \n\nNot super critical to the main question but here are some specifics of my situation: Artist wrote the song, and recorded some basic tracks (drums, vox, guitar). We then worked on it in my studio and I played more instruments (bass, guitars, keys, lap, steel, percussion). We then finished it remotely a few months later. Sent the Ableton production session back and forth a few times times and then I prepped and exported the files myself and mixed it in Protools. And I had to do what I would consider a fair amount of heavy lifting in the mix: song was pretty complicated and recorded at home so I ended up do doing a lot of clean up, some tuning, and a lot of sound shaping and effects. All that to say, this case feels pretty cut and dried but I am curious to know what types of work would appropriately fall under \u201cadditional production\u201d and what is standard in the industry.

I have several packs of their models and they sound absolutely fantastic. Although they do have some kinks to work out (website and overall organization in a mess, plugin is buggy at the moment and very cpu heavy) but several updates are incoming imminently including one that will run the plug off of the gpu allowing many more instances. They do offer a 14 day trial that includes some free profiles to evaluate which I\u2019d recommend to anyone curious about where the technology is going\n\nhttps://analogxai.company.site/",

    "content": "Hear me out guys what if we took Waves, NI, UAD, and mayyybee Steven Slate, threw them in a room with Big Plug-In to negotiate opaque blanket licensing terms for a subscription service where we can pay $10 / month for every plug in ever made, or to be made, and the devs are paid out pro rata style based off relative use. Pretty soon the network effect will bring in all the indie devs and we\u2019ll never have to pay $200 for a plugin again!",

    "content": "My only gripe with plugins is the marketing and how its pushed out. It could cost whatever. I own every uad, every MAAT, every ridiculously priced plugin you could think of.\n\nI like DMG, FF, Xfer etc (I can't name all) where its just there, there's the price and it sells. (Yes I know, business etc..) But when you spam my inbox with mixbustv calling every plugin a game changer... and I have to buy it because a project comes in where someone bought it because *game changer*.... idk mixed feelings.",
