    "content": "About a week ago I was in here moping about how I had like one thing on the calendar for the entire month and it was freaking me out. you guys had really great feedback, and @Josh Bowman compared it to walking on an invisible path in Mario which is so spot on. It ended up being a major positive because I was able to say yes to several things that came up since (which included two of the coolest opportunities I\u2019ve had all year, one with producing for a new fav artist of mine and the other with a band I listened to a ton as a kid). And everyone was so glad I was able to be as flexible as I was and make things happen with full dedication at short notice. \n\nAll in all, hitting those scary moments where you\u2019re broke and unbooked can be a rock solid motivator, and somehow yet again the universe is looking out for me.

    "content": "Ok Long Post alert, but touches on a few things we harp on around here. \n\nSo my little bro is in town- we made dinner for one of his oldest friends who just moved to town with his wife. He\u2019s a fantastic mandolin player and his wife is a singer/songwriter. \n\nOf course I did the ol\u2019 studio walk through, listening to all the tunes on the ear calibration playlist, then let them play some of their own favs. Of course they\u2019re blown away and have never heard music like this etc. \n\nBut to drive the point home I show them a song @Rollmottle and I turned around in just over 24 hours. \u201cThe reason for the speakers & treatment etc is so we can make decisions quickly blah blah blah.\u201d  I pull up the session and we listen through and they\u2019re loving it- but I\u2019m noticing it doesn\u2019t have the 3D thing that all the other music we\u2019ve been listening to has. \n\nThen I show them the mastered version. An mp3. It\u2019s louder and better sounding and all, until the first BGV stack hits\u2026 then it\u2019s IMMERSIVE. We listened to the whole thing again just to enjoy the magic and notice all the ways the master improved it. So far beyond zapping resonances and making it loud, @Rollmottle made it sound\u2026 important. Made *me* sound like a good mixer. \n\nIt was heavier lifting for him cause I didn\u2019t have the benefit of time for fresh ears or to detail the vocal the way I normally would. Also had the good fortune of having @Ross Fortune on speed dial and on GMT to give it a listen at 5am PST. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re curious, or dubious, I\u2019ll DM files so you can hear what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nTL;DR: monitoring matters, fresh perspective matters. Don\u2019t produce mix *and* master your own shit.",

    "content": "God I love this discord. \nTo me 90% of the reason big producers are paying many thousands a day to be in a studio the past 15-20 years is to just not have to worry about shit. Anyone can make a record at home these days; part of being in an \u201cactual\u201d studio is the cocoon of creativity. If the assistant takes more than a couple of minutes to patch anything in, bring up the piano, or recommend the best Thai place in town, they\u2019re blowing it. I had an assistant once at this place famous for making cookies on site, bring me my normal plate of cookies I always ask for and while I was comping I ate half of one, put it back on the plate, and continued working. He didn\u2019t say a word, got up, grabbed the plate, and disappeared for a few minutes and came back. \u201cHey man, I know you normally house the entire plate of cookies so when you put that one back I checked with the kitchen and last week I guess they changed the cookie recipe, and they\u2019re gonna make em like they used to for you.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I asked for that dude every session after, less for the cookies but more for the insane attention to detail and telepathy. One of max\u2019s engineers started as a Conway assistant, and as good of an engineer as he was he also prepped the best Hookahs and was just a great hang. Max ended up hiring him for his own studio. We\u2019re in a people business, try to be attentive and a good person to have around, for all the reasons that go beyond knowing how to set an attack on an 1176. \n\nThe flip side is, if you\u2019re booking a studio as a producer, the assistants are what really make the studio run. Treat them well. Know their names. Give them credit. No assistant on any session I ever did paid for their own meal, they got what the artist got.  They most of the time got engineer credits. Help them along. As with all things, mutual respect goes a long way.",

We'll practice things for years that you wouldn't consider investing an hour in. You can imagine spending half of your life under a bridge learning to play sax like Sonny Rollins, but you can't imagine spending five minutes learning to drop a palmed cell phone into a little pocket behind a cardboard cut out of Chris Angel while hanging across around its neck and talking a mile a minute without the slightest pause. I had to practice that a lot. A lot more than you can imagine. I had to practice it a lot more than you think it's worth. Our big secret is that it's worth more to us to do our tricks then you can even imagine. Our deep secret is simply misplaced priorities.\"",

    "content": "Ok Tl;dr- where you are matters as much as who you are. \n\nI\u2019m also from a small town, moved to LA trying to get famous and got my ass handed to me by artists who were better looking & more talented and yet were still struggling to be seen. But I kept at it because I\u2019m tenacious, (read: delusional, as all artists must be.)\n\nI was able to work *for* some of those artists cause I had a diverse skillset, and I was full time music after about 4 years, by the time I was 26. Doing gigs at hotels and playing guitar or recording for other people, teaching guitar, leading music at churches, all the while pouring evening last ounce of money & energy into my artist career, until my last real artist project broke up the week we were supposed to sign our first record deal. I was 36. \n\nThat\u2019s when I moved to Nashville and really gave myself over to music directing and producing and writing for other artists. I did it as a consolation while I regrouped to find my next thing, but for some reason, when I made the move all the sudden my whole career made sense to me. \n\nAs it turns out, my real joy comes not from the sound of my own voice, but from helping others find theirs. When I acquiesced to that very real, very culturally counterintuitive calling, I thrived. \n\nAll the sudden I was playing music with and for a bunch of my heroes, and all my friends who were artists starting getting famous. And (shocker) I was really glad I wasn\u2019t one of them. \n\nI always thought that my calling was to help people feel less alone in the world, and that the music I made was the vehicle for that calling. In the end, it turns out it was the relationships i built through music that were the real vehicle.  \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out who I was, and the cities I was in played a huge role in that story. Nashville built its whole industry on people who want to *help* artists, not just *be* artists. \n\nI miss LA every day but I\u2019m in the right place. So, my friend, where is the right place for you?",

Having only experienced studio work as a cottage industry up to that point, PP opened my eyes to avenues I could pursue that I wouldn\u2019t have known even existed otherwise (recording engineer is different to mixing engineer is different to producer is different to songwriter??!). It all seems very rudimentary now, but I was starting from literally nothing in a place with few (if any?) visible role models.\n\nI learned so much from it on a technical level - from basic stuff like what a Pultec is and how people use it (connecting the dots between my cracked Waves bundle - Puigtec and who tf JJP was), what \u201ca vocal chain\u201d might look like and the purpose of each stage\u2026\n\nTrue, the interviews did become unbearable, but there was a golden era between eps around 30-90 at a time when outside of working in the studio world, there weren\u2019t many other sources of good information from people who were really doing it.\n\nHuge appreciation for Dave, and I hope he and his family get the support they need.",

    "content": "Ok I'm gonna go in depth about this because I think it's FASCINATING.\n\nThe top three songs have an overlapping core fanbase that is largely unrepresented (or maligned) in popular culture: the white working class.\n\nBut none of them are really straightforward \"country.\" \n\nThe first song is a viral hit that seemingly comes from an authentic Appalachian kid talking about class. Despite his very explicit statements about hating political division, it has of course been wildly politicized because everything on the internet is these days.\n\nThe second song is a white male country singer covering a black lesbian female's iconic song ALSO about class. Talk about intersectionality...\n\nThe third song is the longest running solo male #1 song on the Hot 100 from the biggest star in country music (and really one of the biggest stars in the world... just, again, not covered by the current fashion of mainstream culture). It's a kinda-country-but-kinda-just-pop song co-written by the biggest country writer in history (Ashley Gorley) as well as once-rapper-and-Dr-luke-protege J Kash.\n\nThe rest of the chart is interesting too. #4 is a four year old taylor swift song that has gained traction online from her current tour so the label started pushing it as a single. \n\nThere are two Olivia Rodrigo songs, signaling a true new superstar.\n\nThere are two songs from the Barbie soundtrack. In a \"dying\" movie industry currently on strike, when is the last time two songs from a movie soundtrack have been in the top 10? I dunno.\n\nAnd lastly, there's only 1 trap song. The majority of these songs are people playing real instruments and writing more \"classic\" singer-songwriter songs. Rap music is really having a lull after a decade of dominance.",

    "content": "I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner, but the closest parallel to the seismic shift of AI might be samples, even more so than things like digital recording or Pro Tools. When Hans Zimmer recorded an orchestra and started writing music with a DAW and showing clients mockups, nothing was ever the same. For a long time (even now!) the pencil-and-paper people griped about how it wasn't real composition. Orchestras feared that they would all be replaced by computers. But ultimately, everyone had to come to terms with the new world order and adapt. There was a period in the mid-90s through mid-late 2000s where orchestral writing was reduced to nothing more than long notes and short notes. All of the nuance was gone, because the tech couldn't handle it yet and people blamed the tech. Many mourned the loss of true orchestral writing, yearning for a by-gone era. \n\nBut eventually, people learned to harness these new tools and they met the technology on its own terms. People are doing wildly innovative things with samples now, we've moved completely past the era of \"can I make a convincing clarinet come out of my keyboard?\" Orchestras and live musicians have not been replaced. Sure, the process is different than it used to be, but that's how innovations work. All of us would be living very different lives without samples of drums, guitars, orchestras, synths, etc. There will be a generation coming up where AI is already a thing, they won't have ever lived in the before-times. Just like those here who've never cut to tape. It's okay.",

Artists wanted more takes but basically got bullied out of the room. \n2) The artist wanted to be there for the comp at least, producer refused. As I said, first time he heard it was after first mix pass. \n3) producer baked some Sonics into the vocal that were very outside for the artist, and there were bad edits & poor Melodyne work to boot. \n\n\nNow not only is the mixer gonna have to mix the vocals all over again (we\u2019re retracking,) but all the other shit I\u2019m adding/changing. \n\nSo this producer made the artist uncomfortable and then made more work for everyone, on a major label budget. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna speculate on the why, but there are some lessons here.",

Everybody tells me the producer/band leader is this prolific asshole, constantly blowing up at people and impossible to please. The previous mixer had been mixing this thing for months/over a year and everyone was worn out/not getting results. I was really reluctant to take on the project for fear of being intimidated/failing to deliver.\n\nI've made a point of greeting the producer at every step with clear communication, enthusiasm, and an open mind. I genuinely love the music and have made a point of letting him know how much fun it's been to work on the stuff. And, similar to your story, we were basically approved on the first track within 4 mixes and the guy seemed really really happy.\n\nEveryone just said this guy was a hopeless asshole, but what I saw was a guy who was working so hard to bring a vision to life and just struggling to get there; self-financing, overseeing everything, etc... and it's fairly complex, hip hop and soul vibes with practically a full orchestra and 3 vocalists, so it's a lot to manage. Not trying to excuse the asshole behavior, but I see the frustration and I really wanted to highlight how much cool work he had done and that, without any fuss or needless back and forth, we would just get it where it needed to go. i tried to just think about how exciting it could be to finally hear these songs that've been bouncing around in his head actually come out of the speaker the way he imagined. We've got 7 songs almost done now and I've grown so much just from these attitude alignments i've picked up from spending time here.",

Had a client reach out with a tight 2 day deadline right ahead of a move and I passed politely and recommended another engineer who said yes then bailed on the project 24 hours later It was my word so I jumped in and hired my other friend to split the fee with me and we got a royal amount of editing done in 24 hours and I got my client hooked up and happy.

But I had my first 3-4 things that started getting attention get taken away from me by managers/ labels/ bigger producers/ bigger mixers. Once I got to that next level it was obvious why I wasn't the guy yet. But if you're working on things that are at some point getting out there in a real way, that's the place that most people are before they jump up. \n\nSome of it is opportunity, some of it is skillset, some of it is time management (if you're hustling, it helps to turn great shit around before everyone else), and some of it is just the intangibles that come from more reps. \n\nMy One Direction song came out 17 years after I first recorded the first band I was in.

It would give me tremendous sway over the music industry once everyone comes to recognize that I can't miss. I would leverage that influence to make some positive changes where I can. Set up some institutions to cultivate and nurture the next generation of artists. \n\nPresumably, while the hit music I\u2019m making runs counter to my personal tastes, it seems reasonable that it would still be valuable to *someone*. Just not to me. That will be my curse. I would dutifully churn out hits as fast as I am able to and gift humanity with a tsunami of unimpeachable pop awesomeness that will endure for a century. My sacrifice would be everyone else\u2019s gain.\n\nCounter-intuitively, by saturating the market with my personal brand of songwriting it would inspire the next generation of songwriters. Unable to compete with my torrent of sure-shot pop badness they would respond by writing new music that is the direct antithesis of my own brand of hits. With a little luck, the musical output of these writers would be exactly what I wished to hear all along.\n\nThat\u2019s a win/win right there. I just have to suffer a bit. I choose *Option #1*.",

Makes a HUGE difference in not just your speed,  but also how intuitively you tune once switching tools becomes easy and reflexive.",

I also liked what he had to say on the information he's unintentionally prescribed in past live videos and the Peter Attia quote -- many times i've wondered if a new engineer hears \"I don't compress\" wihtout any context and goes ok, compression is cancelled, but really that was a thing specific to Jon's brain at that time. though yea, a lot of people could get away with compressing *less* lol",

    "content": "Sonic consistency amongst songs on a record is one of those things that gets harder as you move further through the production processes. In an ideal world, you'd map out an aesthetic for a record in pre-production and make choices in recording & production to try and stay within those lines, whatever that means. A real world example I have is when I was doing the last Mini Mansions album, we locked onto a few H3000 patches that sort of defined how the drums and ambience would sound throughout the record. We obviously didn't use it on everything, but it helped thread the needle through a wildly diverse batch of songs. After that, having one person mix the whole album will undoubtedly help tie together a record that's been all over the map in production -- be it different styles or producers. As someone that often is tasked with doing this, I am always referencing other songs in the album to try and make sure things are sounding 'consistent'. By the time mastering comes, everything should sound 99% complete.",

And there may also be a master side royalty for the artist, but that depends on a lot of factors and is negotiable either way.\n\nTwo examples:\nWe had Rich The Kid feature on a song I did. The original had 3 writers. Rich did his verse and ad libs and sent the files. Since he was signed to the same publisher, he did it for $5k and 15% of pub.\n\nWhen Kendrick featured on Sia \"The Greatest\", I don't know what he took on pub (likely would be more than 15% but not too much) but his fee was $250k.",

This would be being the new wave . It\u2019s vital in uk street music to be a creator of the wave / up on the new wave .....to garner attention . This dates back to jungle....where the producer/engineers were pioneering completely new sounds and rhythms via sampler technology midi and sampled breakbeats (amen , funky drummer etc ) . When a snare backbeat transitions from the use of a snare to instead a rimshot......or a particular clap sample.....and that track blows up, the wave moves . If you a year later release a track with the old snare on the backbeat instead of the rim .....that\u2019s dated . The same goes for the other percussions, the bass sounds (eg 808 / Moog in intro/bridge combi ) .....and the patterns . So this is why In twelve months most of the productions these artists are dithering over , will be out of date. It\u2019s just silly imo. Music is moving so fast and is ultimately so disposable at the mo holding onto it like some sort of special Tolkien esque ring is really just a vanity. Personally I\u2019d venture this is also the essence of what makes pop music trends discernible . That\u2019s just my opinion tho with respect to these genres. My overall goal is to record and mix work like rumours. Smokey , earthy and nourishing . A bit like @popaganda.  s last work .\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Totally understand the hesitation to delegate - especially that first 6 months-a year where you're acutely aware that helping someone else do it is *more work* than just rolling up your sleeves and doing it yourself. \n\nFor building systems, what's worked for me is hiring and training your 'double(s)' first - someone with a similar skillset and sensibilities, very broad skills like me (who also did everything myself for a long time). This comes a lot easier if you have close friends in the same lane looking for jobs, I've seen people have their \"double(s)\" move in with them for a limited time too, with the intention of them soaking in exactly all you do.\n\nOnce my double(s) started doing pretty well, we started hiring more specialized people, and the doubles could then oversee their work, feedback etc - early on I would always be part of this, then slowly phase myself out.\n\nWhat I wish I would have done earlier would have been to hire a producer/overseer/manager/'my boss' - someone with a bit more skin in the game/responsibility, and who keeps you in line if you start wavering. \n\nAgain, I didn't love the setup of 10 and dissolved it eventually - as a creative it's easy to feel like you built a house/efficiency machine and one day you wake up and it's a prison that's not as flexible as you want. That's another thing I'm trying to keep in mind (I'm putting together a new similar team for this fall) - how do you keep the team agile and ready to shift when priorities shift? It could be as easy as accepting a little bit more churn & letting people go when they don't fit what's going on, but it's hard to let go of people you've trained and know well. I felt a friendship connection with my entire team, in hindsight I think that was a mistake too.\n\nThose are some thoughts haha - what have you found so far? Are you experiences lining up with mine? What kind of roles are you hiring for?",

(Assuming, you can already hum a melody on the spot and are not tone deaf) \n\nI wouldnt worry too much about theory and super correct technique. \n\nThe best Way to get anywhere on an instrument is by Playing it, and doing in consistently. Set some realistic goals and just get going, vocabulary and technique Will come naturally if you just keep Playing. \n\nFuck Playing scales and inversions and all that for now. \nJust go learn a metric ton of songs and melodies and learn to play them together. Do it by Ear. It Will be tough in the beginning, but you Will get very decent quickly if you just do the most important Thing, which is being consistent.\n\nI would reccomend setting a low minimum to do everyday to keep a realistic goal that you can keep, rather than a higher on you miss every now and then. You can always add more practice but it sucks to miss out on it.\n\nStart with song you want to Sound like and then you can slowly branch out when the style become second Nature for you. \n\nSadly there are no tricks or hacks or whatever youtube wants you to beleive to get their clicks. Its all about muscle memory and developing your ears together. And not to Sound like 4 bar loop, but consistency, and do it a lot. I cannot stress that enough. \u2764\ufe0f",

Really taking the time to feel the physicality of it and how my body responds. Honing in on the sound and loosening up. I'm also playing more bass and focusing on the sensations and the tone and the articulation in a way that I've neglected for a while. Now I'm enjoying playing and singing together and practicing that with no expectations. I say this as someone who has never considered themselves to be a singer/songwriter. I'm really enjoying it.\n\nThe whole project is tied in with my mindfulness practice, and I'm loving the feeling of being unburdened by the need to write and deliver.",

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

The highest achievement, future funding, drawing in more talent, etc... might all come down to the performance of the group. Would it then be wise to be so laissez-faire about undermining the intrinsic motivation / confidence of others? What if an unintended consequence of that attitude is less actual human connection?\n\nLast thought I had is how do we know the truth of someone else's potential?

First of all, great record / artist. I checked out his Spotify and saw that he had no music out before this album. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but my understanding is that he got some tik tok traction then went on the road with Zach Bryan before any of his stuff was out? Was so stoked to see the amount of excitement around an artist\u2019s first release (which is so sick that his first release was an album as well). This might be a hot take, but I think I\u2019m a pretty big fan of the way tik tok has impacted music discovery. Obviously it\u2019s not perfect or going to satisfy everyone, but it\u2019s pretty awesome that all the doors are wide open. And I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a bigger interest in songs, writing, lyrics, etc. From what I\u2019ve heard, it sounds like people got to know some of these Joshua Slone songs well enough to be singing along at his live shows, and I would dare to attribute that to the fact that his lyrics are literally on the screen in his videos.

Making a career in the music industry is what engineers would call a \"wicked\" problem. It's not something that has a repeatable solution, and what works for someone rarely works the same way for the next person.\n\nThat said, I see that you\u2019re from Boston. I lived there for seven years, and the talent pool in that city is tremendous. I think if you found yourself back home in Boston it would be a worthwhile investment to integrate yourself into the scene of young musicians that are centered around the schools in the Back Bay like Berklee, NEC, and Boston Conservatory. There are some immensely talented, diverse, and creative people from all around the world based at those institutions and they all exist within 8 blocks of each other. It\u2019s rare to have such a concentration of driven musicians all mingling amongst each other. This is a massive resource that you can tap into. They're *all* trying to make something great and explore what's possible.\n\nIt's a unique opportunity to discover collaborators, build relationships, earn experience in your craft, and build strong connections for the future as you grow alongside these people. On top of that, Boston has numerous recording studios where you can intern and assist. There\u2019s a lot of experience to be gained working in a studio that simply won\u2019t be taught to you in a recording program. Supplement that practical experience with hard work, and some book learning and you can do very well for yourself.\n\nThere\u2019s more that I\u2019m not touching-on, but I think if you ended up back in Boston it not be as much as a trade-off as you may think.",

The producer, lead singer/songwriter, guitar dude who is clearly leading the charge creatively, a manager, etc. etc. who you can turn to in order to give definitive direction... maybe during covid this is more difficult as I feel that often can become clear organically in the room.\n\nIf it\u2019s truly a situation where there are contradictory/unproductive notes coming in, maybe either a) tell them they need to decide amongst themselves and then give you a clear list of notes, or b) take the lead yourself and really push for what you feel serves the song best/explain why the sax can\u2019t be 10x louder than the lead vocal? Which option is best I\u2019d say depends on your relationship with them, how much of a lead you want to take creatively, how confident you are in making the right choices for this song, etc. etc.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @cian riordan might have better advise for these situations!",

    "content": "Yes. The same way you do anything in life you want to get good at. Spend a shit load of time doing that thing. There really are no hacks or work arounds if you want to actually get good. An easy free way to do it is just learn as many songs as you can. If you want to really be proficient in the musical language I would recommend learning stuff by ear. It takes a lot longer than looking up tutorials or sheet music. But I promise you will develop your ears infinitely more. Specially in the beginning. Music is a language. Every human being learns to speak and converse before they learn how to spell and know the rules of grammar. Learning theory will only let you put names to sounds so that you can convey musical ideas to their people. Contrary to what a lot of people think, there are no rules, but there are a lot of conventions and traditions, but they keep changing and have lots of exceptions. Learning a shit ton of songs on whatever instrument you choose, will teach you what those conventions are and how to use them. \n\nIn the beginning it\u2019s good to just learn every song you like as well as you can, because it will help keep you motivated as you like the music. Then after a while you will probably want to branch out and try stuff you\u2019ve never listened to or enjoyed before just to challenge yourself. \n\nThe most musical people I know, are the people who wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a Caugmented#9 but can listen to a song once and play it nearly perfectly, because their ears and musical language is so developed from playing a fuck lot of music and not spending time reading about it or watching endless tutorials.",

My theory is that the biggest negative impact was caused by label execs trying to monetize the platform and doing a poor job of it. Making \u201cviral\u201d really the only barrier for entry, and trying to view things made off that platform as only viable if it would work ON it. \n\nIn truth I think some real artists have come from TikTok, and some of the trends, like the drop (not new I know,) and the 30 second edit, are great tools for songwriting.",

For lyrics, I have mostly done \u201cjournal entry\u201d per day to amass tons of material to pick through later. I realized years later that almost all my completed songs with lyrics came from those bits of writing so I think I need to go back to that! (I don\u2019t write lyrics a lot anymore).\n\nFor the music aspect, I relied heavily on just pure instinct / jam it out for so many years, but working on commercial music made me start to set a lot more intention in my writing which helped immensely in all aspects. I guess my favorite thing is mostly to try to write a fully structured song in a day (4-5 times a week). The limitation of a day gives me enough flexibility to actually create and record an entire track while also not getting TOO hung up on writing a verse, chorus, bridge, etc. there\u2019s no time to overthink!",

Also, I\u2019m weird in my songwriting style apparently as I write lyrics first with a melody and then record an acapella demo to voice notes on my phone and then work on the music side of things later and often with someone else as I struggle with writing the actual music part of songs. \n\nI like that you mentioned jamming and not overthinking on structure! Some of my favourite songs don\u2019t have the classic pop song structure that all the top 40 songs seem to have and even looking at bands like The White Stripes where their biggest hits didn\u2019t even have a chorus (Seven Nation Army & Icky Thump) and those are great songs!!",

Imagine this tech in a DAW - move a chord change, or a section, and all of the bits that would need to be adjusted to make it feel natural just happen automatically. You'd still have the flexibility to go in and adjust as desired, but as a way to instantly try ideas (or, respond to notes), there is a lot of potential there.",

Considering I always start with lyrics, the goal is to use whatever style serves the song itself.  Last year, I was much more concerned with trying to fit my lyrics into a specific genre. The process was much more limiting, and I found that my music got better oncr I dropped that mindset.\n\nAll that said, my audience isn't developed yet. So it's a drastically different scenario. Nonetheless, this message shows me that you're doing a great job with him. It's hard to craft an authentic sound, so kudos for helping him with that goal!",

In standalone melodyne on a lot of pop tracks if it\u2019s a centered double I\u2019ll make it spot dead on, almost to the point where it\u2019s phasing, to beef up a lead to cut through a mix.

It\u2019s even less likely that it provides liability coverage for injuries or damage you may cause to other people or their property. \"\n\nYou still get the convenience of dealing with an individual/smaller company and the pickup/dropoff and knowing what vehicle you are getting, but price wise if you are risk-averse like me adding even the basic coverage bumps a Turo rental up into Hertz/Enterprise territory for my trip.\n\nEdit: also followed up with my auto insurance (I use Progressive) and they confirmed my coverages wouldn't extend to Turo rentals because it's technically classified as \"peer to peer\"",

You'd think \"well of course all the sample libraries I bought can do that just as well\"  but not imxp....  its that the sample libraries can do \"an adequate\" job and satisfythe need.  But once you hire world-class players and play it live into mics....  for me it was instantly \"we could've bought every sample library and programmed for days but never gotten this quality\" in the tiny details.  The bow sounds. The players breathing together. Their adaptation to dynamics. The aleatoric sections where advanced techniques were improvised. Samples can be amazing and do things humans can't...  but the inverse is also true.  There are many context where it's got to be live players, or else your track is just \"adequate\"",

Also, most of the songs I mix tend to be one\u2019s I\u2019ve written and produced as well, so hoping to cut down on session set-up time.\n\nSome of mine are an instant \u201cduck bus\u201d, which I picked up from Ian Kirkpatrick. It\u2019s a pre-loaded aux with something like LFO Tool or shaper box on it, so you can quickly route and uniformly make things side chain.\n\nAnother quick workflow thing I love is having Pro Tools audio playlists with a bunch of reverse sweeps, impacts and other transition fx/ear candy hidden and ready to go in the session, so you can quickly try out a bunch. \n\nI also have the trim plugin added as the first and last plugin on every new track preset, as I use them to quickly manage the gain in and out of each track and so I don\u2019t have to search for them constantly.\n\nOzone Spectral shaper on some music busses and as a replacement for Soothe on the mix bus has also been a real win (thanks Jon!) Although these sorta things aren\u2019t turned on whilst writing as they have a ton of latency.\n\nKeen to hear what you all find useful!",

Has there been an in-depth discussion on live or in discord yet about musicians on tiktok? \n\nIt's a crazy scene of selling your creative soul for 1 minute of attempting to go viral. and then if you do get a popular video, whatever that one was - that is now your thing... singing into a trash can doing RHCP covers... ok, now do another 100 of those.  I see so much talent on there, genuine talent and artists who have worked hard on their craft getting 10 views due to the algo... once the algo has tried your vid on a few people and it didn't stick the vid is dead... so it's totally hit and miss based on your first small sample of viewers.\n\nI see this having a huge impact in many ways. On the plus - you are getting exposure to incredible new ideas, skills, trends, methods for being creative... on the negative it's demotivating to the nth degree, and cheapening the creative process, in my opinion.\n\nMatt and Jon recently talked about track lengths getting shorter and shorter, now 2 minutes is the normal. Partly due to the attention span of people... well what is this going to do... 1 minute pop tracks incoming? Just gimme the hook in 30 seconds and let's move on please. :p. How can we get young people to lay on the floor and listen to 10 minute vinyl tracks again? In my opinion humanity NEEDS this :)) \n\nI also swear I've heard the influence of trending memes from tiktok coming through in music in the charts, but cannot really back this up.\n\nWhat's everyone else's thoughts? I have a friend in LA who says everyone has gone crazy there for tiktok fame? \ud83d\ude1b",

As long as the core material is compelling it's all fine to me. My one reservation might be if you need to have full cultural context to appreciate the \"meme-ness\" of the song. If the record doesn't hold up on it's own outside of that cultural context then it's probably weak songwriting. It's window of relevance is limited.",

We went back and forth eventually removing all the tuning and processing all together and they claimed something was wrong with their raw vocal tracks. They went back in the studio and re-recorded vocals and after another round of back and forth doing the same thing we're at square 1 again.",

It\u2019s made me even consider not using certain plugins in my productions if it\u2019s likely they won\u2019t be supported in the future (*cough* izotope).\n\nI\u2019m sure the solution is as simple as \u2018print a multitrack when done\u2019 but if anyone has any other thoughts I\u2019m all ears!",

Ran on a ton of mixing sessions and helped his guy out tho in that time...  the main assisting gig was a band called thousand foot krutch. I think maybe also a day or two on five finger death punch? I dont have it written down tho so not sure. Just digging back into my iCal now... the last long session i ran on before that was nickleback dark horse.. was like a month+ i think? I remember one day getting a fax from Mutt and it was just the song lyrics and little up and down arrows to show what vocal rides he wanted on like a bunch of words/parts of words and phrases lol. Brutal. No recall sheets, not mine to share!",

    "content": "Insight gives you A LOT of visual information that isn't really useful unless you know what you're looking for. I have two visual meters while I mix... a janky old Goldline RTA analyzer and a TC Electronics Clarity. The RTA is useful for quick visual cues of kick to snare balance, how subby something really is, or when I'm working out phase relationships between drum mics... I can quickly glance to help aid with decision making. It's not necessary for me to mix, but I've had it for 15 years and it helps me make certain technical decisions quicker. The Clarity is very useful for the loudness radar. I basically set a guide LUFS (in my case, I'm usually shooting for -9) and you get a great visual representation of where you're at over the course of the song. Its especially useful to avoid fader creep... where I might nail the dynamics and loudness in the earlier parts of the song, but might overlook the last chorus being significantly louder, and in some cases, more squashed than it needs to be. I'm also an LCR panning guy, and it has a 'balance-o-meter' feature that has a cool weighted algorithm for determining if your mix is leaning left or right.",

Where is money to be made and who's making it? \n\nPicking a nice round number, if you're an engineer on an album that gets a million streams a year, that's something like $4000 for the artist. Hopefully they generate money from touring, but based on the album's services alone, how much could an artist reasonably pay if their ROI is $4k?\n\nIf the gamble is to get hooked up with a new artist who has the potential to break through, the producer's points on a hit is where real money could be made, right? So pricing yourself to get at many chances at the lottery would likely be more fruitful than a few extra hundred per gig, but it's a gamble. Between repeat clients and chance for a moderate hit, it seems like a better way to spend your time\n\nAll that said, as you pointed out, this ain't my lane.",

I think of it as elements that would make you fall in love with the song even more as you listen to them over and over again- it overlaps with tastiness of the music too, but tastiness you notice right on the get go, while substance ferments over time and grows in my experience. That is not to say you can get hooked by the substance- but I\u2019d definitely say without tastiness, it\u2019s hard to make it to that point.",

Mostly pop music. A lot of my work is with producers or self produced artists and overseeing the final engineering of a project (mixing the track and then passing off to an ME)\nI\u2019m also one of the young ones so a lot of my connections that I make and work are through social media whether it be artists or producers. I don\u2019t want to open a can of worms but I\u2019m just finding so many people that are wearing the generalist hat (specifically from a producer standpoint). Seeing a lot of credits that involve one person Co-writing, producing, mixing and mastering a record or seeing a lot of productions where the mixer is completely bypassed because the prod & mix is done by the same person. Would just love to hear peoples opinions on the topic",

A close friend of mine is a modern Jazz Saxophonist, he said he once broke up with his band after an argument because he didn\u2019t want to play the melody but his band members were more traditional and wanted him to play the head. \n\nImo calling something not Jazz because they aren\u2019t doing the head-solo-head form is like calling modern classical music not classical music because of the aleatoric composition. Somewhat of a valid opinion, but not really. \n\nWould you call wayne shorter not a jazz musician because he writes scores for his band? (well\u2026 he\u2019s also a free jazz musician\u2026) \n\nFor general public, traditional jazz and traditional classical music would be more appealing to listen to for most people due to the predictability factor. Modern classical music and modern jazz is a movement to explore creative possibilities beyond that, but\u2026 it\u2019s often not done so tastefully because they step too far off the predictability.\n\nBut Jazz is a free form of expression. I think a lot of non-jazz musicians hate on Jazz because it\u2019s somewhat cerebral (it really isn\u2019t once you get past it\u2026 which I couldn\u2019t just yet), and a lot of people choose music because of its unexplainable magic people experience from it. It\u2019s only natural that the same people that was attracted to the unexplainable nature of music being turned off by the explainable nature of harmonies and rhythms. Jazz noobs and Berklee kids may make it look like that what Jazz is about and some have elitism behind it too, but that\u2019s not jazz. All the theory and stuff is a door you go through to be able to step into the world of self expression with an open form. (to be fair many old school jazz musicians solely played by ear with no knowledge in music theory. because\u2026 it all comes from their ears at the end of the day)\n\nWhether one wants to sit through someone expressing themselves is theirs to decide.",

Killer drums tones, deep verbs, tripped out delay throws, beautiful vocal textures \u2026 all the stuff we love\n- Your journey continues and hopefully over time you have access to better songs, players, gear, rooms etc and the quality of your sonic output continues to improve\n\nYou may eventually arrive at \u201cPeak Wow\u201d\n\nThis is the moment where your ability and gear allows you to actually create and wield the sounds that set you on this crazy journey. Your mixes are wide, and deep and loud and impressive and hit and knock and do all of the things \u2026. \u201cWOW, that sounds amazing\u201d \u2026.\n\nBut notice we haven\u2019t mentioned feel in a minute. Here\u2019s what I think happens to a lot of Engineers, some graduate out of it and some don\u2019t\n\nLiken our journey described above to using your hands to make shadow animals on a wall. You probably don\u2019t remember the first time you saw that as a kid but it\u2019s wild! Pretty soon you\u2019ve got a pair of bunny ears going, and maybe a swan or a spider",

I see a lot of people successfully doing media planning (release scheduling etc) with ChatGPT now - that seems to be one of the areas where AI can do a pretty stellar job, but you'd still need someone to look over/execute.\n\nOverall it sounds like you might need someone with a pretty broad skillset. I'd look at an ex youtuber/part time youtuber in your position probably, but few of them have the technical chops to make lyric videos or film acoustic videos to a high standard - I'd suggest those are two different roles, unless you get very lucky. The cinematography and lyric video making (motion graphics) are also considered more high paying skillsets, so even if you do find someone with the entire range of skills, you might end up paying more than splitting them up.\n\nOverall your plan sounds good! Sounds great that you're willing to be hands off, that will pay immensely in my experience. \n\nRe: meetings, I don't really have an approach apart from avoiding them as much as possible. Try to schedule group calls when it's possible to multitask. What kind of meetings do you have with your team now?",

    "content": "Hey everyone. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about \u201cpoint of view\u201d when it comes to artists, and I\u2019d love to hear the community\u2019s thoughts. \n\nMost successful artists (by numbers, following, cultural impact, etc) tend to have a certain point of view. It\u2019s often somewhat broad and difficult to pinpoint  exactly what it is. Charli XCX has a song about doing cocaine at a club and a song wondering if she will run out of time to have a baby on the same album, but neither feels out of place. The Sabrina record has multiple distinct sonic landscapes within it but they feel coherent when played next to each other. \u201cSlim Pickins\u201d and \u201cBed Chem\u201d come to mind as pretty different from each other. Post Malone and Beyonc\u00e9 both went country and it seemed perfectly natural. All of these projects feel like they have a distinct point of view despite an evolving multitude of lyrical content and sonics. \n\nWhen I hear less successful artists, I often perceive a lack of a point of view. Their perspective may feel generic, it might jump around in a way that isn\u2019t coherent, or it might not be the best representation of who they are. Sometimes the music might be coming from a genuine place and is GREAT, but it doesn\u2019t quite land because the artist hasn\u2019t been able to pinpoint exactly who they are sonically/lyrically/artistically and also how exactly to bring that into the world. Sometimes their preconceptions of who they are or preoccupation with a shiny new idea can get in the way too.",

I think he understood the point of view of RHCP better than they themselves did. He found a little piece of magic and somehow got the band to let go of their prior conceptions of their identify and record the song. Some Jedi shit for real. \n\nHow do I do that? Should I do that? How should we as producers think about point of view when creating for/with artists? To what extent should we be involved in crafting the point of view? What should we do when an artist has potential but is lacking a distinct point of view? What is even is point of view?\n\nAny thoughts would be welcome.",

Vocals and guitar recorded over a 2track beat. I typically throw a Waves L2 on my master, just to bring up the level for the rough bounce, never doing much more than a dB or two of gain reduction. In this case I had the threshold of the L2 set at -3.4. The producer said try -3.5, then back to -3.4, then -3.5\u2026 flipping back and forth seeing what he liked more. I couldn\u2019t hear a difference. (I should say that we weren\u2019t in a well treated room, working on some mid sized genelecs. It\u2019s a  setup neither of us is super familiar with.) He decided -3.4 was better and I was in disbelief that he could even hear a difference. I asked if I could do a blind test to see if he could tell which setting was which. He closed his eyes and I switched back and forth a bunch of times before landing on a setting, and he called it correct three times in a row. He said he could hear something in the kick drum but couldn\u2019t explain more than that.\nI need a sanity check. I know my ears aren\u2019t hall of fame, but I\u2019m still in disbelief that he was able to tell a .1dB difference in volume on the limiter.",

But when you think about human nature though. The one place that we nearly collectively agree across all cultures, continents, religions, and so on. That pedophilia is immoral and an act of depravity that has next to no equal on earth. Think of the furvor around Jerry Epstien, and other notable cases. Lots of people feel this passionately. And find a chorus of agreement of the stance. So a song that plays on that particular emotive center. And finding traction with a large group of people makes sense to me in that regard",

    "content": "Me personally, Yeezus was the last album that I was super moved by and I've never really had much of a desire to revisit any of his stuff, as brilliant as it is (though I might try after this convo). But on this topic, I find it hard/impossible to completely 100% enjoy a piece of work after the artist has done something disagreeable, taken a public downfall or occasionally if I had a negative personal experience with them. Even though I might intellectually appreciate the beauty of the work, my heart just feels a slight bit of ick -- akin to that feeling of trying to enjoy a meal that you know is super delish but you burned your tongue on a hot cup of coffee the day before. So I\u2019ll just end up choosing to listen to something else instead. This also makes me intensely appreciate my past experiences with the art. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever enjoy it the same way again but I\u2019m so glad I was able to completely enjoy Puff Daddy productions, R. Kelly songs, Woody Allen\u2019s movies, Bill Cosby\u2019s comedy, and Kanye West\u2019s early albums when they were coming out and having their day.

It\u2019s tough to breakthrough in here (anywhere tbh) in English without the help of a label (which I do not want), so imo joining forces and fan bases on an EP could work nicely since playlisting can help. A friend of mine, not a very good EDM producer manages to get to great numbers with submithub and hypeeddit, which only make sense in widely spread languages and Czech isn\u2019t one of them",
