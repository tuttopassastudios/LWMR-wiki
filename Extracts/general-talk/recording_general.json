During my paternity leave, my creative outlets were cooking, and photography. \n\nPhotos are great cause you can snag a moment and then come back to it later to edit, cooking more difficult cause it takes time you might not always have. \n\nWell in typical captial C Creative fashion, i dug deep into it. I did a LOT of research and made some purchases and practiced a lot. Got some beautiful photos and captured some important memories. Really grateful for it. \n\nAll that\u2019s just backstory to say- everywhere else on the internet SUCKS. \n\nReddit, Facebook, anywhere there are communities of people who are \u201ctrying to help,\u201d it\u2019s just full of tone deaf assholes with little info and a lot of bullshit to spew.

Love being a quaity of a attention, a way of meeting things. It might not be obvious but it can start small and grow out embracing many more aspects of what we do\n\nI mastered an album a few months back for a phenomenal indie artist, @Rob Domos and I both absolutely loved the music and the overall experience. The artist's team came back this week with a last minute request to remaster what was probably my favorite track with an added feature from a legacy artist. It's kind of mind bending how much better it is\n\nRob and I spent some time yesterday just appreciating that someone (the artist, manager, A&R?) actually thought up the idea of this feature and made it happen. I was so content with what it was but someone somewhere was like *\"you know what would be sick ...\"* and made it real. And now the world gets to receive something beyond what we could have imagined, something we didn't even know we needed\n\nJust focussing our attention on that for 2 mins in the hall yesterday made the day better and put some gas in the tank. There are so many challenges in what we do, it really helps to take time to focus attention on the jewels strewn everywhere too. They are not always immediately obvious",

    "content": "God I love this discord. \nTo me 90% of the reason big producers are paying many thousands a day to be in a studio the past 15-20 years is to just not have to worry about shit. Anyone can make a record at home these days; part of being in an \u201cactual\u201d studio is the cocoon of creativity. If the assistant takes more than a couple of minutes to patch anything in, bring up the piano, or recommend the best Thai place in town, they\u2019re blowing it. I had an assistant once at this place famous for making cookies on site, bring me my normal plate of cookies I always ask for and while I was comping I ate half of one, put it back on the plate, and continued working. He didn\u2019t say a word, got up, grabbed the plate, and disappeared for a few minutes and came back. \u201cHey man, I know you normally house the entire plate of cookies so when you put that one back I checked with the kitchen and last week I guess they changed the cookie recipe, and they\u2019re gonna make em like they used to for you.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I asked for that dude every session after, less for the cookies but more for the insane attention to detail and telepathy. One of max\u2019s engineers started as a Conway assistant, and as good of an engineer as he was he also prepped the best Hookahs and was just a great hang. Max ended up hiring him for his own studio. We\u2019re in a people business, try to be attentive and a good person to have around, for all the reasons that go beyond knowing how to set an attack on an 1176. \n\nThe flip side is, if you\u2019re booking a studio as a producer, the assistants are what really make the studio run. Treat them well. Know their names. Give them credit. No assistant on any session I ever did paid for their own meal, they got what the artist got.  They most of the time got engineer credits. Help them along. As with all things, mutual respect goes a long way.",

    "content": "\u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d - Ira Glass",

    "content": "Re; Brauer workshop\n\n-First 2 days were nothing technical, the 1st conversation he brought up was about TM and how meditation in general has helped him.\n-Everything is feel-based, most technical Q's for the first 2 and a half days got the same reply: \"It doesn't matter to me, i don't care what the thing is long as it feels good\". \n-MHB actually seems to leave the planet while he's mixing, it's wild how immediate he gets into that space. Seemed to go way past \"i love mixing and here's all the reasons i'm the shit\" and it was inspiring to see the ego leave the equation. His decades of experience are playing directly into his ability to access the story of the song and present it in a compelling, live-feeling way. He mixes from inside the song and performs. Well, he does discovery, then shapes the sounds, then performs just about everything on faders.\n-The biggest wake up call to me is that a lot of moves i've made on mixes did not have a good reason behind them. So continuing to ask \"why\" as I work is gonna be important, because I have to start catching myself and adjusting when the answer to \"why\" is \"because someone said this preset is cool\" or \"because this is what I do to a vocal/guitar/drums\". I feel music very deeply, it's why i got into this, but I feel like i've been poisoned against trusting that instinct and convinced that what we do is a technical job. I'm done being an observer of the art, i want to be bold.\n-It's critical to build trust with clients right away, you can't assume anything in what they understand about how you feel. Telling them you love the song and you're excited to mix it is important, and never blaming production/artist/anything else for the mix being less than what it should be. never okay to say \"i did my best\", because that gives you an out and implies somebody else could do it better\n-Therefore, you must believe when you sit down to mix that nobody is gonna interpret this song better than you.\n-Generally i'm skeptical to just take on someone else's \"method\" and start operating in that space just becuase of the success they've had with it. Putting this week into practice is going to mean using his template to get reps in, listening and feeling and interacting in a new way and letting my brain \"level up\", if you will, then zooming out and making it my own.\n\n\nI can distill this more and want to share about a couple other specifics, but I just realized I grabbed someone else's notebook by mistake when I left on the last day so I'll need to have them mail mine back to me.",

But I kept at it because I\u2019m tenacious, (read: delusional, as all artists must be.)\n\nI was able to work *for* some of those artists cause I had a diverse skillset, and I was full time music after about 4 years, by the time I was 26. Doing gigs at hotels and playing guitar or recording for other people, teaching guitar, leading music at churches, all the while pouring evening last ounce of money & energy into my artist career, until my last real artist project broke up the week we were supposed to sign our first record deal. I was 36. \n\nThat\u2019s when I moved to Nashville and really gave myself over to music directing and producing and writing for other artists. I did it as a consolation while I regrouped to find my next thing, but for some reason, when I made the move all the sudden my whole career made sense to me. \n\nAs it turns out, my real joy comes not from the sound of my own voice, but from helping others find theirs. When I acquiesced to that very real, very culturally counterintuitive calling, I thrived. \n\nAll the sudden I was playing music with and for a bunch of my heroes, and all my friends who were artists starting getting famous. And (shocker) I was really glad I wasn\u2019t one of them. \n\nI always thought that my calling was to help people feel less alone in the world, and that the music I made was the vehicle for that calling. In the end, it turns out it was the relationships i built through music that were the real vehicle.  \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out who I was, and the cities I was in played a huge role in that story. Nashville built its whole industry on people who want to *help* artists, not just *be* artists. \n\nI miss LA every day but I\u2019m in the right place. So, my friend, where is the right place for you?",

Have you worked with anyone I\u2019d know?\u201d\n\nFor the longest time the answer to that question was NO. And so the question felt like \u201cAre you somebody?\u201d\n\nBut now I can answer Taylor Swift. *Everyone* knows Taylor\u2026\n\nBut you know what\u2019s happened? I realized that what they were asking all along is \u201cAm I somebody?\u201d\n\nThey are working changing my oil or whatever and looking for a little berry on the tree, or a shell on the beach. Something to take home that day, something to lift them up a little. \u201cI met a guy who does XYZ today\u201d. I do it all the time. My neighbor drives the Mars Rover. I mean, she goes to work, logs in and drives the fucking Mars Rover. And that is amazing. And being proximate to it makes me just a little more special in that silly human way\n\nSo, a little empathy for the shell gathering normies",

Having only experienced studio work as a cottage industry up to that point, PP opened my eyes to avenues I could pursue that I wouldn\u2019t have known even existed otherwise (recording engineer is different to mixing engineer is different to producer is different to songwriter??!). It all seems very rudimentary now, but I was starting from literally nothing in a place with few (if any?) visible role models.\n\nI learned so much from it on a technical level - from basic stuff like what a Pultec is and how people use it (connecting the dots between my cracked Waves bundle - Puigtec and who tf JJP was), what \u201ca vocal chain\u201d might look like and the purpose of each stage\u2026\n\nTrue, the interviews did become unbearable, but there was a golden era between eps around 30-90 at a time when outside of working in the studio world, there weren\u2019t many other sources of good information from people who were really doing it.\n\nHuge appreciation for Dave, and I hope he and his family get the support they need.",

On mixing the Rage Renegades album with Rick Rubin: \n\n\"Rick called me up after I worked on Fiona Apple \"When The Pawn..\". I learned a lot from him, primarily how to work from instinct instead of intellect. He would often make mix suggestions which I thought were bad ideas but I would of course do them because it's what he wanted, and they worked. He really did listen like a teenager, it was always simply whether or not he was getting off on something. If he wasn't, he'd make very clear suggestions on how to make something better. Sometimes he'd just say the mix sucked and to start over (only once). Sometimes the recording itself had issues and he would just deal with what's there. I think that turned into a serious strength of his- working with what's in front of him. We still keep in touch from time to time\"",

I think we've all casually opened the app at one point and seen \"40+ unread messages\" and been taken aback by the sheer amount of convo that we now have to catch up on.\n\nMoving forward I ask the following from everyone:\n\n*1. If you see a conversation starting to ramp up use Discord\u2019s **Create Thread** feature to fork off the conversation into a self-contained thread. (see attached pic)\n2. Give the thread a descriptive name.\n3. Continue all follow-up posts within the new thread.*",

I look back upon that now and I\u2019m still amazed that I was paid to do that. It was essentially like a paid college degree in making records.\n\nSo now when I go into studios with a big client, I see the assistant through those eyes. I\u2019m kind but communicative. If they can hang in the back and figure out how I work, anticipate breaks \u2014 get the menu book ready \u2014 know that we\u2019re going to change gears \u2014 start setting up for that \u2014 then they get looped in. They get my running commentary on what techniques I\u2019m doing. They get the inside baseball\u2026 \u201cI wish they fired this fucking drummer\u201d. \n\nI agree with Ruairi that this type of coming up through the ranks is a loss for up and comers. It was tried and true way to make people understand the ins and outs of studio technique, etiquette, professionalism. I\u2019m glad I got to ride one of the last waves of it.

When she gets to one of mine (a picture I hadn\u2019t turned in but she somehow had found), all of the colors were bizarre and unrealistic. I\u2019d performed an experiment where I tried to achieve neutral whites by picking only yellow subjects and shooting them with a maximally cold white balance straight to film.

We render and send 500-1000 files a month with the revisions on the 200-300 monthly songs that I do.  Team players don't ask such things on CC.  I work usually 7 days a week for 40-50 people a month, and making them happy with great masters is job #1.  Perfectionism is not a part of that process.    Software makes mistake, and that's ok.    People make mistakes and that's ok.   Mixes and masters should never aim for perfect, they should aim to connect, aim for humanity.  \n\nPerfection is not the goal here, it's musicality and teamwork.  I'm sorry your ears suffered that horrible popping, but please, be cool. \"",

The youth can learn from the older generations  in particular in certain genres of music there are certain  things that are only documented in recordings or past on from the previous generation.

Success in our (and frankly most fields) isn\u2019t given, it\u2019s taken. There were so many people, some incredibly close to me, that insisted I was going fail.

Classical music is an organizational nightmare right now on streaming services because classical music gets filed/classified way differently than pop music that has a single, definitive recording.\n\nIf I'm hunting for a recording of 'The Rite of Spring' there could be 40 different versions available to pick from. We need finer criteria to specify which version we're seeking. I need tools to search by the following: Piece name, movement, conductor, orchestra, year of recording, remastered/original, etc. The list goes on. Classical listeners need that level of granularity because the different recordings/interpretations are a big deal in the classical world.",

The stakes for errors have gone up - when they are manufacturing 100k copies of vinyl then you have to be sure it\u2019s error free\n\n**Do you reject artists if they approach you to \u201cMaster my album i\u2019ll pay you whatever you want\u201d if you think the level of their sound might not honour your history with all these artists**\n\nI don\u2019t reject *anyone* who can pay my rate. I don\u2019t vet clients on a \u201chow will you make me look?\u201d basis, I\u2019m a service provider to them. There are very very occasionally mismatches where I\u2019ll say \u201chappy to do this but I think you\u2019d be better served by XYZ\u201d, an example being someone coming to me with EDM who wants really intense processing - another girl or guy steeped in that genre will serve them better\n\n**How does it feel having a connection to these artists?**\n\nIt feels really nice to be trusted with people\u2019s art, when someone like a St. Vincent says \u201cyeah, this is good\u201d it matters to me, she has great ears and taste so it feels good to hit a mark\n\nIt\u2019s also very special to hear these things come out of the speaker for the first time - I\u2019ll never forget hearing Nick Cave, or Taylor or Lana in the room for the first time. It\u2019s a privilege to be trusted with their art\n\n**but does it ever happen that you are wanting more?\u201d**\n\nI\u2019m human and can be reliably trusted to do all the silly human things like being greedy, insecure, fearful etc. but every year I get a little better at living a better way, and around the music in particular my operating principles \u201cThe why\u201d feel better and truer than they ever have",

    "content": "Coincidentally I was exploring a similar idea this morning. I'm on a David Bohm kick and was reading his book 'On Dialogue' and recently finished his 'On Creativity' (would highly recommend both).\n\nIn 'On Dialogue' he gives an example I think can be repurposed here. Imagine a song being presented to us. An external signal. When it reaches us it makes contact with what Bohm calls the \"whole movement of thought\". The thinking and feeling apparatus within us is activated. Thoughts and 'felts' are said to be fundamentally created from memory. Upon contact a 're-presentation' is created where the activity of our thought and feeling reforms the event internally. The 'net presentation' is the fused result. 'Mis-representation' occurs when we mistake the 'net presentation' for the original.\n\nI was thinking on all this and how it might connect to your comment from yesterday, \"I told Jon that I don't think he's ever brought more to an album, but also left less of his fingerprints on it\".\n\nBohm brings up Michael Polanyi's idea of tacit knowledge. This is the always running in the background implicit structure we attend to music from, which makes 're-presentation' possible. This includes nostalgia for records we love, perceptual training, bodily memory, tolerance for brightness, etc... Implied here is that this is something you cannot turn off but can cultivate greater awareness off in disciplined participation with art. Polanyi says we attend from subsidiaries to a focal whole. If you start attending to your own sonic fingerprint as the focal object, the structure may collapse. So perhaps Jon was able to integrate a remarkable tacit contribution while being sensitive to the pre-existing structure and coherence of the whole. Maybe coherence and truth have similar meanings here?\n\nDownstream of the artist's origination maybe 'truth' in record making is deep tacit integration, suspending egoic domination, and sensitivity to the internal structure / coherence of the original whole.",

When Hans Zimmer recorded an orchestra and started writing music with a DAW and showing clients mockups, nothing was ever the same. For a long time (even now!) the pencil-and-paper people griped about how it wasn't real composition. Orchestras feared that they would all be replaced by computers. But ultimately, everyone had to come to terms with the new world order and adapt. There was a period in the mid-90s through mid-late 2000s where orchestral writing was reduced to nothing more than long notes and short notes. All of the nuance was gone, because the tech couldn't handle it yet and people blamed the tech. Many mourned the loss of true orchestral writing, yearning for a by-gone era. \n\nBut eventually, people learned to harness these new tools and they met the technology on its own terms. People are doing wildly innovative things with samples now, we've moved completely past the era of \"can I make a convincing clarinet come out of my keyboard?\" Orchestras and live musicians have not been replaced. Sure, the process is different than it used to be, but that's how innovations work. All of us would be living very different lives without samples of drums, guitars, orchestras, synths, etc. There will be a generation coming up where AI is already a thing, they won't have ever lived in the before-times. Just like those here who've never cut to tape. It's okay.",

    "content": "I wanted to make a similar heartfelt post. I've been super under the pump the past few months with corporate AV work and had a last minute session yesterday that went really well and everyone's super happy with! \n\nThis was only the second session I've done in this studio, the first was a semi nightmare which lay beyond my control (I had two hours to setup from scratch and record 4 tracks with a trio in a brand new room.. and I'm no Noah Needleman) although everyone's happy with it, it was somewhat disheartening to have my first session back in the studio be completely rushed and slapped together \n\nThis time I really wanted to prepare and took to digging in the server for a game plan. Shout outs to @chrissorem and @Eric Martin, I picked up 2 x m88s for vocal and double bass.... I'm super impressed and stoked with how these sound and I wouldn't have found them without your suggestions. (I also got a great deal on a M130, I haven't heard many people talk about them but it ruled on overhead)\n\nBut mainly, as someone who's not recording everyday, after a pretty average session a few weeks back, just reading this servers helped really refresh my perspective on why I'm doing what I'm doing and to go into the next session better prepared and focused. Very nice to have great feeling tracks right after and pretty average session in a new space\n\nBig thanks to everyone!!",

Everybody tells me the producer/band leader is this prolific asshole, constantly blowing up at people and impossible to please. The previous mixer had been mixing this thing for months/over a year and everyone was worn out/not getting results. I was really reluctant to take on the project for fear of being intimidated/failing to deliver.\n\nI've made a point of greeting the producer at every step with clear communication, enthusiasm, and an open mind. I genuinely love the music and have made a point of letting him know how much fun it's been to work on the stuff. And, similar to your story, we were basically approved on the first track within 4 mixes and the guy seemed really really happy.\n\nEveryone just said this guy was a hopeless asshole, but what I saw was a guy who was working so hard to bring a vision to life and just struggling to get there; self-financing, overseeing everything, etc... and it's fairly complex, hip hop and soul vibes with practically a full orchestra and 3 vocalists, so it's a lot to manage. Not trying to excuse the asshole behavior, but I see the frustration and I really wanted to highlight how much cool work he had done and that, without any fuss or needless back and forth, we would just get it where it needed to go. i tried to just think about how exciting it could be to finally hear these songs that've been bouncing around in his head actually come out of the speaker the way he imagined. We've got 7 songs almost done now and I've grown so much just from these attitude alignments i've picked up from spending time here.",

I could attend in 2017, and the Mix With The Masters' talks were incredible at that conference (it was remarkable to see Al Schmitt in person before he passed). \n\nThis year, MWTM live-streamed all of the talks, but they were all during work hours.

I get overwhelmed very easily, so I find that this is often needed. BUT, if you\u2019re gonna go armadillo, then you wanna really commit to it until you feel a bit calmer and collected. Which leads to the next point \n\n2) sometimes I lie to myself that I\u2019m taking a break but do a few spurts of work because I feel useless not doing work. I\u2019ve learned that this needs to be avoided or else the \u201cbreak\u201d will be extended into a longer period of time, and I\u2019d be doing little work here and there but also not get anything done properly. It takes a bit of commitment to take a proper break, and in order  to be able to commit to it - recognizing it as a part of maintenance routine to stay well functioning is really important in my experience. I am pretty bad at pacing myself and managing my own mental and physical wellness, so I am working towards being able to put the brake on early enough so that I don\u2019t crash or skid away into a crash \ud83d\ude02\n\n3) to deal with that feeling of feeling useless, I found that doing things that I wanted to do can help once I have gotten calmer by being in armadillo state for a bit. Getting straight back to work from here for me is extremely difficult, so I start with the combination of taking care of chores that got backed up from busy life and doing what I desire outside of work life. Could be trying a new restaurant, picking up a new hobby or getting back to the hobby that gone on hold due to work life",

    "content": "i think the premise of this stems from the constant fight that i feel like we all face....wanting something to be the \"best\" it can be (at least in our personal minds and perspectives) vs the sometimes reality that we are hired to do a \"job\" and not everything is going to meet our expectations of what we personally think is great, because at the end of the day, we aren't the artist...or in some cases, even the intended audience. with that said...if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. / might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it...so who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. this is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world...but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

It takes longer to open gmail than it does to zap the click. \n\nAnd think of the logical conclusion of asking the mixing engineer to fix the edit. They don\u2019t have the edit, they have the comp. So then if you extend the logic they have to hit up the producer, and MAYBE the producer has to hit up the recording engineer if you really wanna \u201cget to the source\u201d. It\u2019s like the meme of the producer who didn\u2019t want to use splice because it was cheating and ended up farming sheep to get skin to make his own drumheads. Just do the fucking work.

Sam Fender put it really well this week with regards to the music industry so I won\u2019t go over stony ground, you can google his thoughts which I largely relate to.\n\nAs an individual I\u2019m horribly determined and annoyingly persistent when I have a goal in mind, as well as always balancing that with being the kindest person I can be towards others (sometimes to my detriment) and pretty much always in a headspace of bettering myself personally and professionally. This has generally been the key to many of the opportunities I\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s an English word for it, \u201cnous\u201d, which I think is similar to agency but also encompasses the notion of having \u201cgood sense\u201d.

On the other hand, I get hired by a band, they are super intense and ambitious about recording, mixing, and releasing - the album comes out and they breakup in 3 months or theres a lineup change where the new drummer has a home studio and can record everything there and mix it then 6 months later I get a IG dm to bail them out becuase the drummer fucked the guitarists wife and the bass player and vocalist are just going to finish the record on their own with me.",

Nothing in the back of my mind lingering, letting myself down.. \n\nAdditionally I have let my self imposed work hours go, just freeing myself to be open to the art life as it comes, any hours of the day. Trying to bottle everything into a 9-5 was difficult for me.. why are artists calling me at 9pm? Well.. that's when they are off from their day job and can talk. I took that boundary away for myself and felt some self imposed frustration melt away. Grateful for the calls, emails, texts, DMs.. any hours. Bring it on. \n\nBoth of these changes have helped my attitude and optimism AND HOPE of a future in music and art.. Continuing this on into 2026.",

In my teaching I get them active early in the process.  Get them excited by the process, find out if there are any players in the group.  Get thme to jam, let the others engineer.  Rotate roles frequently.  Teach them fundamentals while they work.  Some people spend 3 hours teaching them how to coil a cable, and while this is important I always work it into a real environment.  Always, always ask what their favourite songs are and relate the teaching to that.  Got a room full of EDM kids? Get them to engineer a band tracking, then get them to deconstruct and remixit the next week using a DAW.  In doing this they'll learn far more and you can tailor specific elements as you go.",

Probably won't fully be recovered for another 18-24 months.\n2. Depends on the need. For a business, leasing probably makes more sense than owning. The lease can be taken as a deduction.\n3. If you are buying new, you will eat the depreciation cost. If you are buying used, the depreciation is already priced in. If you want a relatively new car, I will always recommend going Certified Pre-Owned. One of the better deals in automotive with the benefit of a likely extended warranty coverage. There are plenty of high quality used vehicles out there that are effectively new (full disclosure, I work for Carvana...the vehicles are reconditioned similar to CPO standard). My last I don't know how many cars have all been gently used late-model used cars. Cars these days are more durable and reliable than they've ever been. Low risk in buying late-model used. I will only ever buy used anymore.\n4. Whoever offers you the lowest APR. That is often the captive lender, but rates are a bit of a cluster fuck these days so shop around for the lowest. One fun fact: if you are buying from a dealer, APR's are negotiable. They will tell you that's the best they can do, but they take margin on the loan. There's meat on the bone there if you want to do battle. \n5. Car prices can fluctuate seasonally yes, but wouldn't try and time the market. You won't save that much.",

It\u2019s about Regaining the Connection to your Senses. \n\nFor a long time now I was living in a kinda \u201cnumb\u201d state where everything I listened to, looked at, tasted, touched and smelled was \u201coverruled\u201d by my rationality (what I would describe as a sixth sense). So I was constantly living in this thing where my rationality dictated my connection to my surroundings, which lead me to be in a very anxious, depressed kind of state obviously reflecting back at my work. \n\nNow with that realisation I started practicing focusing on just on sense at a time, like putting my visual sense in the foreground or just deeply listening and so on. It immediately set back the rationality sense in a way, where it would leave the space to really experience the emotion of the stimulus. \n\nIt really feels great and I want to take a moment to really thank everyone on here for leading the conversation to a better place.

That alien sound came about because extremely loose muscles create far less sympathetic intermodulation which sounds cleaner. It\u2019s the same as how a speaker makes your desk vibrate and create out of time interference pattern distortions. Muscle tension creates hard surfaces that do the same when singing and opera singers obsess over undoing this. This is a big reason why so many of your favorite vocalists are opioid and benzo addicts. It\u2019s not just culture. Downers are performance enhancing here. (Please don\u2019t get any ideas artists) \n\nThe modern pop voice is just maintaining that exaggerated opera looseness but with adaptations for the modern medium: English diphthongs instead of Latin ones, way less air in their lungs because the target is a foot from their mouth instead of 50 feet, and softened fricatives because a capsule right in front of the mouth harshly exaggerates fricatives. \n\nFrom a physics perspective it\u2019s the perfectly optimized way to sing in 2024. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance sounds like",

Once we got to the beach, most days I was leaving my phone and watch in the room while we explored the immediate area. Found myself going \"what time is it?\" and then had to tell myself \"eh...it doesn't really matter\" and that was a great feeling that took some getting used to. I definitely feel different coming back from the trip, and it's more important to me now that i'm back in my work environment that I make a more conscious effort to create space for me to be the person i want to be, and not the person that everyone wants me to be \"on demand\" and a deadline.",

I\u2019ve also had a lot of people make comments about how much they like my rooms vs other studios they\u2019ve worked in. \n\nSo while I\u2019m in school I wanna offer my rooms to other people who are serious about their music so they can take their stuff to a level they\u2019re happy with and is pro sounding enough. It really bums me out when I see people in the local scene who are super good, passionate, and hardworking when it comes to creating their music met with roadblocks caused by bad rooms, poor engineering, and economics. \n\nIf anyone wants to chime in with ideas, I\u2019m thinking of offering a free session to students at my university to come record with me/just letting friends I trust into my spaces to use while I\u2019m in class or whatever",

    "content": "I think a good way to summarize the benefit of Andrej's approach here is by looking at two different ways to go about learning how a frog works: \n\n1) You can dissect a frog to learn about it. You observe the long legs, the muscles, the skin, the eyes, the respiratory system, etc. You see it's strengths and you see it's weaknesses and you draw your conclusions from there. This would be the top-down learning approach. It's good at describing what already *is*. \n\nOr...\n\n2) You build/design a frog from scratch. You will quickly come to understand why things *have* to be the way they are. You realize that all of the evolutionary \"choices\" about a frog's physiology are simply the best possible compromises, given the pressures of the environment, the availability of resources, and the limits of physics. By building it yourself you will come to perceive all of the invisible challenges and \"solved\" problems that were required to make an organism that will simply survive, much less thrive.\n\nThis firsthand experience of building the thing will actually make you an expert because you've done the hard work and experienced it for yourself. You took ten paths to failure and made every mistake before settling on a a non-obvious compromise that allows you to balance it against every other factor. You understand *why* it needs to be that way.\n\nThis knowledge will make you robust and flexible, whereas top-down knowledge is more superficial and brittle. If the conditions of your subject change and the model you understand is no longer relevant then you're in a far more precarious place than someone who's built something from the ground up.",

In an ideal world, you'd map out an aesthetic for a record in pre-production and make choices in recording & production to try and stay within those lines, whatever that means. A real world example I have is when I was doing the last Mini Mansions album, we locked onto a few H3000 patches that sort of defined how the drums and ambience would sound throughout the record. We obviously didn't use it on everything, but it helped thread the needle through a wildly diverse batch of songs. After that, having one person mix the whole album will undoubtedly help tie together a record that's been all over the map in production -- be it different styles or producers. As someone that often is tasked with doing this, I am always referencing other songs in the album to try and make sure things are sounding 'consistent'. By the time mastering comes, everything should sound 99% complete.",

Maybe I need to live with them for longer and get used to it.\n\nLast week was the first time that I was able to sit in front of an Atmos setup that was meant for music (aka: not in a movie theater) and really get the full musical experience. In fact, I got to sit in front of *three* different Atmos rigs in three different (treated) rooms that evening and two of them were undoubtedly set up as good as they could have possibly been (One was a PMC showroom and the other built and tuned with their input). While the speakers themselves were impressive and very capable, the actual experience felt pretty disjointed. There was a pronounced feeling of phasi-ness that I didn't like.\n\nIt was great hearing these records on a rig that probably cost $250k, but my big takeaway was that they felt disjointed and odd. Even when sitting in the sweet spot.\n\nPerhaps my opinion will change with more exposure, but I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the time and effort. I will add, though, that half the mixes we heard were up-mixed from old stereo recordings with minimal track counts and only two of them were modern productions.",

After doing a first pass, I sent them the multitracks they asked for, to track the rest of their stuff with their producer (a colleague of mine). The next 8 months were spent waiting on their files to start mixing (this was supposed to last 1/2 months, max). When I finally got the files, you have no ideia how messy the project turned out (track names, bounce mistakes, ultrapocessed tracks with artifacts - even the ones we've tracked at the studio before, audible edit points,... all you can imagine going wrong at this point), so it took me a bunch of time to organize everything in a way that I could work with what I've got (going back and forth asking the producer for some files that didn't even get to me or asking if there was the possibility to get some of the tracks dry, without processing or fx - keep this in mind).\n\nNeedless to say, when I was ready to start mixing, I was already overwhelmed and tired of it, and I knew I still had a long way to go...\n\nFirst version took me probably too long to get right (2 months, approx., working on other projects that got scheduled on those 8 months) and I've sent it before I went on a few days vacation.",

Maybe it\u2019s harder to find people who are okay with the uncertainty of the life path you\u2019re choosing. I would just say don\u2019t buy into the pressure to have it all figured out right now and trust that there is a person out there for you who will understand what you do and love you for it. Unfortunately a lot of people do like to take advantage of us for various reasons, but I bet you can tell if someone is genuinely into you for you or if they\u2019re trying to use you.

They'll soon enough meet the wall of Reality into which every one of us is continually smashed. And their intrinsic level of motivation/confidence will handle it or it won't. \n\nYou tell a 12yo talented niece she can't be a professional singer, and she'll internally respond with either, \"Oh...that's sad...I would've loved to do that,\" or she'll respond with some variation of \"Efffffff that...I'm gonna' change the world,\" and then she might. 99% won't, but that attitude is table stakes for that 1% that we're all shooting for here. \n\nThe latter response will happen no matter *what* is told to a given person with a high level of self-motivation. Giving the truth of the difficulties seems to only help by giving the motivated person more navigational wisdom.",

    "content": "Nail on the head. I think I had mentioned this in a previous post, but these days notes tend to come in real time -- via text messages, dropbox comments, or sometimes even thoughtful emails. I'll usually take a quick glance, but then dump everything into a note file so I have everything in one place when I sit to do the revision. This can be useful when you'll get a thread of notes like 1) I'm not sure about the drum sound, it feel so x... then 2) someone else will chime in saying I love the drums! I think x is the problem then 3) first person is hesitant and shrugs of their not, even though it may still bother them. That way I can try and string together some sort of move that will hopefully make everyone happy. If you're dealing with a band -- and you're producing/engineering -- you'll have had the benefit of seeing the dynamic. Sometimes you get some people that are more engaged and tweaky, others that are unsure of EVERYTHING, and then people that when they say something, they're usually right, as infrequent as that may be. This is very useful during mix notes time because you have context. If you're just getting flies flown to you and you've never met the band/artist, thats certainly a bit more of a challenge and will likely require more work on your end to smooth things out.",

I\u2019d take recall notes and print stems/various mixes and he and the band would go have lunch/dinner. Seeing him repeatedly just crank on shit until it sounded compelling was huge.

After a few takes there'd be a pause while he waited for judgement from the control room. Eventually Dylan stepped out into the live room and got right up into the guy's face and said something really condescending to him about when to play. As Dylan turned away the guy describes having \"nothing but contempt for Dylan in that moment\" and he got super defiant and went into \"Fuck you, Dylan\" mode on the next take. Once the take was done he was left in silence to wonder. And as he squinted into the control room he could see everyone laughing their asses off. Apparently the whole think was a ruse by the control room to get a certain performance out of him.",

I don\u2019t know how I could pull all of those disciplines off in the same space without feeling like I\u2019m making a compromise somewhere.

    "content": "American patriotism takes a lot of different forms. There is a certain amount of pride about the country that I find to well-earned and genuinely proud about. But depending on your social circles you're just as likely to find some people who take it way too far, and that's something that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It gets pretty chauvinistic.\n\nPatriotic rhetoric ends up being a lever used by politicians and adjacent political influencers to rally people to their causes (no surprise there), but lately it's mutated into a particularly ugly form and now there's a stark divide between people who have been radicalized towards extreme political positions and those who would reject them. One group unite under this brand of souped-up patriotism and the other tends to reject patriotic displays entirely because it resembles the first group.\n\nNo doubt you can find this behavior in lots of places around the world, but America's been feeling extremely polarized lately and overt national pride ends up being a symbol that's been co-opted by one group. So people here can be squeamish about it.\n\nYou'll likely be fine if you want to fly your American flag proudly. I don't want to dissuade you. Only highlight a little of our cultural baggage around that topic.",

The origin of the name \"XLR\" is not clear and there are several theories about its meaning. Some people believe it stands for \"X\" connector, others believe it stands for \"Cannon XLR\" or \"Circular XLR.\" However, the name has become synonymous with a type of professional audio connector and is widely used to describe the type of connector regardless of the manufacturer.\n\ndaverat\nThe XLR connector was originally made by ITT Cannon. In their product data sheet they say the X stands for X series, L stands for Latch, and R stands for Resilient. Are you able to confirm that?\n\nChatGPT\nYes, that is correct. The XLR connector was indeed originally developed and produced by ITT Cannon, and the letters in the acronym \"XLR\" do stand for \"X-series, Latch, Resilient.\" Thank you for clarifying this information.\n\ndaverat\nIt is a common misunderstanding that XLR stands for eXternal Line Return\n\nChat GPT\nYes, that is correct. The commonly held belief that XLR stands for \"eXternal Line Return\" is a misnomer. The true origin of the name XLR as described by ITT Cannon is \"X-series, Latch, Resilient.\" This information has been widely misunderstood and misconstrued over time leading to the widely held but incorrect belief that XLR stands for \"eXternal Line Return\".\n\ndaverat\nWhat Does XLR stand for?\n\nChatGPT\nXLR stands for \"X-series, Latch, Resilient.\" It was originally developed and produced by ITT Cannon as a type of professional audio connector.\n\ndaverat\nOh, really?\n\nChatGPT\nYes, that is correct. The XLR connector was developed and produced by ITT Cannon and the letters in the acronym \"XLR\" stand for \"X-series, Latch, Resilient.\" This information has been widely accepted and is commonly referenced in the audio industry.\n\ndaverat\nThis is good info\n\nChatGPT\nI'm glad you found the information helpful!

I get wanting to be apart of the creative process, but your part is to capture, not to impose. \n\nSecondly, the minute you start focusing on vocal techniques, its gonna distract you from the things that actually matter. Things like vibe and being a good hang. \n\nThird: singing ideas *at* a vocalist is not nearly as effective as you might think. However good a singer you are, when you sing an idea they\u2019re going to hear so much more than you intend, and will likely mimic things you\u2019re not trying to convey. It can be more detrimental than you\u2019d think. \n\nAll that said- focus on learning each artist individually, create an environment of trust and respect, and when the time is right, you\u2019ll know how  to offer insight.

Totally understand the hesitation to delegate - especially that first 6 months-a year where you're acutely aware that helping someone else do it is *more work* than just rolling up your sleeves and doing it yourself. \n\nFor building systems, what's worked for me is hiring and training your 'double(s)' first - someone with a similar skillset and sensibilities, very broad skills like me (who also did everything myself for a long time). This comes a lot easier if you have close friends in the same lane looking for jobs, I've seen people have their \"double(s)\" move in with them for a limited time too, with the intention of them soaking in exactly all you do.\n\nOnce my double(s) started doing pretty well, we started hiring more specialized people, and the doubles could then oversee their work, feedback etc - early on I would always be part of this, then slowly phase myself out.\n\nWhat I wish I would have done earlier would have been to hire a producer/overseer/manager/'my boss' - someone with a bit more skin in the game/responsibility, and who keeps you in line if you start wavering. \n\nAgain, I didn't love the setup of 10 and dissolved it eventually - as a creative it's easy to feel like you built a house/efficiency machine and one day you wake up and it's a prison that's not as flexible as you want. That's another thing I'm trying to keep in mind (I'm putting together a new similar team for this fall) - how do you keep the team agile and ready to shift when priorities shift? It could be as easy as accepting a little bit more churn & letting people go when they don't fit what's going on, but it's hard to let go of people you've trained and know well. I felt a friendship connection with my entire team, in hindsight I think that was a mistake too.\n\nThose are some thoughts haha - what have you found so far? Are you experiences lining up with mine? What kind of roles are you hiring for?",

I quit my first commercial/post production gig doing ads full time. It was the worst but I was determined to keep working in music, and try to get integrated in the scene/studio world. It was a serious low for my mental health, the job was terrible, I was struggling and scraping by without any pay off. To make a long story short, I applied for a job back home at a big corporate company with a full time composition/post production gig, on a whim - I didn\u2019t think it would get me anywhere. 3 months later I got the job and went back home after a year. I was out of the music scene back home at this point, and it took another year of reconnecting and working hard on my craft with friends who were willing to let me record their bands for the price  of drums heads and guitar strings, and honestly, those two things combined with some luck put me in a very secure and creative place, now making records for bands again that are paying decently well to boot. I don\u2019t know how far you are in your career/journey, but I\u2019m barely anything and have been recording for 15 years. It took me 5 years out of school to get barely a living wage and working lots of different types of audio jobs while making records, to get to a comfortable place emotionally, creatively, and financially. I\u2019d bet almost anybody in this discord has a very similar story. It takes a long time and like others have said, there\u2019s no one way to get there. Just keep doing you and trying to work on things that you enjoy.",

But his setup was just incredibly different than mine; he uses Studio One, I use pro tools (he\u2019s also used to Pro tools and recently bailed on it). He\u2019s using a combo of Antelope Discrete 8 and an Audient ASP880 and some good outboard pres (Vintech and Summit audio). His monitoring killed me, some small dynaudios which sounded okay and some ProAc\u2019s. He had some decent mics. I brought my 8 Channels of UTA and a bunch of mics and was there just to put our heads together, and I was going mostly press record so he could drum for his bands record.\n\nAnyway, we spent about 4+ hours trouble shooting Studio One, his computer, and the interfaces -eventually finding out one of his AD/DA channels was so messed up it sounded like a ribbon mic when it was a condenser. A lot of his mic stands and cables were really junky - he didn\u2019t have enough of the basics on his own.\n\nSo many things were just not working as I would expect - my UTA preamps were set at much lower gains than I do at my studio because of his gear. I\u2019m basically ear-blind because of the monitoring, even with headphones, and I\u2019m working in Studio One so I can barely focus on the sound. And he used a normal Apple mouse, I use a trackball. \n\nIm trying not to complain, but it just blew my mind how much of an uphill battle recording can be just because of simple things being so taxing. We spent about an hour of the 6 hours I was there tracking one song. The rest was setup. It made me realize why we put so much work into making our process simple and getting gear that is effective and reliable.",

    "content": "In the Bay Area here and have worked another job since Covid. It\u2019s honestly a dream gig when it comes to production and music. It\u2019s completely remote, no set hours, salary/insurance, and I use Pro Tools for the gig so it\u2019s not completely foreign territory. Every remote gig is different and I realize this situation is a lot of luck and circumstance. Don\u2019t be discouraged to take another gig. I was able to pay off high interest cards and can comfortably afford gear when I want it. I was full time in the studio from age 14-31 no other job. It was a transition, but one I\u2019m glad I made. I\u2019m still working mixing full time as well. I do production if I\u2019m stoked on the project. I work with rock bands for context. Just do dope work try not to compare. Remember there are some people with mountains of gear and dope setups they own. much respect to that. Others have rich parents, high interest credit debt, or both. I told myself if I wasn\u2019t rolling in it with a Grammy at 30 I would stop which is a super dumb mindset. I love making records more than anything and getting another gig allows me to keep doing it. Rant over best of luck to everyone \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd",

This kind of timing comes with repetition and developing your focus to be able to work clearly and with intention. I used to work on songs to make progress but now I work on songs to finish them - that was an important mindset change that I needed to make to get stuff done and finished. Also learning to not be so precious with every song has also helped a ton with writing and finishing more tracks",

(and the big juicy cherry on top \u2014 that album led to my first deal, which is how i broke out of the restaurant, and it still accounts for close to 50% of my yearly income in royalties)  i\u2019m just speaking from personal experience knowing exactly where you\u2019re coming from. i don\u2019t have a family, so i can\u2019t say i relate, but i definitely understand what you\u2019re sharing with us. and to push back on some other points made earlier in this thread, i was actually able to love and feel fulfilled by my service job, even though it kinda sucked, because i knew it was what bought me the time and life to make my favorite record.",

    "content": "I know I'm an outlier here as a composer, but I very much feel the spirit of the question and would like to offer a few thoughts. My job is about realizing someone else's vision and pushing that to be the best it can be. If you're being hired as a producer, then like me, you have to believe that you're being hired for your taste and perspective. So the question is, why doesn't it feel good to you? Is there something undiscovered that could make it better?\n\nI've written a lot of music that's outside of my aesthetic or personal tastes. But if I'm on the project, I'm going to be 100% invested in helping make that thing what it needs to be. There's a way into music that's outside of your vibe - sometimes it's getting excited about new techniques, sometimes it's exploring a genre you're unfamiliar with, and sometimes it's just because the people you're making music with are a good hang. Sometimes, the role of a composer (or producer) is to take their vision and find the version of it that **does **get you excited. We've probably all had that experience of \"I really never listen to X, but this one song/artist is just undeniable.\" So strive for that.",

I move slowly and make sure I understand before I move on. It may take two months to complete, but I'm steady with it and I do a little bit most days. It's common for me to transcribe notes from high-density talks that I want to learn from and revisit them often over the span of a week. I'm constantly printing out my notes and reading material so that they're easy to revisit throughout the week.\n\nI'm currently taking a project management course through MIT, which has been great. It's uncommon for me to do formal schooling these days, but this is work related and a direct application to my future capabilities that we thought would be beneficial for the company.\n\nWhen I buy a new plugin (rare) I set aside time to go through it and turn every knob and try each feature to see what it's capable of. Learning a tool on the spot is a good way to kill the creative flow, so I do the exploration up-front when possible.\n\nOften I'll have ideas for novel ways to use a tool (layering distortion, for example) and I'll set aside two hours to explore it and see what I find.\n\nThat said, I think my day-to-day may be quite different from a lot of folks here. My eggs aren't all in the business and pressures of record production, and so I rarely find myself buried in such commitments. I tend to keep \"normal\" business hours these days and keep a hard separation between my commitments and my leisure.\n\nIn fact I'd say that I'm actively structuring my life so that I can retain my leisure and don't find myself overwhelmed with commitments. That's a whole other story, though.",

First of all, great record / artist. I checked out his Spotify and saw that he had no music out before this album. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but my understanding is that he got some tik tok traction then went on the road with Zach Bryan before any of his stuff was out? Was so stoked to see the amount of excitement around an artist\u2019s first release (which is so sick that his first release was an album as well). This might be a hot take, but I think I\u2019m a pretty big fan of the way tik tok has impacted music discovery. Obviously it\u2019s not perfect or going to satisfy everyone, but it\u2019s pretty awesome that all the doors are wide open. And I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a bigger interest in songs, writing, lyrics, etc. From what I\u2019ve heard, it sounds like people got to know some of these Joshua Slone songs well enough to be singing along at his live shows, and I would dare to attribute that to the fact that his lyrics are literally on the screen in his videos. Who knows, maybe that\u2019s all bull shit lol, but wanted to throw it out there. Would love to hear y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts.",

    "content": "As a concept , I think \u201ctruth \u201c is a tricky thing to pin down . It can\u2019t really exist without its relationship to time . Truth changes with time . Imho. \n\nThat said , I fully believe music contains archetypes , sacred geometries and of course waves themselves ,\u2026..that are essentially the cosmos breathing and manifesting . That maths , physics and music all relate to each other , that natures forms , in patterns like the golden ratio to be found in a fern , or an excellent arrangement of a song , that sound and light energy all share phenomena \u2026.these things , the patterns , the scales , the ratios and then the ancestral mind and genetic memory , the ancient truths , instincts , symbolic folklore and intuitions \u2026.as Blake called it \u2026..our imaginations being the direct experience of nature itself \u2026.\n\nWhen someone taps into that and writes something that speaks from and aligns those realms \u2026..\n\nWhatever the message is , that\u2019s what hits \u2026.its an undeniable connection that we share as humans and brought into communion by the music . \nFor good and bad \n\nThat shout example s a good one Ruairi\n\nAnd also everybody wants to rule the world . \n\nThe arpeggio signals something universal as much as the lyrics \n\nIt\u2019s a timeless voice that music unlocks inside us all . \n\nThat\u2019s my take on \u201ctruth \u201c in a song . And like Cian said , it gives me a profound feeling. It\u2019s so exciting and thank goodness for music . It\u2019s such a magic gift",

    "content": "Well, it's hard to say what's best without a more holistic understanding of who you are and your circumstances, so I\u2019m reluctant to offer any hard suggestions. Making a career in the music industry is what engineers would call a \"wicked\" problem. It's not something that has a repeatable solution, and what works for someone rarely works the same way for the next person.\n\nThat said, I see that you\u2019re from Boston. I lived there for seven years, and the talent pool in that city is tremendous. I think if you found yourself back home in Boston it would be a worthwhile investment to integrate yourself into the scene of young musicians that are centered around the schools in the Back Bay like Berklee, NEC, and Boston Conservatory. There are some immensely talented, diverse, and creative people from all around the world based at those institutions and they all exist within 8 blocks of each other. It\u2019s rare to have such a concentration of driven musicians all mingling amongst each other. This is a massive resource that you can tap into. They're *all* trying to make something great and explore what's possible.\n\nIt's a unique opportunity to discover collaborators, build relationships, earn experience in your craft, and build strong connections for the future as you grow alongside these people. On top of that, Boston has numerous recording studios where you can intern and assist. There\u2019s a lot of experience to be gained working in a studio that simply won\u2019t be taught to you in a recording program. Supplement that practical experience with hard work, and some book learning and you can do very well for yourself.\n\nThere\u2019s more that I\u2019m not touching-on, but I think if you ended up back in Boston it not be as much as a trade-off as you may think.",

Learning how to have difficult discussions (even just learning 10 different ways to communicate \"that still isn't good, let's do another take\") is such a huge part of what we do. But honest, open communication is almost always the best solution. \n\nThe only other thing I'll add regarding @Zack Hames's initial question is that I find it super valuable to continue to do all kinds of different roles. If I've mostly been programming and finishing productions, I'll take some time to write a song and sing it myself, so I stay \"in shape\" with writing and recording vocals. If I don't do something myself, how can I empathize with someone? My communication style is always one of \"I know how you're feeling and you can trust me because I've done it a ton.\"",

    "content": "In my experience, if I\u2019m mixing and not also producing, there\u2019s almost always (maybe just always always?) someone who can act as a tie breaker. The producer, lead singer/songwriter, guitar dude who is clearly leading the charge creatively, a manager, etc. etc. who you can turn to in order to give definitive direction... maybe during covid this is more difficult as I feel that often can become clear organically in the room.\n\nIf it\u2019s truly a situation where there are contradictory/unproductive notes coming in, maybe either a) tell them they need to decide amongst themselves and then give you a clear list of notes, or b) take the lead yourself and really push for what you feel serves the song best/explain why the sax can\u2019t be 10x louder than the lead vocal? Which option is best I\u2019d say depends on your relationship with them, how much of a lead you want to take creatively, how confident you are in making the right choices for this song, etc. etc.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @cian riordan might have better advise for these situations!",

But 50% of my music income are gigs that I\u2019m taking to pay the bills, the rest are projects that I feel somewhat passionate, or very passionate about. \n\nThe living expenses have increased due to inflation and I\u2019m also trying to save up money to get a car, so I am thinking about quitting my current day job to get another day job that will give me more hours. \n\nOn months that I couldn\u2019t make my ends meet, I did little things like snow shoveling for neighbors\u2019 houses. I have not done lawn mowing but any one time gig with no schedule commitment can be a good option. The reason why I had to do this is because my day job wouldn\u2019t give me any more hours. \n\nMy issue lately has been the fact that I live in a very expensive city (Boston, MA), and I am barely making it work. More than 50% of the work I do heavily relies on being on-site (recording, live sound, and some parts of the production process).  If I moved further out from the city- the rent would not get cheaper enough to justify getting a car for the commute.

    "content": "Yes. The same way you do anything in life you want to get good at. Spend a shit load of time doing that thing. There really are no hacks or work arounds if you want to actually get good. An easy free way to do it is just learn as many songs as you can. If you want to really be proficient in the musical language I would recommend learning stuff by ear. It takes a lot longer than looking up tutorials or sheet music. But I promise you will develop your ears infinitely more. Specially in the beginning. Music is a language. Every human being learns to speak and converse before they learn how to spell and know the rules of grammar. Learning theory will only let you put names to sounds so that you can convey musical ideas to their people. Contrary to what a lot of people think, there are no rules, but there are a lot of conventions and traditions, but they keep changing and have lots of exceptions. Learning a shit ton of songs on whatever instrument you choose, will teach you what those conventions are and how to use them. \n\nIn the beginning it\u2019s good to just learn every song you like as well as you can, because it will help keep you motivated as you like the music. Then after a while you will probably want to branch out and try stuff you\u2019ve never listened to or enjoyed before just to challenge yourself. \n\nThe most musical people I know, are the people who wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a Caugmented#9 but can listen to a song once and play it nearly perfectly, because their ears and musical language is so developed from playing a fuck lot of music and not spending time reading about it or watching endless tutorials.",

If some one wants to pay so they can get a recording of some art they like, that\u2019s fair and the creator/distributor should def be compensated for expenses and what ever value is put upon said art. But being entitled to money because you made some music, is a little mad to me.\n\nI get being payed for a service, mixing, mastering, producing, writing for other people. But one can never expect a payment just for making something. But for some reason, it is not unseen. But the people who feel like that, are usually the same people to write \u201cdo you know who I am\u201d in an email once the word budget comes up.",

Having started as an intern, becoming an assistant after a few sessions and only later into engineering new projects and running my own sessions at the studio I work at nowadays, it's really clear to me that is you succeed at being a good assistant, people will trust you and you will be blessed with an opportunity to learn and evolve in a totally different and better way... I still assist some of the my colleague senior engineers and engineers that come to the studio for their own sessions, and I'm always eager to be on that spot... If you're that good and keep your mouth shut, you can only win - either by knowing the coolest people in the industry, by learning the craft, by learning how different people do their thing, different mindsets... And you REALLY learn what it takes for a session to run smoothly and for people to be comfortable in the studio, which will probably be the best skill you'll ever develop in this career... \n\nBeing an assistant is great, and all the assistants I know are usually the coolest people to hang with (and yes, I'm including myself, of course \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude02)",

E.g. \"Today we're going to record ourselves speaking\" - briefly introduce how a microphone works, what a preamp is, and then get them recording each other. Same with EQ, Compressor, Reverb, Delay, etc.\n\n- Use as many examples from current pop music as possible. Does someone in the class sing or rap? Have the students go through assembling a vocal chain with a compressor, EQ, etc. and record part of a song.\n\n- Don't get too far in the weeds where it's not necessary. High schoolers DO need to know why we have different sample rates and bit depths. They DON'T need to know about aliasing, oversampling, clocking, or dither algorithms.\n\n- Bring history in for context, but don't dwell on it. It's cool to know that we used to need a speaker in an echoey room or a giant metal plate to make a reverb, but focus on how and why they're using effects rather than where they came from",

Wherever it got into any perceived sense of entitlement , was off track as the core of the question was about leveraging and better pay/benefits for the successful elite (nothing to do with people striving to get there ) . It wasn\u2019t a question about working hard.....or having talent......or how to share a pie and how much pie there is ......that\u2019s all a given in the original discussion I referenced that was between two Grammy winning engineers.  It was a discussion about marketing and the idea of engineers  leveraging for more as a community looking forwards . One  platform was mentioned here earlier that I have experience with.......and they are definitely driving value down with their marketing.  Through the history of time workers have had to fight for more (pay/benefits/better working conditions / contracts ) and imho that\u2019s a legitimate and beneficial force in society. Noam Chomsky describes a point at which society collapses is when the imbalance of the societal structure is such that the vast majority of the workforce can no longer afford to live . In the uk we are currently experiencing strikes across many services/industries. It\u2019s not really my way to say if they are write or wrong ......but I think the concept of unionising and leveraging for \u201cfairer/better :::::whatever you like \u201c is legitimate not entitled or moany  . The suffragettes did it ......I digress. I think IME it\u2019s a fair observation that people employed on the business side of the music business in the big music companies in the  uk work with the expectation that this will result in take home regular pay, without fear of non-payment , working with full benefits re\u2019 holiday pay , maternity pay , etc etc.......",

When doing it this way MD  stand-alone has the edge over the plug-in because it\u2019s all right there in front of me. It\u2019s easy to visually reference a quad tracked lead vocal, and then align and de ess or consonant 8 harmonies. That\u2019s where the stand-alone really shines, is massively dense stacks vocals like that, and not having to keep opening up a plug-in to change a different part or vibrato or formant of a particular track  of the stack or what not. Especially once you get the groove locked in on the lead, it\u2019s just so easy to make all other 30 tracks lock in with it. \n\nFor a solo vocal soul song? I\u2019m probably just audio suiting AT in graph mode in PT. It ultimately sounds the best.",

In some cases, even the intended audience. with that said, if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. \n\n/ might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it. \n\nso who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. \n\nthis is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world. but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

I would do my best to keep things moving, but if the drama made things take longer + cost more, that was on them.\n\nAnd then once that was clear, I did my best to keep being supportive to the music + the musicians.",

When the production company wants world-class sound, and it's your job to create the budget...   knowing that sample libraries can only take you so far is key to explaining to the client WHY they should allocate budget for humans. \"I can create this with just the computer, and it will sound great....  but it won't sound like your example.  There's a real VALUE to humans playing the music and that extra 10% of the quality you're looking for requires a studio session with real players\" \n\nInstant path to budget upgrade.  Suddenly the expense makes sense to them.  Now you get the pleasure of hiring all your friends and deliverying something that sounds top notch...  and you can take the client on a mind-blowing field-trip.  It took me years to learn this trick...   clients don't want to pay mountains of money extra for you to sit in front of your computer and massage CC lanes....  and if they have a mindblowing time in the studio and the track sounds ALIVE?  You win six different ways.",

There is also a lot of pushing and pulling the artists to fit their expectations instead of serving the art and letting nature take its course. Specifically theres a lot of \"I can't wait to help you realize the full expression of your music and art when we work together!!!!!!!!\" kind of vibe which is great internally but puts off older artists a little bit. I've seen it a lot over the last couple years with young producers and engineers and I wonder if its because of the pandemic, honestly. The whole \"check list to success\" thing is another good point. Some things are not easily repeatable or scalable with the expectation of the same result every time.",

Usually the questions don't follow from, or relate to each other which ends up with the \"knowledge\" being disembodied surface level data at best and it doesn't seem like it's even relevant to them  that what they're learning is applicable to the real world\n\nThis has gotta be one of the worse ways to learn imo, typically you'll see the same person asking the same question a week later with no memory of what they'd learnt or why it's even relevant, there's zero chance of this kind of approach getting you \"knowledge\" that you can actually implement which should be the goal\n\nI like Andrejs post a lot, esp when it seems like the bulk of the world is loosing their value in doing the more difficult and meaningful things in life, along with their attention spans",

The reality is, for a lot of artists, we may be their first recording experience, their first record, etc and they\u2019ll grow a LOT during and move on and grow. I think this was mentioned In the Conversations podcast. So for me sometimes it\u2019s letting certain things go that aren\u2019t going to change in someones performance and trying to make it work. I did a pretty emo influenced record recently, and the vocalist isn\u2019t the best. I tried to give him tons of vocal tips and train him the best I could, and it ultimately made it so much harder to record him because it sounded so unnatural and unemotional. We ended up using a lot of earlier scratch takes for certain songs (and they feel super good/relatable/captivating even though it\u2019s maybe nasally) and then using particularly emotional driven takes at the very end. I think there\u2019s a balance of being honest/giving feedback and being delicate/not destructive in your response.

My two cents: if there isn\u2019t a designated producer in the room and you\u2019re fulfilling both the engineer/producer roles then trying to get from load in to recording as quickly as possible seems to work well - that way they can be witness and collaborator to any sonic changes. Like someone was talking about a producer who just dampened the toms right away - maybe that was necessary but if the artist hasn\u2019t heard both options in the same room on the same song then they\u2019re left with nothing but faith that this is the right decision. But if you just start recording quickly and then chime in with \u201chey, I feel like maybe the toms are ringing out for too long, can we try dampening them on this next take?\u201d They\u2019re probably more likely to try it out.",

The gist of it is that we (humans) hear a balance of frequencies differently depending on how loud or how soft the sound is. This affects our ability to accurately judge what the actual balance of a record's frequencies are and make good decisions about a mix. These researchers (Fletcher and Munson) did a lot of research and came up with a chart that shows how our perception of sound changes depending on how loud a sound is. The general takeaway from looking at these results is that we perceive sound as closest to neutral/flat when listening around 80dB and thus it is the least compromised level to listen at.",

    "content": "Hey all! Been loving the live shows but fairly new to the server so feel free to point me in the right direction if there's a better thread for my question. Wondering what tools and habits people are using for medium to long term planning and vision casting, for lack of a better term, especially when busy?\n\nHad what I would consider my first really busy year as a producer last year. Worked on 75 songs, most of them full instrumental productions taking them from a demo, playing / recording everything, and often mixing. It was a really exciting year but I found I spent most of the time being reactive, rather than proactive, just trying to stay on top of getting things out the door on time! \n\nWhat do y'all do to make sure you get time thinking about what you'd like to see happen in your career (everything from people you want to work with, music you want to create, gear you want to purchase), and organize it in an actionable way so that your time spent making stuff for other people also takes you where you want to go long-term? Thanks!",

It would obviously be, well, NOT exactly that, but unless you\u2019re primarily listening to and working on jazz or classical, what we all do is *hugely* influenced by the technology and process of recording.

The room is gonna be important because the violins sound doesn\u2019t fully develop until at least 4-6\u2019 from the instrument, so if you want a balanced tone without room, you have to kinda chase that sweet spot.\n\nI\u2019ve used Ribbons and SDCs, Ribbons are nice and smooth sounding which takes the bow sound if you have to get closer to the instrument, where an SDC gets lots of the bow hair scratching over the strings which can be a perfect for a \u201cfiddle\u201d track in bluegrass if that\u2019s the style of violin that\u2019s being played.\n\nYou can use a ribbon, but you need a lot of clean gain otherwise it\u2019ll get noisy, violin isn\u2019t particularly loud, that\u2019s why in an orchestra there\u2019s so many of them.",

Either way I think he said his main takeaway is that recording and mixing make way more of an impact but it is really amazing to see the difference all in one place.

I think that if the band  utilizes your space to produce and record, that it may be more fulfilling to take care of getting your space capable of putting together the full production with creative projects (and potentially more fulfilling).\nIf you\u2019re already having business come in (40% mastering), then that probably won\u2019t change too much in the time it\u2019ll take you to reach a place to invest in bigger mastering gear afterward.

I\u2019m a young person in early 20s, so also seeking advice/people\u2019s thoughts on this.\n\nWouldn\u2019t you say it would be better to be decent at all of the things mentioned above for paths like producer? It isn\u2019t required to be good at all of things because hiring other people is always an option, but starting out- I\u2019m working with projects with lower budgets where people can barely afford to hire a producer. \n\nI want to have one strong path, and strength within those skill sets- but I feel like being well rounded wouldn\u2019t hurt if there is one clear path I want to work on. And it seems to me that the path encompasses many different skills. For example, I would work on my instrumental skills, engineering skills, and arrangement skills- but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily seek to pursue these career paths unless I was asked to because I know that primary focus is in production. I would still take gigs in different areas if the pay my bills, but if I get to a point where I can make full living exclusively from production work- I will not take other gigs unless I\u2019m passionate enough to the point I wouldn\u2019t mind doing them for free. To sum up my thoughts or desires on this- I want to build proficiencies in all areas because I believe they are part of the path I want to go through. Although I wouldn\u2019t necessarily pursue a career in those areas I\u2019m developing but I will still take the gigs until I\u2019m paying all my bills and able to build proper savings solely from one thing I would ultimately want to do. \n\nIt may sound like I\u2019ve already made up my mind, but I\u2019m eager to hear people\u2019s thoughts on this because this is something I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time especially because I hear people say \u201cniche down\u201d or \u201cfocus on one thing\u201d.",

    "content": "From my experience of going to music school and taking a whole bunch of courses that are all over the place in terms of lane of focus- school can offer almost too much. It helps to take some time to digest the information, I had this issue when I was in college and had a chat with some of the graduates and they said it took them years after graduating to decompose information that was learned. If you have doubts on if you should continue it may be useful to take some time off and spend on doing what you wanted to do, continuing to connect with people, or even just take breaks altogether to take a breeze of fresh air, live in outside world. Being in school kind of made me live in a bubble and getting out of that was really precious to me. \n\nDegree is just a piece of paper but academic settings can widen horizons of what you can access on your own in the future without having to rely on someone to feed the knowledge/information. It was very chaotic when I took a whole bunch of unrelated courses in college but they all offered me wide insights on what I could dig deeper into in the future. Did I transform as much as others that focused on one lane (eg. engineering) - then I would say no but I created my own program to gain things that would take me more than a decade to have access to. I wasn\u2019t able to retain everything but it unlocked the ways so I can go there when I need to. \n\nIt always sucked having no time to work on my own stuff, but I saw it as a training period  of my life rather than practical period of life. \n\nMy case is slightly different than yours because I went to college straight without having much real world experience. But TLDR; I think semester or a year off would give you what you need without aborting any of the options!",

    "content": "> There was a noticeable number of US clients (artists + their entourages, certain producers, and especially writers - usually in pop or hip hop) who treated assistants like \u201cthe help\u201d / waiting staff / taxi drivers / some menial worker they felt was beneath them. The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nI want to add to what Ruair\u00ed and Matt B said with another perspective. I've had the privilege of working in some very professional settings, where everyone needs to fade into the background to do their jobs properly, and that's absolutely the case at higher levels. And it makes things work. And everyone's cool about it.\n\nBut much of my work has been as producer, assistant producer or project manager/fixer for people working at decidedly lower levels. \n\nAnd idk how it is in other countries, but we have a glut of people here in the US who have a certificate from a for-profit recording school that says they know what they're doing, who think they're *the shit* for being in the room with some viral star off YouTube/Instagram/TikTok. But don't know how to use a damn patch bay. \n\nAnd when you're on the come up, especially as a writer or producer, you interact with a lot of these people, and you get REALLY sick of them REALLY fast. So that might be the source of some of the condescension you see. It's hard not to get jaded when you have to wade through so much incompetence.

It was very clear that I was there to sit in the back of the room until I was asked to do something\u2026 order food, help with a mic setup, shuffle cars in the parking lot, etc. Not to mention working for someone like Eric who is extremely self sufficient\u2026 he was terrible at asking me to do things. It was always just quicker for him to do it\u2026 even if it meant getting up from the seat and walking all the way across the studio to adjust something. I made the absolute mistake in my second or third week of suggesting something to the drummer in the band after a performance. Eric overheard and pulled me aside. Basically said something along the lines of \u201cyo, you really can\u2019t do that. If you have an idea, run it through me. Absolutely inappropriate, however well intentioned it was. This was really deflating to me. I went from running the show at my own place to spending 14 hrs a day waiting for something to do.",

There was a bit of \u201clemme see if I can do that\u201d out of sheer boredom.\n3) THEORETICALLY, the trackpad offers a higher ceiling than the trackball, especially with better touch tool. The way I worked on the trackball was using the buttons to swap through tools and it allowed me to work really really quick. The track pad has WAY more ways to chord and double/triple 2/3/4/5 finger tap/swipe to program oft used key commands. I\u2019m giving it a year or two to become intuitive.",

    "content": "So sound is captured as electrical signals by disturbing a magnetic field (or in the case of condenser mics, changing the voltage potential across a specially tuned capacitor), which generates an AC voltage corresponding to the compressions and rarefactions in the air. This is a whole topic on its own but tl;dr for dynamics you're moving a magnet back and forth inside a coil of wire, with ribbons you're moving the wire back and forth inside a magnetic field, guitar and bass pickup you're disturbing a magnetic field with vibrating ferromagnetic strings... anyway. \n\nLinear voltage amplifiers (ie class A, and AB for us audio guys) - which we use for mic preamps, line amps, differential amps, power amps, pretty much anything you can think of - work by using an AC voltage to vary DC current flow. In its most basic form, it works like this: That AC signal from the mic or guitar pickup hits either the grid of a vacuum tube or the gate of a FET, and changes the amount of current that flows from one end to the other (usually cathode to plate in a tube, and usually source to drain in FETs). Stick a resistor between the DC power supply rail and the amplifying element and you get a voltage variance because of ohm's law - current goes down, voltage goes up, and vice versa. So, you end up with a bigger version of the input signal, with its polarity inverted. \n\nDistortion is a *way* more complex topic and not one I'm equipped to explain, as I don't understand it very well myself.",

    "content": "Even though I understand where you come from with this - I guess everyone relates and/or feels more emotionally connected with some projects than others - I think we should own what we do. If you're recording/mixing/producing, do it as best as you can. That can mean passing it on to someone else (and handle this part with care, in my opinion, is also a part of the job). But if you end up going all the way, it still is a worthy project, you should still give it 100% of yourself. Learn something new and useful. And if you do, you should be proud of having your name on something you know you gave your best (even if the rest of it wasn't ideal, your part was the best you could do, at least in a certain moment in time).\n\nSo, I'm all for: work in it, own it. But make sure you do your best all the times and always learn something.",

Instead of explaining, it\u2019s better to do it and show it.\n\nMy humble take: our job is not necessarily doing what we\u2019re told. it is to take their vision, and take it to a place where they could say \u201cwow- I didn\u2019t know this is what I wanted but this is what I want now\u201d. Which I think is the taste and perspective factor. \n\nIt is case by case of course and some artists could come in with A to Z manual of what they want, which can be cool- or not. I personally find those boring, unless I really admire their vision and it just feel like an honor to be a part of it. I think being a yes man can be a quick way to become dispensable. But someone who is willing to serve by giving you some friction that can turn into some heat \ud83d\udd25 can be someone they find trustworthy and interesting. It\u2019s case by case dependent, some people need perfect aerodynamics to accelerate their vision, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily being a yes man- but rather about just being the right fit for the project and being someone who is fully on board to do what they are asking. \n\nBut I think more importantly- it\u2019s okay to miss. If they don\u2019t like it - then scrap it or give it another go. And it\u2019s also fine if you end up not being the one for the project",

What they actually do (if they\u2019re good) will likely be different every time.

Younger me had no idea how long it would take to truly become great at something. A lot of emphasis placed here (in a practical and useful way I would add) on honing your skills, getting reps, practice, patience, developing taste, etc... On the journey to great you must survive. The harder it is to survive (i.e. cost of living, shit wages, inflation, healthcare, etc...) the more time you have to spend on survival and the less time you have to develop yourself. I remember when I moved to Nashville in 2011 people called it a five year town now I hear folks saying it's a ten year town. I'm hopeful my cousin, relating back to the OG thread, has the opportunity time affords to take a real crack at it and develop into a great artist if he so chooses.",

The home increased in value quite a bit over that time (more than the historical average) - selling for $110k more than we bought it for. Wow! Huge return on investment right?\n\nAfter the dust has settled and we ran the numbers\u2026.it was a break even with renting. \n\nIf we would have taken that down payment and put it into VOO, we would have come out ahead and spent a lot less blood, sweat and tears. \n\nUltimately, I personally view rent versus own a primarily a lifestyle choice. Owning a home has benefits (and drawbacks) beyond the pure numbers, as does renting\u2026and all of that has to be a part of the equation.",

I had some hiccups with the key lockbox with Turo, had trouble getting ahold of the owner, and the number of pictures you have to take of the care to prove its condition felt like a claim for a new scratch on the vehicle had already begun. Also, gotta consider how you\u2019re getting to your Turo drop point - it was about $50 in Uber rides total to/from the airport in my case (car was ~2 miles away).",

The big takeaways I get  from Kant are him pointing out certain preconditions for the possibility of experience/knowledge at all.\n If those preconditions aren\u2019t the case then experience itself is impossible.\nIn short, if one\u2019s worldview denies the possibility of the things needed for experience or knowledge to be possible, then that person can\u2019t even make knowledge claims at all without being self refuting\n\nHe was trying to respond to Hume after David Hume tried to nuke Metaphysics. \n\nKant like other German idealists is a reallt dense read, a philosophy teacher on YouTube named Daniel Bonevac has some great videos on Kant that distill it down into way more palatable things to chew on if you felt like it.",

They also take URI, which I believe once your song is ingested into Spotify, you can email Spotify For Artists and ask for it. But Hypeddit's free tier can do the scan, the paid tier ($9/month) has more features like pixel tracking and custom domain, branding stuff, etc.",

I blended that with a snare I found in the Linn itself, which was a 12-bit machine, so it sounded pretty edgy to start with.\u201d But the coup de grace for the sound was when Z pumped the processed and blended sample through an Auratone speaker set upside down atop another snare drum, which rattled the metal snares and gave the result some ambience and even more high end. The whole thing was limited slightly and then sent to a track on a roll of Ampex 456 running on a Studer A800 at 15 ips. Only a slight amount of reverb was added to the track later on.",

It's inspiring to see him play with so much care and attention to feel.\n\nI loved hearing him talk about Mutt Lange's approach and how patient Mutt was with every part. Making the players play again and again while waiting for the right confluence of feel to come together before moving on. There's so much care for the moment. That pace is antithetical to the way things are often done today. Understandably so.\n\nOf course, Dann also expresses the feelings of doubt that anyone would go through in his position; wondering what it was about him that wasn't good enough for the take. So I think it's good that Mutt was up-front with the players about how they were going to approach it, which could allow the players to stop thinking about their abilities and sink into the right headspace for such a long endeavor as Mutt explored.",

    "content": "This is an important balance you brought up, we have to constantly find ways of keeping the session flowing but also make sure we take time to get things right.  No one wants to watch someone get drum sounds for hours or any sounds for hours yet we expect the results to sound as if we did.  We have to stay out of the way but always be prepared to catch someone falling.  This job is hard, there are many details that go into making  a session go well.  Id suggest thinking about the things you feel need to go further. Are there ways you can be ahead of the curve ?  Are there ways that you can surprise the room and you can say \u201cI  actually just took care of that, we can move on to the next thing\u201d? We have to be steps ahead of everyone else in the room. Some things do in fact take time and you can decide if doing certain things are disruptive to the flow and you might need to bust it while everyone is getting a coffee or telling the room  \u201c hey gang I need 15 mins to take care of \u2026..\u201d",

So if you like easy grid based edits of overdubs etc it gets a little more complicated than usual . I wasted a bit of time trying to work out the problem then slaving the mpc to daw MTC which then just removes the mpc swing which is counterproductive . So yeah , if at any point it\u2019s gonna be tracked into the daw familiarise and strategise for that asap in the process .",

It\u2019s been my first full band project in a while, I was doing mostly solo artist production (where I had a lot of creative input and played a lot of instruments and was dealing with one persons vision instead of 4).",

Was able to relax and feel confident I could make ends meet. Then I blew it all up and moved to LA to start over again! Ha.

You'll likely get better sonic results if you can find a room with some more volume... that will also allow you to play with position in front of the microphone. As far as the level you should record at, if you've got any half-decent mic pre than you can go into the computer pretty conservatively. Assuming you don't have a super noisy chain, there'll be plenty of headroom in a 24 bit recording to bring it up after the fact. If you're looking for numbers, I'd shoot to get things into your DAW at around -18 dBFS. Many of the plugins modeled after analog gear tend to be happier with that level (or less if you're unsure).",

Now many bands do that already, but they combined multiple takes for each *song.*  They'd take the chorus from Night 1 and splice it onto the second verse of night 4 and then do the outro from Night 7. The cool part was that the recordings, rooms, and audience are drastically different, so you end up with lots of cool sonic shifts on the downbeats of each section in the songs.",

    "content": "I agree with matt that hiring a mastering engineer is a luxury in the present day tbh. Most of the records that I get to mix or produce I'm expected to deliver a finished product ready to release. However when a lot of things are at stake (label release) it's almost 100% sure that a mastering engineer will take care to finish the record, do some QC and especially keep a human touch to the art. Would a co-mixer be able to do that? possibly, depending on their skillset/experience.\n\nwith the use of AI and other systems the expense of hiring a mastering engineer is already fading away but only for projects that are less risky. Say, if you have a tape library of 500 symphonic recordings and need to submit it for streaming so a few folks can listen to it, labels will most likely get an automated system for that to make sure that the standard levels are ok and that it translates well. I'm sure there would be a hungry mastering engineer willing to get that done but the industry is past that era",

    "content": "Do you have any way of recording at home? You mention \"while you are not actually recording\". The best way to practice is to literally do it as often as possible even if it's by yourself. You won't train the social aspect, you won't really train problem solving of an external source (a guitarist with a particularly shitty amp or playing technique per-say), but you can certainly experiment endlessly on capturing sounds. Shootouts, micing techinques, it's pretty much endless. If you don't have a recording setup at home or are in an apartment where you can't be as loud as you'd want, I try to absorb as much information as I can. Podcasts (Andrew Talks to Awesome People / Unstoppable Recording Machine / Working Class Audio / Conversations Audio), Online articles, (Sound on Sound) GearSpace Forum Q+A, TapeOp interviews, Youtube Series (Making Records with EV, Sounds-Like-a-Drum), etc. These can be incredibly inspiring and keep your mind tuned into the recording process.  I sort of use this as my \"fix\" when I am not able to work actively on a project. Otherwise, what everyone else has said about mixing are perfect suggestions. Maybe set limitations like only using plugins you haven't used. or remove a plugin you are constantly using to force yourself out of a habit. Practice editing dramatically even if the track doesn't call for it so you can get your editing chops up.",

Listen to the best sounding records, CONSTANTLY. i find this has had a dramatic affect in \"tuning\" my ears to what sounds REALLY great. If you're going for more the songwriting route this can really start to bite you in the ass because you end up listening to a bunch of steely dan, but there's a always a time to switch back to simply listening music you love because you love it, not because it was an excellent recording.",

I guess it's sort of the noncommital side of me not wanting to abandon my custom PC at home which I know very well and has a clear upgrade path for the future (easily swap in a newer CPU/more memory ETC) whereas I need something that I can take with me on the road.  I think as I learn the limitations of the Macbook I got with the type of processing I normally do I might be able to commit fully to docking the laptop at home.  But yeah long story short it probably comes down to just not wanting to totally abandon the system I had going and try and find some sort of middle ground.",

Unfortunately, my girlfriend is just about the loudest human on the planet when it comes to, for instance, coming home from work in the evening, or making dinner, etc.. When it\u2019s just me working alone (which is the majority of the time), I don\u2019t care and usually take a break when she gets home anyway. But, if I\u2019ve got clients over when she gets home, and they aren\u2019t good friends already, it\u2019s pretty awkward/borderline impossible to be cutting a vocal while it sounds like she\u2019s using a chainsaw upstairs to make dinner.\n\nAnyone have experience with replacing or soundproofing doors? The current door is flimsy and hollow-core, and my guess is replacing it with a solid wood door and sealing well around the edges will help a ton. (There\u2019s a healthy gap at the bottom currently.) Alternately, somewhat curious about this thing: https://residential-acoustics.com/shop/soundproofing/acoustidoor/ \u2026 I have toyed with the idea of completely blocking off the door and just entering/exciting the studio through the exterior door, and one or two of these things could be a decent way to do that with an off the shelf product. (BTW, I\u2019m in a rental.) \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Any thoughts/recs greatly appreciated!",

They\u2019ll sing a normall bass C and then do a slight vocal fry which for some reason our body vibrates a fifth below the note you sing and it produces a note an octave below that you can hear and feel in your chest, without having to sing super low. \n\n\nI cant help but feel there must be some Way to use that concept in a mix to get some crazy subbass with out blowing out your headroom.

To apply that logic to situations beyond the time value of money isn\u2019t the whole picture: that law of economics only compares value, it doesn\u2019t tell us that concentrating labor for short term gains yields the best possible business model. By that logic, there is an argument that everyone\u2019s best business decision is to forego longterm relationship building, knowledge acquisition (which is like R&D for producers), and strictly focus on maximizing immediate sales (which could look like everyone hopping on beatstars, fiverr, and enginears) which would diminish resources like this very discord, and probably a lot of reputations too!",

Rauri and spider chatted with me for I think a couple of hours and it was instrumental in me pushing myself. \n\nThey essentially told me to be in more high stakes situations. Rauri asked how often am \u201cI the smartest or most experienced person in the room?\u201d In regards to producing, etc. almost always - which is the exact problem because it\u2019s not like I\u2019m out here making hits. They were telling me that by working at this lower level, turning C- bands into B- bands, or D+ projects to C+ projects, wasn\u2019t going to get me where I wanted. I need to get in the rooms with higher stakes.\n\nIt took a while but that\u2019s exactly what happened. I\u2019m working with people who are insanely talented musicians and writers, some of which are incredible engineers in their own right, but they do their tracking with me now",

That was indeed the most polished takes and performance they had, and it still needed A LOT of care), a list of reference tracks that wasn't even close in anything to what we had or could ever have, and me wanting not to jump in again on all of that. And during this, I had other people hearing my mix (colleagues) that were harsh on the way they gave feedback - not criticising, I knew it was shite, but I think it was the right thing at the wrong time for me.\n\nAt this point, I was struggling so bad with imposter syndrome, I was seriously considering quitting and getting the blues about the process, not happy with the result but not sure how I could do any better. And yes, I was working on other stuff, but this project was sucking all my energy and mood.\nFeeling like a fraud and a failure. There is no sugar coating it.\nBut most of all, I wanted to make it work for the band. I wanted to give them my best, and wanted really hard that my best could be the best for them. So I kept going, and entered into it. \n\nVersion 2... 7 pages of comments, all on different stuff that I thought we already nailed on the first version, since there was absolutely no comment on those things before... \n\nOh, by the way, by this time, I was still waiting on some dry tracks from the producer, to make moves that the band asked for on the first version review.",

    "content": "Speaking as someone who moved to the US, there are a lot of things that will make you miss Europe sorely. Mainly quality of life things, especially if you're moving to Texas (although ATX is not so bad)\n\nFirst, as people have mentioned, this country is massive. Everything is disproportionately large and far away. You will drive everywhere, which as a German you might not have an issue with, but it gets annoying when you want to pop over to the corner store to grab something and then you remember that doesn't exist, and then you're driving 30 minutes on the highway to the supermarket just to get two things. Normal errands will take you ridiculous amounts of time if you're not in a dense city, particularly east coast cities (NYC ftw)\n\nNext, there's the increasingly Kafkaesque nature of every commercial interaction in the US. People are generally not paid enough relative to their cost of living and are constantly stressed by student debt, credit card debt, auto debt, mortgage debt (if they're lucky enough), etc. As a result, those in many public-facing service jobs do not do their jobs very well. Sorting out a minor problem can easily involve hours of slogging through telephone menus and talking to service reps who can't really help you. An example is it recently took me over a month and 20+ calls to 4 different places to switch my health insurance, which is supposed to take a week at most through an internet portal (Healthcare.gov)",

For me humor is a venue for creative expression,  exploration, and improvisation and for her she\u2019s regularly used it as a way to defuse her own interpersonal situations and assumes that\u2019s where everyone else is coming from.\n\nThis is an assumption that took us a year to uncover and goes to demonstrate how a lot of behavior can go unexamined because we both assume we mean the same thing when we say it.",

To your point @BatMeckley , for where im at in my humble level of the hierarchy, the demo-itis thing has been a real handicap already with regard to what i wanted for a mix/production (its usually mostly with reverb on the vocals for me....I want it drier they want it soaked )  but then i watched Bainz on your live matt , post the Punk album release and he looked like he had PTSD for demoitis , so i figured its par for the course. Overall, i love recording so its not a chore, but sometimes it seems like the artist is getting in their own (and my \"producers's) way)   and  so again, I really appreciate you both sharing your strategies for handling these moments.",

Some of the subjects were audio professionals and some were lay people.\nWhen the subjects listened back to these recordings, there was significant variance in their ability to localize the sound sources. If I remember correctly, they were generally better at listening through their own pinnae than others were, and audio professionals were a bit better at sound localization in general, particularly in the traditional stereo field. However, the really interesting finding was that there were some pinnae that were universally better or worse. People actually had improved localization through someone else\u2019s pinnae than their own, implying that although we are adapted to our own pinnae, there are material differences that make some better than others for localization of sound.\nThis is all from memory of reading something a few months ago, so I apologize if there are details that aren\u2019t 100% accurate, but I assure you that the surprising bit is correct!\n\nHRTF-based binaural mixes are not exactly the same thing as dummy head recordings, but I wonder if, in the creation of the aforementioned \u201cballer individual HRTF\u2019s\u201d there might be a place for some optimization beyond the exact copying of an individual\u2019s unique acoustic properties.",

They've always been a great company, so I'm wary of them placing their fate in someone else's hands. \n\nAlso, they were employee-owned up until this point, so presumably the stakeholders had to sign off on it. Maybe the sale was a necessary step to save the company from falling apart due to financial pressures. I'm speculating.",

    "content": "I think the bigger question is the lack of money in recording business. \n\nNo tangible way of making real money off of it for most people except those who are landing sync placements, which can really be anyone. The way I see it is sync placement is fulfilling more of the utility aspect of art, while making records for people to listen to is a more artistic endeavor in service of the people that listen to the records. But the reality is that everyone\u2019s streaming and that doesn\u2019t pay. Even with the biggest success- it won\u2019t make money correspondent to the level of success. \n\nBudget for record production is now more of a PR for their shows or tours. (As far as what I can tell)\n\nSo why in a sane mind would anyone spend money on making it other than for their own satisfaction? It\u2019d be insane to see making records as business investment unless you\u2019re really aiming for sync in mind. But then, what most of us fell in love with are the amazing records that we grew up listening to. Maybe a song from a movie occasionally, but probably not quite a track from sports spot nor a jingle. \n\nAt this point, is there really a way to monetize real money from records other than sync? If there can be, what would that be?",

I dont disagree with you that what you are both describing is true for where we are at currently and have been for some time. im trying (badly) to not promote my view as opposed to the views shared by the engineers in the discussion im referencing....but fwiw , in 2022 the global recording revenue i think was around 20 billion dollars. Thats a lot of dough. Im not a socialist....im not against the free market.......the discussion was centred around the growing leverage engineers have in the industry and whether that is being marketed effectively to increase the price of the skilled labour engineers provide. When i first started getting indie production deals i was adviesd in the music business, when it comes to discussing deals, everyone's friends...when it comes to paying on those deals......no-one's friends....its only business. I have found this to be true and have no objection to it.",

Then probably you\u2019ll end up saying yes to more things that you would usually swerve.

I try and deal with it preemptively in this way, can it be avoided before we\u2019ve even begun? In which case I\u2019d probably swerve the project. If you\u2019re already in deep and working I\u2019d try and just power through like you said. You can always say no next time. If it\u2019s just not possible to do that and you actually have to get out for the sake of your sanity, it might be worth speaking to the artist and saying \u201chey I\u2019m really sorry but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m best placed here to help you achieve your goals\u201d depending on reasons why you could even recommend someone who might be a better fit (if the person is a total dick I absolutely would not do this)\n\nThat\u2019s really a last resort though. Powering through, learning from it (even just being able to spot these things before they start) and giving yourself the ability to swerve them in the future. \n\nCan I ask what the situation is and what\u2019s making you want to dump the project?\n\nEdit:\nI\u2019ve only ever had to \u2018fire\u2019 one client in my time (it may about to be two) the first time it honestly worked out better for everyone involved.",

Wants to throw away their entire fan base in rock music to do pop (which is pretty damn bold considering they have 2m followers on tiktok lol) and they told me they really want do the blinding lights thing. Which IMO is not a great idea as I think new artists making top 40 sounding tracks is kinda hard to pull off. And then you also have the fact that the whole 80s thing is feeling dated already. I think they need to go more indie since their voice suits the genre and their image won\u2019t have to be tweaked too much and there should be a solid crossover of current fans, but I ain\u2019t the artist here. So I just talked to them about it and told them I\u2019m gonna take a few extra days and make sure this feels right for the above reasons and if they hate it that\u2019s fine we\u2019ll try again until it\u2019s right.

It's like my phone calls have been in the dark ages and now I'm finally in the modern era.\n\nWhich begs the question, why don't phone calls, voicemail, and audio text messages sound this good? \n\nMy guess is that it's some sort of bandwidth limitation because the data transfer protocols were designed and portioned out with decades-old infrastructure in mind. Maybe some latency considerations as well?\n\nAnyone have any insight on this?",

What we needed was another 20 episodes to find a stride, to see what works. \n\nI really want to encourage you to lower the activation energy required for making a podcast if you really want to. Make it take as little time / energy as possible.\n\nDont plan trips to Boston before you\u2019ve even started, cause then you\u2019ll never start.

He (reportedly) earned $7 Million from his music in 2013.  So the ROI couldn't profit until 2037 (without touring income).  His fanbase will be effectively extinct by 2040 and it's going to be hard to break 1980s trends on future generations.

Why can\u2019t we spend our effort into exploring everything in between? \n\nDo everything in between come with labels or do they become lengthy sentences and paragraphs? \n\nI think the answer to all of this is complexity of life that us humans brought onto ourselves.

Many or most don\u2019t have the patience to keep on trying to explore the nuances in between. Or can\u2019t afford to take the time / invest the energy to do so. I believe the lack of dimensions in the new generation\u2019s language is a product of this. \n\n@NoahNeedleman said older, less nuanced in opinion & younger, less nuanced in language. I believe both are true for both younger and older people *if they ended up giving up trying to dig deeper to explore and ponder on \u201ceverything in between\u201d*. I don\u2019t think age has anything to do with it. It\u2019s just that the disparities between those who had the patience for nuance vs those who gave up trying become more apparent as people get older.",

I've owned a home in Portland since 2017 (low interest rate locked in) that i now just rent out, and honestly, its making me sick how much _more_ money i would have made if i had just left my money in stocks instead of used it on the down payment. \n\nIts such a huge hassle and source of stress, so im considering selling it. But idk... diversification and all that jazz.\n\nSo, does anyone have strong feelings on home ownership?",

It piqued my interest as I hitherto believed digital storage represents a much better way to reproduce recordings in the future than a degrading tape . Yesterday I watched rob marksman (mtv news/hip hop journalist ) talking about digital not being permanent and we are at risk of breaking a chain of music histories being passed down in physical formats to generations to come due to streaming . If streaming companies fold in the future , no one would have any music magazines , videos , let alone singles / albums . It made me think of what Steve albini was saying . So at major labels \u2026.are all the master recordings now digital files on a disk somewhere ?",

I don\u2019t know if he would have said that . Those Minnesotan musicians \u2026.prince , jam and Lewis , morris day etc were all as I understand it , living and working musicians \u2026..from the james brown \u201cyou don\u2019t work you don\u2019t eat \u201c musical lineage . Which is to say, music was  a lane in a deeply segregated society that offered you a slim chamce of surviving a dearth of opportunity and finding a living. But goodness me  you had to work for it . All the greats , duke Ellington  Coltrane etc \u2026..through howling wolf , muddy waters chuck berry james brown and up to princes era  , music wasn\u2019t a luxury imho , it was a gift and one you had to hustle hard with to survive . In the spirit of this little video ,  re Prince and his work ethic \u2026 he wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and finished and finished and finished  songs , as did jimmy jam and Terry Lewis . That work ethic that imho accepts you need to work to create brilliance. Hard . I think jam and Lewis said they expect one hit song for about every thirty they wrote and throw away . Constantly . That\u2019s how I read \u201cwork ethic \u201c",

    "content": "Without telling the story about two years ago I had my first \u201cbad\u201d client. They were in the middle of building a house (unknown to me) and decided this would be a great time to manage that project but also make a record with me. Because I was under the impression that studios were financially out of reach for this person, I worked at half my usual rate and allowed them to give me a small deposit to start working together. MY MISTAKE.  Every time they came to the studio they were stressed out and unfocused. I did my best to make their home recordings sound great but there was very little good communication and it ended up that when I sent a mix over, I got a 8 paragraph dump about how nothing is working out, the mix was nothing they would ever release, then proceeded to call me a bunch of names - just taking out all their frustration on me. I zipped up all the work I had done so far and sent it over saying I think it\u2019s best if we went our separate ways, you can do what you like with what we\u2019ve done so far - I don\u2019t want any credits at all. Since then it\u2019s motivated me to make sure that I am following my process and OVERcommunicating every step of the way to be sure there\u2019s no confusion about the work I do with clients. I learned that this former client bad mouthed me to a few artists and I lost some work because of it. Eventually work got back to normal and it\u2019s been steady rocking ever since. The memory of how I felt motivated me everyday to be better than the day before, no joke - I know there\u2019s going to be bad days here and there but I\u2019ll be damned if I ever let someone take advantage of me like that again.",

And I agreed to do the project and set my rate (offered a pretty significant friend discount) under the premise that I would be credited in a certain way. I totally understand that some artists want to be the only producer on their projects and if I was ghost producing a song for someone I would have probably charged a lot more. Either way, that doesn't seem like something that an artist gets to decide on their own after the song has already been completed. In my case I think it was just an honest mistake or he forgot or we had a miscommunication and its an easy thing to check in about and resolve. But it just made me wonder going forward if there is a clearer distinction between the two roles.",

But on this topic, I find it hard/impossible to completely 100% enjoy a piece of work after the artist has done something disagreeable, taken a public downfall or occasionally if I had a negative personal experience with them. Even though I might intellectually appreciate the beauty of the work, my heart just feels a slight bit of ick -- akin to that feeling of trying to enjoy a meal that you know is super delish but you burned your tongue on a hot cup of coffee the day before. So I\u2019ll just end up choosing to listen to something else instead. This also makes me intensely appreciate my past experiences with the art. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever enjoy it the same way again but I\u2019m so glad I was able to completely enjoy Puff Daddy productions, R. Kelly songs, Woody Allen\u2019s movies, Bill Cosby\u2019s comedy, and Kanye West\u2019s early albums when they were coming out and having their day. I\u2019m resolved that it was a time in my life and in the universe and that time might be over now. Kinda like the ex-girl that you remember fondly but would never ever ever go back to.",

    "content": "I think there\u2019s a danger in assuming those that are successful didn\u2019t have it hard.\n2 quick stories that have shaped my career:\n\nvery early on when I was recruited to play in a band in Australia. Sold my car, got rid of my apartment, and flew out to Melbourne. Band had a moment but I got tossed out just as the song was going number 1. Had no money to get home, no where to stay, and was literally 23 living on our producers couch in a country about as far from home as possible. And I called my pop, basically telling him how bummed/scared/fucked I was. And he goes \u201cyou know, I just got off the phone with **** (a very famous actor friend of ours). If there\u2019s anyone that had it all, you\u2019d think it was him. Big career, wife on the cover of sports illustrated swimsuit edition, fans everywhere. But it turns out his Dad just passed, his wife is cheating on him, and if this new show doesn\u2019t get picked up they might lose the house they just bought. EVERYONE has their share of crap they have to deal with, give or take, no matter how easy it looks from the outside. Life isn\u2019t about what happens to you, it\u2019s about how you deal with what happens to you. Figure out a way to make the most of what\u2019s going on\u201d. For some reason, knowing that EVERYONE\u2019s life sucks to some degree, was immensely helpful in getting me back on my feet.\n\nThe other was a year or two later, when I started tuning vocals for Rob Cavallo. One of his wrecking crew of session musicians had been in a band with a huge hero of mine, who had sadly took his own life mid way through making his second record. I asked the guy if there was anything he could tell me about working with said hero, and he said \u201che was the best musician I\u2019ve ever met. Whatever instrument you played he was better at it than you were within 10 minutes of picking it up. But he seemed to think he was the only guy that ever got a raw deal from the music industry\u201d.",

    "content": "I like the idea of agency as practice. A really talented artist I've been working with recently is young and very new to the industry. They don't know much about being a recording artist, how publishing works, how the business side of things goes down, or what kind of a team they need to build around themselves etc. So I suggested some further reading, shared some of my experience and gave them some tips (as I always try to do with younger artists, to do what you say @spectrummasters and support them). Their response was 'Honestly my manager can do all of this for me, I just want to focus on the music, it's all too complicated and goes over my head'.\n\nSo what can you do \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nThis, I guess, is one example of someone who could really do with some personal agency. If their manager walks, they're a bit fucked. There are thousands of other young artists out there who will be actively educating themselves on the business, joining Discord groups like this for furthering their networks and education, and proactively looking at how the arc of their career can be navigated 'by them', not 'to them'. This kind of proactive attitude would immediately gift the artist I'm working with a leg-up, giving them an advantage over peers, with a higher chance of success. The more they do this, the more control they have over their career. It's a win-win.\n\nSo back to a more definition-based view of the term 'agency', or like I said before 'nous', a lot of folks could do with more of it and I totally see both sides of this conversation. It's good to explore the cultural and societal effects on something like this as nothing exists in a vacuum, but on a general, everyday level, it's SUPER useful and important to try and exercise control over outcomes. Is the opposite of agency apathy?",

I don\u2019t know where you land in regards to engineering vs the other aspects of music you may gravitate towards.\n\nHope this helps!",

I\u2019ve seen them four times before, and the sound was always top-notch, but last Saturday they played at some lame festival in Madrid with a 100 dB limit imposed by the city council that totally ruined the show for me. The crowd was almost louder than the band, and while you could hear the mix (more or less), it was impossible to feel it, even though I was in a good spot (centered and close to FOH).\n\n@chrissorem and anyone else who does live sound, I\u2019m curious \u2014 what\u2019s your take on SPL levels at rock/electronic gigs?\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d rather wear earplugs and still feel that punch in the gut than listen to NIN at 95 dB\u2026",

I would love some advice, and also, I', wondering if there's something I am missing about gain staging or signal flow - is it as simple as just plugging in all the I/O?",

Does anyone else experience a kind of uncertainty/mild anxiety about their work that might derive from the fact that you're not really specialized in a certain area? I feel like I'm not always as excited or confident about getting into a certain task not only because I know i'm not very good at it yet (which i know is all relative, I could still be exactly what someone else needs for something), but also because I know others are out there, sometimes in my personal circle, who are much better? For a little added detail, my fulltime career is as a voice actor, but I love mixing, and sometimes I produce some baby artists, engineer ADR and video game/commercial voiceover. This week i was asked to dialog edit an animated film, I have to comp vocals for someone's song, and there's always a litany of othere stuff, none of which I ever feel prepared to do so the work usually takes longer than I know it should. Maybe the answer is simply to stop trying to be everything to everyone, but honestly I'm terrified to put all my eggs into the voiceover basket even though it's what I've got the most momentum with.",

It seems like streaming is about as easy as it\u2019s going to get, and I don\u2019t really hear any Spotify users with qualms about their experience.\n\nI do wonder if artists will become less partial to Spotify over time though. It seems like there are so many different metrics of success now (Spotify streams, instagram followers, tik tok followers are the main ones I think of) that aren\u2019t always mutually inclusive of each other. And I wonder if that takes a little weight off of streaming numbers being the only metric that legitimizes an artist. And I hear people like Ryan Tedder talk about the importance of \u201cworld building\u201d for artists now - I wonder if fans of artists will care more about being part of that artist\u2019s ecosystem than the artist\u2019s music being a part of their music library. I think of how K Pop bands sell crazy numbers of physical copies as an example. They can still stream the music but it seems like there are more variables now.\n\nThinking out loud a little bit, I might have just said absolutely nothing with a lot of words lol.",
