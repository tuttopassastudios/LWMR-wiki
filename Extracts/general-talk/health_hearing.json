    "content": "Today I got a reminder of how important love and care are in what we do. Just wanna give a shoutout to @Nomograph Mastering for all the wisdom shared here on that topic.\n\nLong story short \u2014 I agreed to mix a track for an American rapper who had already been turned down by some A-list mixers, even though the guy had a decent budget. The reason was kinda obvious: he\u2019s got a personality that leans toward OCD, with everything that comes with that \u2014 defensive tone in convos, super long mix notes, and weird stuff like thinking a file sounds different just because it was renamed. (I forgot to label one file as \u201cref. limited\u201d like the previous versions, and even though it was literally the exact same file, he swore the \u201cnon-limited\u201d one had a different top end.)\n\nStuff like that made me seriously consider walking away from the project like the others did \u2014 I could just feel the back-and-forth drama coming. But after my first instinct, I remembered a lot of what\u2019s been talked about here: love, care, and being open to the music and the art. So I decided to try empathy instead of just being a jerk out of frustration.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. After taking a bit of time to really talk to him and show I genuinely wanted to help \u2014 not just as a mixer, but as a human \u2014 I learned he\u2019s totally burnt out and running on fumes 'cause he just became a dad. And I totally get that, since my first kid was born a month ago too. That connection shifted the whole vibe. The next round of notes actually made sense, and we ended up approving the first mix by version 4 \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad at all. Happy client, job done.\n\nNot saying you should hang onto toxic clients, but it was a solid reminder: don\u2019t always go with your first reaction. Sometimes just showing a little care  about the person on the other side can change everything. It did for me this time. And tbh, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve handled it this way if I hadn\u2019t read some of the stuff shared here. So thanks, y\u2019all. This place is gold.",

I crushed it on a deadline, then that same A&R hired me a year later to work on a band called Emblem 3 who was on X Factor US as well. I crushed that and then six months after that he recommended me to a UK A&R who was having trouble finishing a song for One Direction. I did a spec production on the song Best Song Ever and they liked it and used it and all of a sudden I become a big pop producer. Stemming from doing an great job on some instrumental cover for a dumb singing tv show.",

    "content": "Ok Long Post alert, but touches on a few things we harp on around here. \n\nSo my little bro is in town- we made dinner for one of his oldest friends who just moved to town with his wife. He\u2019s a fantastic mandolin player and his wife is a singer/songwriter. \n\nOf course I did the ol\u2019 studio walk through, listening to all the tunes on the ear calibration playlist, then let them play some of their own favs. Of course they\u2019re blown away and have never heard music like this etc. \n\nBut to drive the point home I show them a song @Rollmottle and I turned around in just over 24 hours. \u201cThe reason for the speakers & treatment etc is so we can make decisions quickly blah blah blah.\u201d  I pull up the session and we listen through and they\u2019re loving it- but I\u2019m noticing it doesn\u2019t have the 3D thing that all the other music we\u2019ve been listening to has. \n\nThen I show them the mastered version. An mp3. It\u2019s louder and better sounding and all, until the first BGV stack hits\u2026 then it\u2019s IMMERSIVE. We listened to the whole thing again just to enjoy the magic and notice all the ways the master improved it. So far beyond zapping resonances and making it loud, @Rollmottle made it sound\u2026 important. Made *me* sound like a good mixer. \n\nIt was heavier lifting for him cause I didn\u2019t have the benefit of time for fresh ears or to detail the vocal the way I normally would. Also had the good fortune of having @Ross Fortune on speed dial and on GMT to give it a listen at 5am PST. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re curious, or dubious, I\u2019ll DM files so you can hear what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nTL;DR: monitoring matters, fresh perspective matters. Don\u2019t produce mix *and* master your own shit.",

I was initially on the fence, but am very glad I went. \n\nJon & Teezio were amazing together. I don't know how often MWTM does workshops with two engineers, but it really enriched the experience for me. It was actually comical how different their perspectives were on mixing, the business side, motivation for the work, lifestyle, etc... This created fascinating debate / conversation in the group. The Grammy nominations were announced while we were all together and we got to celebrate Jon & Teezio as a group for their I think combined 6 or 7 nominations. They brought in a bucket of champaign. All this after having gone through the sessions for said grammy nominated work earlier in the week. 10 / 10.\n\nRue Boyer studios is actually insane. Probably the best room I've been in.\n\nThere were attendees from all over the world. We ended up sharing mixes and receiving feedback from J&T. Hearing and sharing records in the same room with the people who made them with context provided from varying countries, cultures, genres, and scenes was as enlightening a music listening experience as I'm likely to have for the rest of my life.\n\nSo if anyone else here is on the fence in the future. Here's a tiny nudge.",

Although, I'll usually try and listening to mastering returns in Airpods or the car first to get a feel for how it sounds in the real world before geeking out in the studio. When I'm producing & mixing something, I'm often working on it over a longer stretch of time and find real value in listening to something in Airpods while on an airplane or driving around. Given how tuned in we can be as record-makers, I'm always amazed at how valuable passive listening is. I'm usually finding broad stroke adjustments that I can make down the road that really serve the project well.",

We need finer criteria to specify which version we're seeking.

The stakes for errors have gone up - when they are manufacturing 100k copies of vinyl then you have to be sure it\u2019s error free\n\n**Do you reject artists if they approach you to \u201cMaster my album i\u2019ll pay you whatever you want\u201d if you think the level of their sound might not honour your history with all these artists**\n\nI don\u2019t reject *anyone* who can pay my rate.

There are very very occasionally mismatches where I\u2019ll say \u201chappy to do this but I think you\u2019d be better served by XYZ\u201d, an example being someone coming to me with EDM who wants really intense processing - another girl or guy steeped in that genre will serve them better\n\n**How does it feel having a connection to these artists?**\n\nIt feels really nice to be trusted with people\u2019s art, when someone like a St. Vincent says \u201cyeah, this is good\u201d it matters to me, she has great ears and taste so it feels good to hit a mark\n\nIt\u2019s also very special to hear these things come out of the speaker for the first time - I\u2019ll never forget hearing Nick Cave, or Taylor or Lana in the room for the first time. It\u2019s a privilege to be trusted with their art\n\n**but does it ever happen that you are wanting more?\u201d**\n\nI\u2019m human and can be reliably trusted to do all the silly human things like being greedy, insecure, fearful etc. but every year I get a little better at living a better way, and around the music in particular my operating principles \u201cThe why\u201d feel better and truer than they ever have",

Right up there with investing in the right mattress.\n\nConsidering that our ears are the conduit for so much that is valuable to us, it is of the utmost importance to protect them. Why not make protection as attractive and easy as possible? A quality pair not only protect, but they are comfortable, and therefore something that we are more likely to wear when we have to.\n\nHit up an audiologist to have impressions made of your ears. You can reuse the molds for the rest of your life when you need new ones.",

I really try to fill in the context around the record by identifying all collaborators, timelines, interviews they gave around that time, published works, etc. I've got a huge appetite for that thing.\n\nI really love reading books written by producers. The more old school the better. Phil Ramone's *Making Records* is a great one. That guy is a class act. Quincy Jones has both an autobiography *and* a book specifically on producing. The latter is a great no-shortcuts look at what it takes to be great.

The speakers were his giant UREI 813c's on top of these custom subs... very heavy... and only sitting on cinder blocks. He was deep down a Fuzzmeasure rabbit hole and we were just moving, shooting, moving, shooting, moving back, shooting, etc, etc. When we'd finally make a change to the speaker position that seemed listenable, that was always the first song he would play to hear the speakers, followed by Back in Black.

I get overwhelmed very easily, so I find that this is often needed. BUT, if you\u2019re gonna go armadillo, then you wanna really commit to it until you feel a bit calmer and collected. Which leads to the next point \n\n2) sometimes I lie to myself that I\u2019m taking a break but do a few spurts of work because I feel useless not doing work. I\u2019ve learned that this needs to be avoided or else the \u201cbreak\u201d will be extended into a longer period of time, and I\u2019d be doing little work here and there but also not get anything done properly. It takes a bit of commitment to take a proper break, and in order  to be able to commit to it - recognizing it as a part of maintenance routine to stay well functioning is really important in my experience. I am pretty bad at pacing myself and managing my own mental and physical wellness, so I am working towards being able to put the brake on early enough so that I don\u2019t crash or skid away into a crash \ud83d\ude02\n\n3) to deal with that feeling of feeling useless, I found that doing things that I wanted to do can help once I have gotten calmer by being in armadillo state for a bit. Getting straight back to work from here for me is extremely difficult, so I start with the combination of taking care of chores that got backed up from busy life and doing what I desire outside of work life. Could be trying a new restaurant, picking up a new hobby or getting back to the hobby that gone on hold due to work life",

I\u2019ve taught many people everything I know about melodyne and they come out with a WILDLY different result than I do.\n\nHaving said that, pro tip 1: get your key commands for note choice, separate, stretch, formant, and vibrato mapped out to the buttons on your trackball, or in my case now, a row of buttons under your left hand on your keyboard. Makes a HUGE difference in not just your speed,  but also how intuitively you tune once switching tools becomes easy and reflexive.",

This has generally been the key to many of the opportunities I\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s an English word for it, \u201cnous\u201d, which I think is similar to agency but also encompasses the notion of having \u201cgood sense\u201d.

One of things that frustrates me to no end is the belief that there's a \"How to\" checklist for how to get good. The answer is there is no answer and it looks different for everybody. I can certainly tell you the principles and strategies for how you might get good. But you need to find your own way and do the work. And sometimes that is quite literally grinding until you break through. People don't like hearing that there really is no answer (and they think you're being a dick for telling them there isn't one...which is a whole other thing). I think the ubiquitous accessibility of information has trained a generation to expect answers to be a Google or one weird trick away.",

Maybe I need to live with them for longer and get used to it.\n\nLast week was the first time that I was able to sit in front of an Atmos setup that was meant for music (aka: not in a movie theater) and really get the full musical experience. In fact, I got to sit in front of *three* different Atmos rigs in three different (treated) rooms that evening and two of them were undoubtedly set up as good as they could have possibly been (One was a PMC showroom and the other built and tuned with their input). While the speakers themselves were impressive and very capable, the actual experience felt pretty disjointed. There was a pronounced feeling of phasi-ness that I didn't like.\n\nIt was great hearing these records on a rig that probably cost $250k, but my big takeaway was that they felt disjointed and odd. Even when sitting in the sweet spot.\n\nPerhaps my opinion will change with more exposure, but I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the time and effort. I will add, though, that half the mixes we heard were up-mixed from old stereo recordings with minimal track counts and only two of them were modern productions.",

Recording took us 7 days and they still needed to add synths and bass fot some of the songs after that (side note: the production wasn't finished by the time we tracked, so I edited everything I had - 10 songs, none of them with less than 5 minutes. It was the band's first time in the studio, also, and had to edit lots of drums and bass stuff). After doing a first pass, I sent them the multitracks they asked for, to track the rest of their stuff with their producer (a colleague of mine). The next 8 months were spent waiting on their files to start mixing (this was supposed to last 1/2 months, max). When I finally got the files, you have no ideia how messy the project turned out (track names, bounce mistakes, ultrapocessed tracks with artifacts - even the ones we've tracked at the studio before, audible edit points,... all you can imagine going wrong at this point), so it took me a bunch of time to organize everything in a way that I could work with what I've got (going back and forth asking the producer for some files that didn't even get to me or asking if there was the possibility to get some of the tracks dry, without processing or fx - keep this in mind).\n\nNeedless to say, when I was ready to start mixing, I was already overwhelmed and tired of it, and I knew I still had a long way to go...\n\nFirst version took me probably too long to get right (2 months, approx., working on other projects that got scheduled on those 8 months) and I've sent it before I went on a few days vacation.",

Mine is more focused on how I want to hear (or rather deeply understand how I'm hearing) every day as close to consistent as possible, given we are human of course.\n\nMy 2 cents (which of course is just my experience): \n\nSome sort of routine before you work. Mine is that I wake up almost exactly at the same time every day, will work out at similar times (if possible), literally eat the same thing basically every day before during the work day, coffee at similar times, have  the same routine when I sit down to start work. Not all of that is possible or useful for everyone, but I think we can all find something that would focus us in a way that's useful and ablet to be put into practice for us.\n\nTruly I find it helps a lot. We are physical beings, how our systems and bodies interact can definitely matter, especially in our ability to be available to the music.\n\nThat said, sometimes things happen and you gotta go. You will be tired, stressed, whatever. You have to do excellent work under those conditions too, it might be the most important skill if we are being honest about making a career of this. So training specifically for when you feel rough is definitely something I personally find important.  Which is where physically training helps, it's a way to force yourself into (fake) adversity and train response\n\n@Slow Hand I know you know all this, just my experience",

    "content": "Setting an achievable long term exercise goal and making a plan on how you'll get there is a major key for getting into and keeping you exercising. And doing stuff that isn't boring too.\nI've always found doing a little often is way more valuable than doing 1 really intense workout here and there. (this is relevant for progression in any kind of physical activity too, and progression matters because its what will keep you interested long term)\nEating well and sleeping enough is also a major key. I know this is really simple stuff but If you make a habit of these things and stay consistent, you'll notice drastic improvements in physical and mental health, and you won't ever feel like exercise is a chore.\n\nIf there's one topic that I actually know a lot about, even down to a deep scientific level, it'd be this sorta stuff, so feel free to hmu with any qs whenever lol",

    "content": "Currently going back and finding/prepping/printing mixes for mastering for a passion project i've worked on-and-off for over 8 years. Some are just printed WAVs from a long distant version of Pro Tools with plugins that don't exist. Luckily I had the foresight to print versions without my obscenely loud 2013 master chain. Some of more recent PT sessions open right up and play back perfectly. The real question is how much to fuck with them before sending them off. When is enough, enough? I've rocked some these mixes around town in my car for almost a decade. It almost feels wrong to mess with the mixes, but there's just so much that can be improved upon. Makes me realize how much of the work we do is emotional and not just technical. Sure, I could improve the low end on a mix, modernize it... but is it worth it?",

As somebody's who's been at this crossroads (mixing & mastering vs. one or the other), I realized that to do one or the other the way I wanted to and do it right, I'd have to commit to one. And each of those paths imply different studio set ups and ergonomics and mindsets. I had 2 paths, you have 3. That\u2019s a lot to ask of 1 space IMO. I don\u2019t know how I could pull all of those disciplines off in the same space without feeling like I\u2019m making a compromise somewhere. Tracking and mixing seem most compatible from a \"one space\" perspective. I bet focusing on tracking and mixing will be a relief and pay dividends for you. Your knowledge having done mastering before will be an asset to you in the tracking and mixing phase and make your end product even better.",

(Assuming, you can already hum a melody on the spot and are not tone deaf) \n\nI wouldnt worry too much about theory and super correct technique. \n\nThe best Way to get anywhere on an instrument is by Playing it, and doing in consistently. Set some realistic goals and just get going, vocabulary and technique Will come naturally if you just keep Playing. \n\nFuck Playing scales and inversions and all that for now. \nJust go learn a metric ton of songs and melodies and learn to play them together. Do it by Ear. It Will be tough in the beginning, but you Will get very decent quickly if you just do the most important Thing, which is being consistent.\n\nI would reccomend setting a low minimum to do everyday to keep a realistic goal that you can keep, rather than a higher on you miss every now and then. You can always add more practice but it sucks to miss out on it.\n\nStart with song you want to Sound like and then you can slowly branch out when the style become second Nature for you. \n\nSadly there are no tricks or hacks or whatever youtube wants you to beleive to get their clicks. Its all about muscle memory and developing your ears together. And not to Sound like 4 bar loop, but consistency, and do it a lot. I cannot stress that enough. \u2764\ufe0f",

My job is about realizing someone else's vision and pushing that to be the best it can be. If you're being hired as a producer, then like me, you have to believe that you're being hired for your taste and perspective. So the question is, why doesn't it feel good to you? Is there something undiscovered that could make it better?\n\nI've written a lot of music that's outside of my aesthetic or personal tastes. But if I'm on the project, I'm going to be 100% invested in helping make that thing what it needs to be. There's a way into music that's outside of your vibe - sometimes it's getting excited about new techniques, sometimes it's exploring a genre you're unfamiliar with, and sometimes it's just because the people you're making music with are a good hang. Sometimes, the role of a composer (or producer) is to take their vision and find the version of it that **does **get you excited. We've probably all had that experience of \"I really never listen to X, but this one song/artist is just undeniable.\" So strive for that.",

    "content": "@Jeremy Klein some thoughts on home ownership... my wife and I have done pretty well on our house. We've got a large one for our kids (3 kids, my dad also lived with us when we moved into our current house, so 6 people total) and we do plan to downsize if / when they move out. Current rate is 2.65 (I got a good deal, and spent a little to buy the rate down at the time - payoff on that was like 7 years).\n\nWe kept the old house, and for about 6 months I considered renting it out. I did not enjoy being a landlord, though, and abandoned mission quickly on that. I'd definitely go the prop manager route if I was to even attempt it. Portland rental scene ain't great though.\n\nPrices in Portland specifically... if you chart them out, the more expensive houses aren't doing great, some zip codes aren't doing great, but in general anything in that \"starter home\" range that's also near a decent school has done pretty well.\n\nIn terms of investing in S&P 500 or total market or whatever, I think you can pretty easily see that they're more correlated than not these days. That was the big thing about the housing crash - RE crashed along with the market crash. In the past those could be decorrelated, so \"diversification\" worked in your favor. Housing crashing? Rebalance into stocks. Stocks crashing? Rebalance into RE or REITs. Truthfully, though, that's just not the case anymore. Nothing is safe \ud83d\ude42\n\nI think there's also some psychology here. You can run the numbers, and they do pencil out at times in favor of renting (and I do intend to rent at some point in the future, though I've mostly owned a house). However, being a bit \"house poor\" sure is a good way to do some forced saving. For years my wife and I paid an extra $1k a month toward our house, and had a very low rate, and we really saw our net value go up quickly. It was nice.\n\nOne final thought... you often make money on RE when you buy, not when you sell. Place I'm in (which is in a nice part of Portland up on the Alameda ridge) wasn't selling, and I offered $80k under list, and got it. Put $80k into it in improvements (had an ugly small kitchen) and it's worth a lot more now.\n\nOverall tho? I'm mixed. Bad neighbors suck and you feel stuck with them. Maintenance is a killer (3% a year is about right IME). Sometimes you just don't want to deal with problems. But then... renting sucks too in other ways. Choose your poison! \ud83d\ude42",

The overuse inflames the tendon which causes it to rub which causes it to get inflamed which causes it to rub which\u2026 the steroid shots, some rest, and a lot of ibuprofen over the next few weeks helped.",

You said everyone's optimal version or depth of engagement will be different. I like what the OG poster said above about taking time to get to know the artist on a human level. The first 30 mins or hour of a session. I'll just talk about life, stories, and passions. Anything other than the specific music we're there to write. I find this time allows everyone time to acclimate to each other. This time gives me a sense of their personality and how to best assist them to give the best performace they can. And with returning artists time to figure what mood they're in. And how to best direct that. And always ready to adapt my approach as I learn the artist and the song on a deeper level.",

If you had a perfect reflective surface that reflected back at a 180-deg angle into the null of the mic, that might be the case. But thats very rarely what happens in the real world. The cardioid pattern is shaped like a kidney and does stretch beyond the x-axis of the diaphragm, ultimately picking up lots of reflections from behind the plane of the capsule. Put a condenser microphone on a floor tom, under a cymbal and you'll hear what I mean. Or try singing into the backside of one. It sounds awful. Often, its the shittiest of the phasey reflections that get in through the back, so it's definitely worth treating. To your point, still lots of value in making sure behind the singer is treated as well as those reflections will likely be much more broadband. But given the size of this space (it small), I'd use all the help I could get in there.",

The platforms opening up to everybody is why someone like myself or my clients can upload any kind of music. \n\nI mention all of this to say\u2026 I think that\u2019s what they wanted.

They feel completely different.\n\nIt's hard to make something so elementary as that beat stand out as *the* version when it's been done thousands of times and saturated the greater body of music. Even though they're practically the same pattern. It's too common to be distinct at this point.\n\nI think what makes the *Billie Jean* beat distinct comes down to Bruce Swedien's impeccable sonics, our association with the (great) record, and the fact that Ndugu Chancler has that beat positively nailed to the floor with how stiff and authoritative it is. The pattern itself is still as basic as it gets but the execution elevates it.",

That life is to be respected and only changed with respect and in context with absolutely everything else that plays within the same section of the track.\n- There\u2019s no method for this stage, as it\u2019s more of a flow state of decision making that revolves around self trust.\n- Sometimes, the gut will give me that painful realization that the snare is still wrong. It\u2019ll be a process of juggling EQs, messing with routers, and questioning if I\u2019m meant to do this lol, but I make sure more than ever that I back up the previous version of the track and push through no matter how I feel.\n- For the sake of the tracks life that I should respect more than my desire to finish, I face this intimidating hurdle from a thoughtless place, letting go of any thoughts regarding the approaching finish line, commercial viability, etc etc. Literally any thoughts other than that self trust to know when to put it down, which developed as a macro skill across multiple projects for me.\n\n\nBut yeah - Also what @Juliette said \ud83d\ude02",

I'm doing 4 octave scale runs with both hands at various tempos to focus on consistency of fingering and of tone. The next frontier is doing a variation of these runs where one hand starts on a scale different interval (going up in 3rds, 4ths, etc...)\n\nThe exercise that's challenging me at the moment has been doing wide arpeggios (sometimes with intervals of a 7th or more) up and down a two octaves. I'm taking it slow and becoming more consistent, but I know I'm likely to start hitting a wall as I get them up to a quicker tempo, hence the renewed focus on really getting my technique right at these tempos.\n\nI've very much internalized the concept of \"Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.\" I'm starting things slow and not moving on until I can do them flawlessly at glacial tempos.\n\n@ehutton21 I think you're right about a teacher. LA is undoubtedly full of good ones. A lesson a week should help me to orient myself in the right direction.\n\nThank you for all of the insight.",

    "content": "So sound is captured as electrical signals by disturbing a magnetic field (or in the case of condenser mics, changing the voltage potential across a specially tuned capacitor), which generates an AC voltage corresponding to the compressions and rarefactions in the air. This is a whole topic on its own but tl;dr for dynamics you're moving a magnet back and forth inside a coil of wire, with ribbons you're moving the wire back and forth inside a magnetic field, guitar and bass pickup you're disturbing a magnetic field with vibrating ferromagnetic strings... anyway. \n\nLinear voltage amplifiers (ie class A, and AB for us audio guys) - which we use for mic preamps, line amps, differential amps, power amps, pretty much anything you can think of - work by using an AC voltage to vary DC current flow. In its most basic form, it works like this: That AC signal from the mic or guitar pickup hits either the grid of a vacuum tube or the gate of a FET, and changes the amount of current that flows from one end to the other (usually cathode to plate in a tube, and usually source to drain in FETs). Stick a resistor between the DC power supply rail and the amplifying element and you get a voltage variance because of ohm's law - current goes down, voltage goes up, and vice versa. So, you end up with a bigger version of the input signal, with its polarity inverted. \n\nDistortion is a *way* more complex topic and not one I'm equipped to explain, as I don't understand it very well myself.",

We can go outside and listen to a band in a room and hear reflections all around us. But there is a chance to go deeper with spatial audio, to create something hyper-real, as much of record making has always been. Every new technology has the opportunity to enhance or detract from our experiences, and we have to meet them where they are. Maybe Atmos ain't it, but as someone who spends a lot of time in surround.. there is a feeling to immersing yourself in sound that isn't going to come from two speakers.

Instead of explaining, it\u2019s better to do it and show it.\n\nMy humble take: our job is not necessarily doing what we\u2019re told. it is to take their vision, and take it to a place where they could say \u201cwow- I didn\u2019t know this is what I wanted but this is what I want now\u201d. Which I think is the taste and perspective factor. \n\nIt is case by case of course and some artists could come in with A to Z manual of what they want, which can be cool- or not. I personally find those boring, unless I really admire their vision and it just feel like an honor to be a part of it. I think being a yes man can be a quick way to become dispensable. But someone who is willing to serve by giving you some friction that can turn into some heat \ud83d\udd25 can be someone they find trustworthy and interesting. It\u2019s case by case dependent, some people need perfect aerodynamics to accelerate their vision, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily being a yes man- but rather about just being the right fit for the project and being someone who is fully on board to do what they are asking. \n\nBut I think more importantly- it\u2019s okay to miss. If they don\u2019t like it - then scrap it or give it another go. And it\u2019s also fine if you end up not being the one for the project",

The home increased in value quite a bit over that time (more than the historical average) - selling for $110k more than we bought it for. Wow! Huge return on investment right?\n\nAfter the dust has settled and we ran the numbers\u2026.it was a break even with renting. \n\nIf we would have taken that down payment and put it into VOO, we would have come out ahead and spent a lot less blood, sweat and tears. \n\nUltimately, I personally view rent versus own a primarily a lifestyle choice. Owning a home has benefits (and drawbacks) beyond the pure numbers, as does renting\u2026and all of that has to be a part of the equation.",

Making the players play again and again while waiting for the right confluence of feel to come together before moving on. There's so much care for the moment. That pace is antithetical to the way things are often done today. Understandably so.\n\nOf course, Dann also expresses the feelings of doubt that anyone would go through in his position; wondering what it was about him that wasn't good enough for the take. So I think it's good that Mutt was up-front with the players about how they were going to approach it, which could allow the players to stop thinking about their abilities and sink into the right headspace for such a long endeavor as Mutt explored.",

To piggyback off what @peterlabberton said, when I mix, I rarely need to be a tiebreaker. Most of those situations get decided by delivering a mix update with two options. Just do the teeny bit of extra work and give them options, and they'll usually decide amongst themselves.",

    "content": "Anyway: uncompressed PCM audio (.wav and .aiff) is made up of digital words generally 16 or 24 bits long recorded however many times a second for a given sample rate, for fixed point (integer) values. Each bit represents ~6dB of dynamic range. Every time you go up in level 6dB from that particular sample point, another bit flips from 0 (off) to 1 (on). The least significant bit defines your noise floor, so 16 bit audio has 96dB of dynamic range at maximum from noise floor to full scale (every bit turned on). Seems simple enough, right? And it isn't super complicated. But it has one problem: you run out of dynamic range real quick if you're changing levels with (virtual) faders at 24 bits. There are two ways around that:\n1, make the mixer engine run on a much higher integer word length (like old Pro Tools HD systems, which use 48 bit integer), and the mixer automatically converts the audio (if anything is done to it, including fader moves) to 48 bit. Think of this as adding more digits to the fractions side of a decimal point. \n2, make the mixer engine run on a floating point system (almost every other DAW, including more modern versions of Pro Tools) - that is, you move *where the decimal point is* . 32 bit float effectively works as 24 bits that can be moved around more or less with impunity, up or down.",

Not always the case, but it is sometimes for me, and if I knew more about why, I may be able to prevent it happening in the future.\n\nWhat you guys think? Anyone get a similar experience?",

I'm listening to this Baby Keem/Kendrick track right now and it's ruining it for me.\n\nI recently re-listened to 'Blacks Reconstruction' by The Roots and it's completely unlistenable now that it has a good 80 edits in it, despite being labeled as the \"Album Version\": https://open.spotify.com/track/6cq1D3ZaL8SrrHkgHB8nwl?si=6720c9125a9e40b8\n\nIt's not as if records like this ever stood a chance of pop appeal and required an edited version to reach an audience. It's so dense with profanity that it'll never be played in public anyway. Now because of this censorship not only does it fail at being acceptable to a broad audience it's also rendered unlistenable to it's intended mature audience.\n\nIf I didn't already love this record and didn't already own an uncensored copy I almost certainly would never give it a fair listen and come to appreciate it. I can't help but wonder if a lot of great music today is being rejected out of hand and not discovered by new listeners because of the censorship.",

Your hand floats and stays loose over the pad.\n\n2. Can be placed right beneath the keyboard (if you're not already using a laptop) and cuts *way* down on travel time for your mousing hand as it travels from keys to mouse and back. It's always in the same place, so you never lose a moment of focus searching for the mouse with your eyes or adjusting your grip once you grab it, which adds up.\n\nIf you want to get *really* fancy you can press keys *and* use a trackpad with one hand in certain instances.\n\n3. Multi-touch commands, bebe! (swipe, stretch, pinch, etc)\n\n4. Can be ambidextrous if necessary.",

I'd rather just pay once for a license, rather than be dependent on their subscription for the rest of my life (SaaS strikes again).\n\nI downloaded the (free) standard version to see if that'll do the trick and they want me to create a login account using FB/Google/email, etc. I bypassed that step and it turns out I can't even use the *Library view* feature without a user account. Perhaps this is because they also have fancy cloud sync and radio options, but that's way too elaborate for my needs. I just need a localized application that allows me to browse and play my files on my laptop.\n\n\ud83c\udfba*sad trombone*\n\nAnywho, it probably sounds like I'm moving the goalposts on you, but I really didn't think things would be this elaborate \ud83d\ude04.

Sometimes this is because it morphed - gig work (which I do just at a very large scale) can really suck the joy out of you. Here you are working, but you're also marketing, you're doing sales, you're chasing payment, you're reviewing contracts, you're \"presenting\" yourself to other people, you're worried about seasonality, you're thinking about healthcare and taxes and retirement, and you're doing it ALL YOURSELF. I don't work for a big company (I run a small one) but my wife does, and the nice thing here is: you just show up and do YOUR job, you're a nurse and you take care of folks, you're an accountant and you reconcile spreadsheets, etc. Instead we do EVERY job with zero economies of scale, and no matter how much you try to \"outsource\" it, that costs money, it costs oversight and time and initial effort, and in the end it's a lot.",

It feels more stilted that way.\n\nTo me it's like writing in cursive versus writing in print.

I haven't looked at Shopify's print on demand pricing, but in general POD is much higher cost than bulk screen printing t-shirts (for example). So if you're a band selling at the scale where $40/mo. on a slow month isn't your *entire* profit margin, it seems like investing in a run of merch would pay for itself.\n\nNow this is completely different if you look at it from the perspective of a clothing brand, where the goal is to have a diversity of designs available at all times, without the need for warehousing and a huge startup cost, and to consistently push sales to a customer base that's devoted to *the merch*. I can't imagine the vast majority of DistroKid artists are going that hard on ecommerce, but they could sure benefit from having their POD merch visible on their Spotify profile. The small artists I work with would probably be better off putting $40 into Instagram ads every month.",

Things that give certain people a head start on different crafts can probably be analyzed into different components. While \u201ceither you have it or you don\u2019t\u201d can lead to defeatist thinking, I believe seeing them as a make up of different components can really bring out individuals\u2019 best self. \n\nwe all have our fortes, but not everyone is able to break them down and integrate the different strengths to create synergy. And the \u201ctalented\u201d individuals are the ones who has integrated the different strengths, whether it was through deliberate discoveries or something that was given to them circumstantially. I believe rephrasing \u2018innate talent\u2019 to something like \u2018natural qualities/traits\u2019 can lead to more freedom and more useful perspective than \u201cI could never be like X\u201d - because of course you can\u2019t, you are not X. \n\nWhich brings back to what you were saying about the value of  journey over the prize",

I\u2019ve pissed away a lot of opportunities because I don\u2019t love the music. That felt like integrity when I was young, but in my 40s feels\u2026 more childish? \n\nI think finding things we don\u2019t like in the way others do their business is an exercise in ego. Saying \u201cI\u2019d never do that\u201d is less helpful than \u201cI wonder why they do that.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent your life building a template, and that template works at a very high level for high level clients, it makes sense you\u2019d trust that.

If you don't want to be chronically online/focus more on music making you don't have to set a super interactive precedent. But there's real power in really engaging if that comes easy for you.\n\nWhen I was doing daily youtube videos and really engaged with fans we would easily sell out big batches of merch etc. Friends with bigger numbers per video, especially if they interacted less & showed less of their personalities, had much lower conversion rates even if it might look more impressive from the outside. As often comes up in this server, it can pay to go for quality over quantity of fans, especially in the long run. But again, if you establish an interaction rate that works for you, it should be possible to make it work. You may want to consider how to connect fans to each other more instead & build a community, to the extent you can with what you're putting out",

To become the most whole version of themselves, imho. \n\nYour job as a producer is to create a safe and encouraging space where they can explore and express it, say scary things, move forward in their ideas. It\u2019s also your job to then facilitate the process at every stage, musically and otherwise, to make sure the execution is as good as it can possibly be.

Sometimes we're in the studio with very specific goals in mind. For example: to sound like the the musical equivalent of the artist's Pinterest board, to sound like two of the artist's favorite artists had a baby together, to sound like the last album but different, or just to make our own version of an already-established style of music. On the other hand, sometimes we're searching and digging and discovering to see what happens. In these production sessions it may seem like there are no goal posts -- the goal is there but it's just not readily apparent. Maybe the artist doesn't seem like they even know what they want but they do and they'll know it when they hear it. And then once (if) you get to that aha! moment, it's like hitting something hard when digging for treasure in the sand. Maybe it's just a rock, or maybe it's coprolite or maybe, just maybe it's a chest full of gold coins which you can then hand over to the labels, managers, lawyers and streaming services while you keep a couple of the remaining fragments of copper for yourself.",

    "content": "I like the idea of agency as practice. A really talented artist I've been working with recently is young and very new to the industry. They don't know much about being a recording artist, how publishing works, how the business side of things goes down, or what kind of a team they need to build around themselves etc. So I suggested some further reading, shared some of my experience and gave them some tips (as I always try to do with younger artists, to do what you say @spectrummasters and support them). Their response was 'Honestly my manager can do all of this for me, I just want to focus on the music, it's all too complicated and goes over my head'.\n\nSo what can you do \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nThis, I guess, is one example of someone who could really do with some personal agency. If their manager walks, they're a bit fucked. There are thousands of other young artists out there who will be actively educating themselves on the business, joining Discord groups like this for furthering their networks and education, and proactively looking at how the arc of their career can be navigated 'by them', not 'to them'. This kind of proactive attitude would immediately gift the artist I'm working with a leg-up, giving them an advantage over peers, with a higher chance of success. The more they do this, the more control they have over their career. It's a win-win.\n\nSo back to a more definition-based view of the term 'agency', or like I said before 'nous', a lot of folks could do with more of it and I totally see both sides of this conversation. It's good to explore the cultural and societal effects on something like this as nothing exists in a vacuum, but on a general, everyday level, it's SUPER useful and important to try and exercise control over outcomes. Is the opposite of agency apathy?",

I\u2019ve had many wins, but going a long period without financial wins has made me question the judgement I have when navigating everything.\n\n\u201cWinning\u201d to me is a culmination of things that can be summed up as living authentically while positively contributing to the world and lives of others. It helps fight of the tendrils of negativity I feel coming from so many angles of the outside world, especially in the last decade.\n\nI don\u2019t exactly know what I\u2019m asking. Or want. I\u2019m looking to process these feelings and synthesize them into a new level of awareness as I move forward with what I\u2019ve learned being integrated into my subconscious.\n\nSometimes being around others, or hearing their experiences and takes, helps me get angles of things in a way that I can piece together for a rough draft of what will become the lesson that I carry with me moving forward, regarding this topic at this time.",

Can we cancel working with the mastering engineer?\u201c\n\nI ended up having a talk with him and he came around wanting to use the \u201ehuman\u201c master instead after listening a couple more times and indeed noticing some improvements over the AI one. I also explained to him the benefit of included revisions included in the rate for the master.\n\nSome of this comes down to him being a bit more inexperienced, though I still found the casualness in the way he suggested using the AI one and simply ditching the human engineer a bit shocking and also quite frankly scary\n\nI wonder if this an isolated incident or something I\u2018ll have to discuss with younger Artists in the future time and time again\n\n(Just to be clear, I didn\u2018t even say that it\u2018s a downright must to use the human version if he prefers the AI one. I just made it clear to him that the human engineer still has to be paid regardless) \n\ndid you guys have a similar experience lately?
