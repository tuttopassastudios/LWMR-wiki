Which speakers? How should I treat my room? What limiter etc? If I were to answer each one individually it would \n\nA) Be a huge time suck\nB) Deny everyone else that response if it was useful (including future members searching the archive)\nC) Deny other contributors of the ability to build on that info, co-sign or even disagree so we can make our ideas better \n\nThe working pros here give their time so they can have the maximum impact for younger players, asking for custom one off responses to your specific issue on a private channel undermines that\n\nThanks!",

    "content": "Today I got a reminder of how important love and care are in what we do. Just wanna give a shoutout to @Nomograph Mastering for all the wisdom shared here on that topic.\n\nLong story short \u2014 I agreed to mix a track for an American rapper who had already been turned down by some A-list mixers, even though the guy had a decent budget. The reason was kinda obvious: he\u2019s got a personality that leans toward OCD, with everything that comes with that \u2014 defensive tone in convos, super long mix notes, and weird stuff like thinking a file sounds different just because it was renamed. (I forgot to label one file as \u201cref. limited\u201d like the previous versions, and even though it was literally the exact same file, he swore the \u201cnon-limited\u201d one had a different top end.)\n\nStuff like that made me seriously consider walking away from the project like the others did \u2014 I could just feel the back-and-forth drama coming. But after my first instinct, I remembered a lot of what\u2019s been talked about here: love, care, and being open to the music and the art. So I decided to try empathy instead of just being a jerk out of frustration.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. After taking a bit of time to really talk to him and show I genuinely wanted to help \u2014 not just as a mixer, but as a human \u2014 I learned he\u2019s totally burnt out and running on fumes 'cause he just became a dad. And I totally get that, since my first kid was born a month ago too. That connection shifted the whole vibe. The next round of notes actually made sense, and we ended up approving the first mix by version 4 \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad at all. Happy client, job done.\n\nNot saying you should hang onto toxic clients, but it was a solid reminder: don\u2019t always go with your first reaction. Sometimes just showing a little care  about the person on the other side can change everything. It did for me this time. And tbh, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve handled it this way if I hadn\u2019t read some of the stuff shared here. So thanks, y\u2019all. This place is gold.",

    "content": "...completely unrelated to anything  but on my mind this morning\n\nSomething I've said here (maybe too) often is that approaching the work in a loving way is a real unlock. Love being a quaity of a attention, a way of meeting things. It might not be obvious but it can start small and grow out embracing many more aspects of what we do\n\nI mastered an album a few months back for a phenomenal indie artist, @Rob Domos and I both absolutely loved the music and the overall experience. The artist's team came back this week with a last minute request to remaster what was probably my favorite track with an added feature from a legacy artist. It's kind of mind bending how much better it is\n\nRob and I spent some time yesterday just appreciating that someone (the artist, manager, A&R?) actually thought up the idea of this feature and made it happen. I was so content with what it was but someone somewhere was like *\"you know what would be sick ...\"* and made it real. And now the world gets to receive something beyond what we could have imagined, something we didn't even know we needed\n\nJust focussing our attention on that for 2 mins in the hall yesterday made the day better and put some gas in the tank. There are so many challenges in what we do, it really helps to take time to focus attention on the jewels strewn everywhere too. They are not always immediately obvious",

    "content": "Ok Long Post alert, but touches on a few things we harp on around here. \n\nSo my little bro is in town- we made dinner for one of his oldest friends who just moved to town with his wife. He\u2019s a fantastic mandolin player and his wife is a singer/songwriter. \n\nOf course I did the ol\u2019 studio walk through, listening to all the tunes on the ear calibration playlist, then let them play some of their own favs. Of course they\u2019re blown away and have never heard music like this etc. \n\nBut to drive the point home I show them a song @Rollmottle and I turned around in just over 24 hours. \u201cThe reason for the speakers & treatment etc is so we can make decisions quickly blah blah blah.\u201d  I pull up the session and we listen through and they\u2019re loving it- but I\u2019m noticing it doesn\u2019t have the 3D thing that all the other music we\u2019ve been listening to has. \n\nThen I show them the mastered version. An mp3. It\u2019s louder and better sounding and all, until the first BGV stack hits\u2026 then it\u2019s IMMERSIVE. We listened to the whole thing again just to enjoy the magic and notice all the ways the master improved it. So far beyond zapping resonances and making it loud, @Rollmottle made it sound\u2026 important. Made *me* sound like a good mixer. \n\nIt was heavier lifting for him cause I didn\u2019t have the benefit of time for fresh ears or to detail the vocal the way I normally would. Also had the good fortune of having @Ross Fortune on speed dial and on GMT to give it a listen at 5am PST. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re curious, or dubious, I\u2019ll DM files so you can hear what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nTL;DR: monitoring matters, fresh perspective matters. Don\u2019t produce mix *and* master your own shit.",

On to mastering now. Today feels like the first day of my life \ud83d\ude06\n\nAll of this to say what I think is really important and some things I learned that I wish I knew when I was in the middle of those project blues:\n1) you WILL get through it.\n2) it might be possible to turn it down or pass it to another person\n3) trust yourself and your skills to make the best you can\n4) set boundaries and expectations. From the start. With the artist and yourself.\n5) try to find something you can enjoy during the process - to me, it was on the very last day of mixing that I changed something on my workflow that got me excited, helped me get to the sound of the album we were looking for and will probably be something I will do for every project from now on\n6) surround yourself from colleagues/friends who can help you - I know this needs a strike of luck too, but I'm sure if you don't have a reliable in-person \"work friend\" who can be there for you (with kindness, while keeping it real), this discord might be a good place to ask for that kind of help.",

Although, I'll usually try and listening to mastering returns in Airpods or the car first to get a feel for how it sounds in the real world before geeking out in the studio. When I'm producing & mixing something, I'm often working on it over a longer stretch of time and find real value in listening to something in Airpods while on an airplane or driving around. Given how tuned in we can be as record-makers, I'm always amazed at how valuable passive listening is. I'm usually finding broad stroke adjustments that I can make down the road that really serve the project well.",

Classical music is an organizational nightmare right now on streaming services because classical music gets filed/classified way differently than pop music that has a single, definitive recording.\n\nIf I'm hunting for a recording of 'The Rite of Spring' there could be 40 different versions available to pick from. We need finer criteria to specify which version we're seeking. I need tools to search by the following: Piece name, movement, conductor, orchestra, year of recording, remastered/original, etc. The list goes on. Classical listeners need that level of granularity because the different recordings/interpretations are a big deal in the classical world.",

I would not describe that as \"a lot of the mastering processes happening in the mixing stage.\" For me, mastering is the process by which I 100% align the final product with the artistic intent. There's a technical component to that, but there's also a huge component of that that is pure vibe. Can I enhance the feeling of this song without getting in the way? Is the feeling of this song fully realized? Is the feeling of these songs together fully realized? Uncovering all that to me is the job. Sometimes it's already there and there's very little, if anything, to do. The perspective is still valuable. The key here is somebody who both understands the technical aspects of the job as well as somebody who can internalize and FEEL the music. The latter is why I believe mastering is one of the most misunderstood processes.",

This role is changing, and we'd all be smart to understand where it's headed.\n\nI get hired to finish songs a lot. Usually that means I have a \"co-producer\" credit. Sometimes it means \"mixer\" credit. Occasionally it's included \"mastering.\" But really what I'm hired for is that combination of experience and technical knowledge. I'm an outside ear who knows how to fix what's missing. This role of \"finisher\" is really where a lot of the producer/ mixer/ mastering engineer profession is headed. The distinction between those roles is getting blurrier. \n\nMixing engineers have moved from pulling up faders on the console and creating a mix (old school \"mixers\") to often just pulling up the rough mix of stems and making finishing touches (Jon, Manny, Serban, Tony, Bainz, etc.).\n\nIn this way, the \"mixing engineer\" profession is moving away from manipulating raw sounds to manipulating nearly finished mixes. This is sounding more and more like what a \"mastering engineer\" does. Now there's \"stem mixing\" and \"stem mastering\" too, further blurring the lines. These are all just slightly different configurations of the same thing. Who do you hire to get perspective and then act on it?\n\nThose of us that are finishers or mixers or mastering engineers or whatever would be smart to think about how to adapt to the direction this is all headed. \n\nI want us all to win. I think we need to step back and expand how we think about the roles. It's the best way for us all to have careers.",

I also notice a pretty common trend in here where something will be brought up, and two people will seem to be disagreeing with eachother while making the same points - I think this misinterpretation is just an inherent downside of short form convos over text (which also have their upsides) \n\nSo I was thinking, would anyone ever be down to hop on a face to face group discord call (pretty sure you can do that?) if not zoom call, where we just chat for an hour or so as friends in the industry about making music? Just for the fun of it. I actually got this idea from @masteredbyjack, we had a similar call a couple months ago and it was good fun to just chat.\n\nCould be something to do once a month, or once every two months, so it's not a huge commitment, and obviously wouldn't be obligitary to stick to it. Anyone down? Or have any bright ideas? Maybe give a \ud83d\udc4d reaction and a thread could be made?",

Keep your head up while running down the court, you might see open lanes you weren\u2019t expecting.",

Into the coaxial cable that runs into the center console, for that true old analog gold plated warmth. Turned the windows and volume all the way up, then as I prepared to hit play. I was blanketed with the all to familar tension. That very same feeling from when I was going to have to sit next to one of the two dudes on the middle school basketball team. Who took as their daily task, to pay homage to ancestral animal social structures, by drowning any nearby male counter part with sack taps, donkey punches, and nail whip flicks. You just preemptively flinch at the inevitable pain from their onslaught. I hit play on a mix that is -5.8 lufs at peak. No proverbial donkey punch to my thighs this time. The song didn't overload the speakers at any point. As I heard the mix in my studio. I heard it here. The things I loved about it. I loved it here. The things I was unsure about. I was equally unsure about them here. My eyes welled up a bit with fulfillment and gratitude. It took me longer and cost more than I could of ever imagined, when I started this journey. But I got here. No longer do I have to worry about translation of the mix. I can focus all my worry on the feeling and vibe of the performace. I'm willing to let my ego have this one, this mix punches with any modern mix on earth. On any system. (Sounds killer on the Meta Ray Bans. And those speakers are rutheless honest. Ive heard alot of overloaded low end mixes on em) And back to the gratitude. I wanted to thank this place. I couldn't have done it without yall. I'd still be in a pitch black room looking for a switch that felt like it was hidden on the ceiling. Now back to work! Have a great day yall!!",

A rep from Lauten then chimed after all that and said that there was in fact a limiter built into the mic\u2026 which they don\u2019t mention anywhere in the specs of the mic or any of the adverts. The mic could sound killer (the vid with Brad Wilk is awesome)\u2026 but engineers need to know what their tools are doing\u2026 and in this case, Lauten fucked the dog on that front.",

    "content": "Sonic consistency amongst songs on a record is one of those things that gets harder as you move further through the production processes. In an ideal world, you'd map out an aesthetic for a record in pre-production and make choices in recording & production to try and stay within those lines, whatever that means. A real world example I have is when I was doing the last Mini Mansions album, we locked onto a few H3000 patches that sort of defined how the drums and ambience would sound throughout the record. We obviously didn't use it on everything, but it helped thread the needle through a wildly diverse batch of songs. After that, having one person mix the whole album will undoubtedly help tie together a record that's been all over the map in production -- be it different styles or producers. As someone that often is tasked with doing this, I am always referencing other songs in the album to try and make sure things are sounding 'consistent'. By the time mastering comes, everything should sound 99% complete.",

When a snare backbeat transitions from the use of a snare to instead a rimshot......or a particular clap sample.....and that track blows up, the wave moves . If you a year later release a track with the old snare on the backbeat instead of the rim .....that\u2019s dated . The same goes for the other percussions, the bass sounds (eg 808 / Moog in intro/bridge combi ) .....and the patterns . So this is why In twelve months most of the productions these artists are dithering over , will be out of date. It\u2019s just silly imo. Music is moving so fast and is ultimately so disposable at the mo holding onto it like some sort of special Tolkien esque ring is really just a vanity. Personally I\u2019d venture this is also the essence of what makes pop music trends discernible . That\u2019s just my opinion tho with respect to these genres. My overall goal is to record and mix work like rumours. Smokey , earthy and nourishing . A bit like @popaganda.  s last work .\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Just to add one more angle to the mix: most of you have been referring to agency as some kind of positive trait that you either have or you don\u2019t have it \u2014 almost commodifying it. What if we think of agency, or the qualities of having agency no matter what term we use, as the norm? As in EVERYONE has it. And whether or not we are able to fulfill those qualities and/or desires is due to limiting factors, whether they are external forces (class system, institutional racism, gender discrimination, war, peer pressure, financial hardship, lack of resources, etc) or internal struggles (fear, self-doubt, depression, addiction, laziness, inner saboteur, etc) or any combination thereof. I know it\u2019s totally idealistic but maybe if we\u2019re able to think of everyone as being just as capable as the next -- instead of an \u201ceither-you-got-it-or-you-don\u2019t\u201d kind of way, especially in terms of \u201cagency\u201d which sounds like a corporate buzzword du jour -- then we\u2019d be able to focus on and address the aspects of our societal constructs and daily lives that restrict our opportunities to succeed/work/create/thrive/survive/exist.",

I've rocked some these mixes around town in my car for almost a decade. It almost feels wrong to mess with the mixes, but there's just so much that can be improved upon.

And each of those paths imply different studio set ups and ergonomics and mindsets. I had 2 paths, you have 3. That\u2019s a lot to ask of 1 space IMO. I don\u2019t know how I could pull all of those disciplines off in the same space without feeling like I\u2019m making a compromise somewhere. Tracking and mixing seem most compatible from a \"one space\" perspective. I bet focusing on tracking and mixing will be a relief and pay dividends for you. Your knowledge having done mastering before will be an asset to you in the tracking and mixing phase and make your end product even better.",

    "content": "And sorry to bang on about this, but something that is critical to the audio quality on a record that is way out of most pro-audio people\u2019s view is the state of the cutting lathe being used to do the master cut. Many people working in audio have never even seen such a machine. They are complicated - there are techs who work on consoles who won\u2019t touch cutting lathes. IMO the best lathes were made by Neumann in the 70s/early 80s, and that was a long time ago. You have a TON of electronics and mechanics that need to be refurbished / restored to get the lathe to make some great cuts. Some engineers are cutting on some nicely restored systems and some are using some OLD stuff which should have been pulled for maintenance decades ago. Imagine if 50% of the records today were mastered on 50 year old loudspeakers with blown drivers and mismatched crossovers. We might notice.",

There are certain rules you can go by, but if you're just starting out, I would forego metering and start wrapping your head around some reference tracks. If you're able, have another track (that you know translates well) that's in stylistic ballpark of the song you're working on play out of a separate set of inputs. If you can toggle between your mix and the reference on a monitor controller, this is the best. There's a plugin called Metric AB that you can put on your master buss that will help as well. Then set the level of your reference track to 0dBFS so it's playing back full volume, and try and work your mix up to that level of 'loudness'. You're not necessarily trying to ape the sonic characteristics of the reference, but it will help guide you in making decisions throughout the mix process that add to the overall sense of volume. This will be much more insightful than chasing a single LUFS value or having a bunch of analyzers.",

It's exciting initially, but diminishes in effectiveness over time if there is no contrast from moment to moment.\n\nIf you can use finer and finer gradations of meaning to make your point, then your words have more heft and more expression with which to make them. \n\nCheck it out:",

At times as a mixer I feel I have needed to become the 'producer by proxy'. As well I could imagine how a mastering eng might feel they need become the 'mixer by proxy'. This language arises for me the more aware I am of what a 'great vision for a song', 'great production', 'great mix' *could* be and what it actually is in front of me. As well as from preconceptions of what the record making roles are about. I'm trying to connect the idea of a producer being someone who uncovers or brings forth an artist's vision (i.e. *\"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free\" - Michelangelo*) and someone who sometimes needs to manifest the vision when it is lacking.",

I think when you're creating, you have a choice between leaning in to whatever that is and exploring it as much as you can - and forcing something to be what it's not. One feels like the truth to me, one doesn't.",

    "content": "I've been a software designer for almost 25 years and still do it. Been running a label, making/releasing music and doing mixing and mastering for that whole time as well. About 3 years ago it clicked that mastering is my thing and decided to spend the last few years dialing in my rig and room around mastering. The job has been able to subsidize what has turned into a parallel career. I have designs on having this be my full time gig at some point, but I'm taking it slow, honing my craft and building my client base and studio while the steady paycheck is there. It's nice to be able to do that without grinding to make ends meet. I realize that is a privileged position to be in so I am grateful. With COVID, I can also crank out masters while I WFH when there's downtime or I need a work break. Some weeks are harder than others from a workload standpoint, but mastering is part of my brain-therapy so I'm happy to take it all on.",

Also learning to not be so precious with every song has also helped a ton with writing and finishing more tracks",

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

The worst lectures (when I started) were just dense information with very little active element for the students. They had the info presented to them so that was learning, right? Of course, that was the wrong approach, and the more i\u2019ve just provided broad themes to the group - i.e. make the sounds in front of you \u201cangry, happy, distant, close\u201d or \u201cwe will record/mix/master an EP within the next few weeks\u201d the better the sessions go, and the more inquistive the students are to uncover the \u201clearning\u201d as they are doing.  I find making a fool of myself (\u201centertainment\u201d) helps with this as it\u2019s a useful tool to disarm the groups and build rapport. The more you can encourage students to learn from each other, and share the learning - prompted by me, the better the outcome is for everyone.",

He\u2019s currently discussing fractals and the nature of our perceptions as being at one order in a fractal , and that colours and sounds don\u2019t exist in the real world , I love this .This gets to the heart of the science and the magic of what we do as musicians and engineers imo . He describes colours and sounds  as oscillations, and perceived harmonics as synchronous oscillations in the brain  . One of the things I geek out on is as engineers  is we get to learn and play with psycho acoustics and physics between  our and other peoples perceptions. ( Buddhism teaches pretty much the same thing Bach is describing here , it describes these things s aggregates . ) . This attention to how we perceive sound is what struck me about you and spiders discussion on lwmr ruari . It\u2019s curious and inspiring imo that somewhere between the maths , the physics and the deception of our perception , we are all capable of communicating something we all seem to be able to share In , a connection in a vast array of unreal oscillations .",

To your point on here ruari, about spoiling the feel in pursuit of the sonics, Pink Floyds remastered stuff feels like a completely different vibe. Theres a real lesson happening for me here about ruining a mix by being too clever.... before i dive into mixing some bits ove got to do....in many moments the drums' scrappier sound (IMO) of Yachty's el seminole feel better than the floyd remastered stuff (particularly Wish You Were Here / The Wall) . Thankfully my fav floyd album (Animals ) has still got an unremastered version up but overall i think these remasters are making your point for you ruari",

    "content": "a number of years ago I consulted on a music tech curriculum for grades 10-12, these were some of the key points:\n\n- Teach the fundamentals, always in a practical way. E.g. \"Today we're going to record ourselves speaking\" - briefly introduce how a microphone works, what a preamp is, and then get them recording each other. Same with EQ, Compressor, Reverb, Delay, etc.\n\n- Use as many examples from current pop music as possible. Does someone in the class sing or rap? Have the students go through assembling a vocal chain with a compressor, EQ, etc. and record part of a song.\n\n- Don't get too far in the weeds where it's not necessary. High schoolers DO need to know why we have different sample rates and bit depths. They DON'T need to know about aliasing, oversampling, clocking, or dither algorithms.\n\n- Bring history in for context, but don't dwell on it. It's cool to know that we used to need a speaker in an echoey room or a giant metal plate to make a reverb, but focus on how and why they're using effects rather than where they came from",

The track pad has WAY more ways to chord and double/triple 2/3/4/5 finger tap/swipe to program oft used key commands. I\u2019m giving it a year or two to become intuitive.",

Considering I always start with lyrics, the goal is to use whatever style serves the song itself.  Last year, I was much more concerned with trying to fit my lyrics into a specific genre. The process was much more limiting, and I found that my music got better oncr I dropped that mindset.\n\nAll that said, my audience isn't developed yet. So it's a drastically different scenario. Nonetheless, this message shows me that you're doing a great job with him. It's hard to craft an authentic sound, so kudos for helping him with that goal!",

If you\u2019re just starting out, you probably don\u2019t need it. If you\u2019re looking for that last 5-10%, you probably do. Sometimes they don\u2019t need to do anything other than tell you it\u2019s done (which in my opinion is worth it) and sometimes they have to be more heavy handed. What they actually do (if they\u2019re good) will likely be different every time. It\u2019s about getting the song over the line, and whatever it takes to do that.\nYou can get plenty of great mastering engineers for 100 dollars or less.

The Question Is, Now that you\u2019ve worked with all these great artists, Taylor, Jack, Dominic, Lana, All these amazing legendary people, How do you approach your craft now, in terms of attention to detail. Do you reject artists if they approach you to \u201cMaster my album i\u2019ll pay you whatever you want\u201d if you think the level of their sound might not honour your history with all these artists. And, in general, how does it feel having a connection to these artists, i am sure you feel blessed to work with these amazing people, but does it ever happen that you feel like you are wanting more, at the end of the day, we all are humans right, we crave for more cuz thats embedded into our DNA. Congratulations for the new carpenter album. <33",

Guys like RW Smith make 10 watches a year, by hand, the quality is exquisite and they are EXPENSIVE. It scales up from there,  but I think there\u2019s someone in that lane that probably hits all the markers you want to. \n\nMastering is a necessity, but you can drive your moms Carolla or buy yourself a cybertruck etc\u2026\n\nYou can use your phone to tell time, but where is the joy or passion for the art?\n\nSeiko\u2019s Spring Drive comes to mind. Using technology to  improve the art of timekeeping rather just trying to perfect it. \n\nIdk there\u2019s obviously a breakdown in that watches are either good at telling time or not\u2026 but the how is fascinating to me.",

    "content": "Going to rep Tailscale here.\n\nBeen investing in some infrastructure and future planning over here. The problem I was trying to solve was making my working drive available to me for when I\u2019m away from my studio so I can continue to be responsive to clients at all times. \n\nTailscale allows you to create a secure, private VPN without having to have a networking PHD and compromising your network. Basically install the client on a device, 2-factor auth into the client and any other client you have installed on any device signed in with those same credentials are available to you as if you\u2019re on the same local network, even if you\u2019re on another network anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s an actual game changer.\n\nFor a variety of reasons including keeping my mastering rig lean and clean and because the rig is not always on because I don\u2019t want to run my HVAC 24/7, I sync a clone of my working drive from my mastering rig to a drive attached to an always-on Mac in my home network that has the Tailscale client authenticated. I\u2019ve got screen share enabled on that Mac and now from any other device, I can sign into it and grab whatever I need from that clone drive. You can install the client on virtually any device including NAS\u2019s and mobile phones so it opens up whole new avenues in how to think about availability of your data, traveling, 3rd party cloud vs. rolling your own, etc. Tons of possibilities. Really big fan. Love the future.\n\nhttps://tailscale.com/",

Like we came out of mono and into stereo and Jesus gains were made .!..for all the new clever software have we made those sorts of gains from it ? I think loudness techniques yes defo , but otherwise ? Hmmm .

Now the \"hardest\" rock drums are heavily augmented with samples because they otherwise can't compete in loudness with electronic music (see again: Skrillex, the rock guy who moved into electronic music for maximal sonic excitement).\n\nProb my favorite acoustic rock drums are on albums like Significant Other, Songs For The Deaf, Around the Fur, Audioslave, etc.\n\nTo me these drums **translate** the best. When you A/B against a Bring Me The Horizon record, they don't snap the same, but the room and depth I feels much heavier to me.",

Is there someone mastering right now who is just boldly NOT slamming a limiter and letting things breathe more?

Most of the records that I get to mix or produce I'm expected to deliver a finished product ready to release. However when a lot of things are at stake (label release) it's almost 100% sure that a mastering engineer will take care to finish the record, do some QC and especially keep a human touch to the art. Would a co-mixer be able to do that? possibly, depending on their skillset/experience.\n\nwith the use of AI and other systems the expense of hiring a mastering engineer is already fading away but only for projects that are less risky. Say, if you have a tape library of 500 symphonic recordings and need to submit it for streaming so a few folks can listen to it, labels will most likely get an automated system for that to make sure that the standard levels are ok and that it translates well. I'm sure there would be a hungry mastering engineer willing to get that done but the industry is past that era",

    "content": "Insight gives you A LOT of visual information that isn't really useful unless you know what you're looking for. I have two visual meters while I mix... a janky old Goldline RTA analyzer and a TC Electronics Clarity. The RTA is useful for quick visual cues of kick to snare balance, how subby something really is, or when I'm working out phase relationships between drum mics... I can quickly glance to help aid with decision making. It's not necessary for me to mix, but I've had it for 15 years and it helps me make certain technical decisions quicker. The Clarity is very useful for the loudness radar. I basically set a guide LUFS (in my case, I'm usually shooting for -9) and you get a great visual representation of where you're at over the course of the song. Its especially useful to avoid fader creep... where I might nail the dynamics and loudness in the earlier parts of the song, but might overlook the last chorus being significantly louder, and in some cases, more squashed than it needs to be. I'm also an LCR panning guy, and it has a 'balance-o-meter' feature that has a cool weighted algorithm for determining if your mix is leaning left or right.",

    "content": "An interesting side note re: the psychoacoustic HRTF binaural sound localization discussion from yesterday\u2019s live with @Nomograph Mastering :\n\nI can\u2019t find my source right now but if/when I do I will link it, anyways\u2026 A study was conducted wherein moulds were cast of several people\u2019s pinnae (outer ears), these were placed on dummy heads with microphones inside the \u2018ear canals\u2019 and recordings were made through each of sound coming from a variety of locations. Some of the subjects were audio professionals and some were lay people.\nWhen the subjects listened back to these recordings, there was significant variance in their ability to localize the sound sources. If I remember correctly, they were generally better at listening through their own pinnae than others were, and audio professionals were a bit better at sound localization in general, particularly in the traditional stereo field. However, the really interesting finding was that there were some pinnae that were universally better or worse. People actually had improved localization through someone else\u2019s pinnae than their own, implying that although we are adapted to our own pinnae, there are material differences that make some better than others for localization of sound.\nThis is all from memory of reading something a few months ago, so I apologize if there are details that aren\u2019t 100% accurate, but I assure you that the surprising bit is correct!\n\nHRTF-based binaural mixes are not exactly the same thing as dummy head recordings, but I wonder if, in the creation of the aforementioned \u201cballer individual HRTF\u2019s\u201d there might be a place for some optimization beyond the exact copying of an individual\u2019s unique acoustic properties.",

    "content": "@Deleted User  and @masteredbyjack ....thanks for your perspectives gents. I dont disagree with you that what you are both describing is true for where we are at currently and have been for some time. im trying (badly) to not promote my view as opposed to the views shared by the engineers in the discussion im referencing....but fwiw , in 2022 the global recording revenue i think was around 20 billion dollars. Thats a lot of dough. Im not a socialist....im not against the free market.......the discussion was centred around the growing leverage engineers have in the industry and whether that is being marketed effectively to increase the price of the skilled labour engineers provide. When i first started getting indie production deals i was adviesd in the music business, when it comes to discussing deals, everyone's friends...when it comes to paying on those deals......no-one's friends....its only business. I have found this to be true and have no objection to it.",

You would also have to be very specific about which harmonics you add back in so they don\u2019t stick out too much. \n\nThis is super interesting to me because the fundamental that is perceived isn\u2019t actually there!

I think the cutting edge stuff is what pushes society forward but you need to understand the *why* things were and are the way they are before you can actually begin moving things around. Kind of like coloring outside of the lines, one must first understand why the lines are there and what the lines represent. \n\n#2). I\u2019m a 0 here in the beginning and then branching out in the later. I think it\u2019s smart to become known for something and once you\u2019ve established yourself, then branch out. Personally, I burned myself out trying to be everything to everyone. Trying to solve EVERY problem for every company limited my knowledge to fix niche problems in business thus limiting my income potential. \n\n#3). I go 10 easy. Long term success breeds *predictable* easy wins. I love the quote \u201cit took me 10 years to become an overnight success\u201d. Practicing a shot, riff, sales pitch, etc for years in the long term makes short term wins more sustainable and accessible.",

    "content": "I loved the analysis, I had thoughts about a few points he mentioned. \n\n1. Paradox of climbing up to the highest level\nCould Michael Jordan have become Michael Jordan if it wasn\u2019t for the feeling of someone chasing behind him to become one of the greatest of all time? There is only one Michael Jordan, and can anyone else be that one and only without going through what he has put himself through? \n\n2. Acceptance vs Dissatisfaction\nI think the dilemma here is between satisfaction and acceptance vs beating. I don\u2019t think one or the other is necessarily the answer, but I think a good place to be is finding acceptance in where I am right now while still beating on myself to keep on improving to the highest level I could be. \n\n3. Potential\nThis is a crazy concept to me. Who is anyone to evaluate someone\u2019s ceiling of improvement? Spider defined the meaning of \u2018potential\u2019 perfectly in my opinion. Not his exact works but; one\u2019s capable/willing range of adaptation. Did the professor in Whiplash really expand his students\u2019 potential in this sense? \n\n4. Abusive Internal voice \nI love how he saw the professor as our internal voice. And it made perfect sense to why I was so obsessed with this movie and the character. He was myself to me all along. I went back and forth over and over on whether this relationship was worth it to either of them. I think perhaps limited to this particular two people, because they had common goals/interests and made it happen. \n\n5. Joy?\nI feel that this is the most simple and complex out of all things here. Can anyone NOT experience any frustration while trying to get better at something? If the answer is no, is there a way to better manage the frustration? \n\nPursuit vs Result, our brain works the most consistently when we look towards pursuit. Result feels good but not for long, but what if the result meant more than just the goal being achieved? What if the \u201cresult\u201d portion leads to another pursuit after another?",

If I\u2019m \u201cmaking content\u201d and notice that I\u2019m doing so out of a place that is less than genuine, I will just delete and move on. \n\nFor me, the \u201cmix tips\u201d thing came out of a sincere place of excitement and passion. I would, as a growing mix engineer, stumble upon something that excited me, and I would find myself wanting to turn around to the people in the room to share\u2026well, there\u2019s almost never anyone in the room with me. So, I channeled that passion and excitement in a genuine way to share with the small community of mixers, mastering engineers and producers that I knew on IG. \n\nAt the beginning of my career on to the middle of my career, that became a very fruitful source of business for me - people who followed me on IG, who enjoyed my posts, and began to view me as someone who MIGHT know a thing or two about mixing. \n\nAs my career has developed and my clientele has growing, that has become less important, but it was absolutely pivotal in helping me build a deep bench of great clients, both indie and signed. \n\nBut\u2026I NEVER did it for that reason. It was always (and continues to be) a genuine result of my passion for what I do.",

Has huge sine bass notes in a few sections that were chattering a bit with the short iZotope maximizer release. This mixer uses the same limiter setting on every mix and I copy it and work from non limited mix, sometimes tweaking slightly\n\nSo bass distortion sounds cool to me, but more importantly it was in the REF. So to my mind it\u2019s cool and in the artist\u2019s signpost of intention \u2026. But they wanted it clean (which was possible and pretty easy)\n\nI guess the message and the reason for putting it in general is that we\u2019re all under the gun with deadlines, and all through the process there can be a sense of it\u2019s just a demo, just a producer ref,. just a mix ref \u2026. we\u2019ll nail it later.

I\u2019m interested if anyone here has a particular vision about how one can compensate for or say goodbye to that specific aspect of sound (the feel ) and how useful it is in record making . I think of drums and bass particularly in terms of the frequency ranges and how the transients feel on my ears / chest / belly etc for the different parts.

Ive had a couple of days with GNX now. \nWest Coast Gfunk/Death Row was the sound/feel that got me into hip-hop. w/ Snoop/DPG and Dre , and Brian Big Bass @ Bernie Grundman and all that good stuff.  They elevated hip-hop from the NYC sound imho to something different. In recent years Swimming Pools remains one of my fav West Coast mixes/masters, sooo, TLDR : If Kendrick was looking for a vessel to move on from such a massive LA legacy as Dre, TDE, Ali and M. Bozzi/Bernie Grundman imho he defo found it in you both.",

Vocals and guitar recorded over a 2track beat. I typically throw a Waves L2 on my master, just to bring up the level for the rough bounce, never doing much more than a dB or two of gain reduction. In this case I had the threshold of the L2 set at -3.4. The producer said try -3.5, then back to -3.4, then -3.5\u2026 flipping back and forth seeing what he liked more. I couldn\u2019t hear a difference. (I should say that we weren\u2019t in a well treated room, working on some mid sized genelecs. It\u2019s a  setup neither of us is super familiar with.) He decided -3.4 was better and I was in disbelief that he could even hear a difference. I asked if I could do a blind test to see if he could tell which setting was which. He closed his eyes and I switched back and forth a bunch of times before landing on a setting, and he called it correct three times in a row. He said he could hear something in the kick drum but couldn\u2019t explain more than that.\nI need a sanity check. I know my ears aren\u2019t hall of fame, but I\u2019m still in disbelief that he was able to tell a .1dB difference in volume on the limiter.",

Can we cancel working with the mastering engineer?\u201c\n\nI ended up having a talk with him and he came around wanting to use the \u201ehuman\u201c master instead after listening a couple more times and indeed noticing some improvements over the AI one. I also explained to him the benefit of included revisions included in the rate for the master.\n\nSome of this comes down to him being a bit more inexperienced, though I still found the casualness in the way he suggested using the AI one and simply ditching the human engineer a bit shocking and also quite frankly scary\n\nI wonder if this an isolated incident or something I\u2018ll have to discuss with younger Artists in the future time and time again\n\n(Just to be clear, I didn\u2018t even say that it\u2018s a downright must to use the human version if he prefers the AI one. I just made it clear to him that the human engineer still has to be paid regardless) \n\ndid you guys have a similar experience lately? How did you react?\n\n(If this is more appropriate for #\ud83c\udf9amastering-talk or #\ud83e\udd16ai-talk lmk)",
