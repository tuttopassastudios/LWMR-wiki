We\u2019ve done so many home DIY projects\u2026 I\u2019d be up late the night before planning, up early double checking. Staying afterward to make sure everything to put away and cleaned up. I care. Invaluable in building a home studio. I enjoy the results every day, even 5 years later I get a grin when I walk into that room.\n\nLearning to cook pizza? Figure out where you want be. I started doing this 2 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing. But I limited my variables, took things one step at a time. What kind of flour is best? Buy different ones. Try them. What hydration dough? Fuck if I know. Start with 60%\u2026 work up from there. How long to ferment? Etc Etc. I obsess over every step of this process. \n\nWhen I\u2019m interested in something, I care about it. Nobody else has to, but I do. And I\u2019ll go to bed at night, I\u2019ll know that I\u2019ve done the work to really know that it\u2019s as good as it can be.",

    "content": "It sounds like you're using their browser site to navigate your files, correct? I hate to say it but that's clunky as hell and you may as well be using Google Drive at that point (No!). Using Dropbox in-browser to navigate should be a last resort.\n\nThe move here is to connect Dropbox with your desktop so that your Dropbox folder appears and functions like any other folder in your Finder window. It will be far far easier to manage your files this way because they now have all of the same navigation functionality as your local files. \n\nI understand your desire not to download everything from your DB to your local drive. That's an easy thing to control once you wrap your head around how selective sync works. Once you get DB set up on your desktop you can specify that nothing should be downloaded to your local drive unless you specify (online-only), but you will still be able to see all of the cloud files inside of your DB folder in the Finder.\n\nIf you decide you want to download a file to your local drive you can right-click on the file and tell it to download (make available offline). And if later you decide to remove it from your local drive and make it cloud-only you can select \"make online only\". It's pretty simple once you get up to speed on the workflow.",

They moved from the city to central massachusetts and while the songs and mixes are about 80% done, they can't get above water time and travel wise to finish the project and its put on hold for next year. This is a big record for me as a producer and musician, and it sucks that I put so much time and effort into it but in the end, I hope waiting it out  and getting back to refocus in 2026 will be worth it. On the other hand, I get hired by a band, they are super intense and ambitious about recording, mixing, and releasing - the album comes out and they breakup in 3 months or theres a lineup change where the new drummer has a home studio and can record everything there and mix it then 6 months later I get a IG dm to bail them out becuase the drummer fucked the guitarists wife and the bass player and vocalist are just going to finish the record on their own with me.",

    "content": "On this note, I'll say that I LOVE these drives. My workflow in the past has basically been to buy a new 1GB SSD drive every few projects. When I had my setup on a laptop, this allowed me to always have access to projects I was working on the go (printing stems on the couch while watching TV? Yes please). In addition to using these SSDs, I'd always keep local backups with 'Sync Folders Pro' -- RIP Sync X -- on a cheaper, larger capacity USB drive. Being an anxious data archiver, I also signed up for Backblaze a few years ago as a cloud solution in case my studio burns down. Its a really great service, but the caveat they have with your drives is you *can* back up externals, they just need to be connected to your computer every 30 days. So I bought this monster USB3 hub and just had all of these fucking SSDs connected to my computer whenever it was setup at my studio. It worked fine for a few years, but I ran out of space again a few weeks ago and decided to futureproof mysetup a little bit. I ended up getting a thunderbolt Drobo. That way, I could have redundant storage for archived projects (which also gets uploaded to backblaze) but without having 16 drives on my desktop. Now I just have two of those samsung SSDs -- one work, and one as a backup. They run lightning fast and I get to keep having local backups in case I fuck the dog moving files around after a few glasses of wine. Then, when I run out of space, I just offload onto the Drobo and it's locally redundant, and also backed up on the cloud. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",

That alien sound came about because extremely loose muscles create far less sympathetic intermodulation which sounds cleaner. It\u2019s the same as how a speaker makes your desk vibrate and create out of time interference pattern distortions. Muscle tension creates hard surfaces that do the same when singing and opera singers obsess over undoing this. This is a big reason why so many of your favorite vocalists are opioid and benzo addicts. It\u2019s not just culture. Downers are performance enhancing here. (Please don\u2019t get any ideas artists) \n\nThe modern pop voice is just maintaining that exaggerated opera looseness but with adaptations for the modern medium: English diphthongs instead of Latin ones, way less air in their lungs because the target is a foot from their mouth instead of 50 feet, and softened fricatives because a capsule right in front of the mouth harshly exaggerates fricatives. \n\nFrom a physics perspective it\u2019s the perfectly optimized way to sing in 2024. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance sounds like",

The degree to which we build upon and leverage what we do have is our puzzle to solve.\n\nI\u2019ve had countless conversations with lost folks who think success and the things they say they want just happen. It is VERY difficult to teach self determination to people who don\u2019t inherently believe that taking direct action toward a goal makes things start to happen. A lot of people don't believe it can be that simple. This doesn't mean it's easy. It can be hard to overcome one\u2019s wiring and circumstances. And sometimes people need to learn the hard way. But, outside of the extreme, everybody\u2019s got the agency to make their desired outcomes happen. Some need to work at it harder than others. For some, it comes easier. And sadly some never realize that their outcomes are in their hands. But what a powerful realization it should be that the things we think we can\u2019t do are often just ourselves telling us we can\u2019t do them, when in fact we absolutely can.",

I was there for a week and it was palpable from the front-desk to the interns, assistants, musicians, engineer, everyone silently acknowledged their fortune to be working in such hallowed ground. It just made it really clear that every single person cared, and cared deeply. I'm sure not all studios in London are quite like that, but it's stuck with me.\n\nI've worked at all the scoring stages in town and many of the record studios and it's just different here. The closest I've come to experiencing that level of care and respect for the work being done was at Capital. This isn't a judgement about talent, but the demeanor. If an intern or assistant acts like they don't care or aren't as invested as everyone else in the room, it can bring down a session. Or at the very least, it starts to feel like they're in the way, not on your side. If an artist or engineer has mostly had that kind of experience, I can see defaulting to seeing the assistants as \"the help\" instead of an integral part of the team, deservedly so or not.",

It's 1/4 of the price of an OP-1, it's half the size of a Push, it's tightly integrated with Live, it's a standalone tool (if you desire), it's battery powered, and it's portable.\n\nThe biggest features for me are that it can fit on a desk without taking up massive real-estate and gives me the ability to play in drums, keys, *and* have 8 mappable encoders that are tightly synced with *Live*. For me it would replace drum pads, encoders, a tiny keyboard, and a *Launchpad* that would otherwise go on my desk. It's pretty damn elegant in that regard.",

I can always HDMI I figure if I need the extra real estate.\n\nThe only acustica plug I run regularly is Ruby 2 - seems to cause pretty drastic spikes on the CPU short term in Ableton (running rosetta mode and VST3 by the way) but then it levels out.  In general I've been super impressed with the performance vs my desktop.  I'd say for my mixes it runs maybe 80% as well on large projects (75+ tracks, lots of processing) which was more than I was expecting.  Smaller projects and productions and softsynths it absolutely chews through compared to my desktop.\n\nWas just trying out a little mix in Studio One just on the 14\" and it felt very cramped to me.  I think it'd be hard to completely mix at this resolution but again it probably has more to do with what I'm used to.  Would definitely recommend a separate display if you are going to be doing all your work on it.",

The more I do that the more I realize that the production and tracking are significantly more important than MIX/MSTR for the \u201csuccess of the song\u201d.\n\nI\u2019d love to put my hands on outboard mastering gear but I have a few upgrades that I would like to do for my tracking situation(full live band tracking) and the costs are about the same for either, I get a little less work tracking but it\u2019s like 40% Mastering 35% Tracking and 25% Mixing work.\n\nMost mixes I do all in the box and the little outboard I have helps shape the tracking upfront and doesn\u2019t get used in Mastering, but does get used sometimes in mixing.\n\nI operate out of my home studio which provides low overhead, my \u201cstudio\u201d is where my band rehearses and where I Mix and Master, I also bring bands in occasionally to track in my basement, but it a little tight.\n\nI wonder what y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts are, I love doing all these things but feel like, I\u2019m just kinda stuck treading water and not swimming toward a destination.",

I\u2019m trying to avoid having two copies of everything.  Big scope question so if you are willing to share your best practices please feel free to dm!",

We were very close to backing out of the process, until we saw the place we got, and the determining factor for us was that it had an ADU, and was in our budget. There\u2019s work (and money to sink into said work!) we need to do, but once we have a tenant in, even conservatively I think it will either cover our mortgage, or come close to it. (It\u2019s very likely NOT going to cover tax and insurance, but that\u2019s more than fine.) We also were in a really fantastic first time homeowners program, which allowed us to put only 2% down, and gave us a grant for another percentage point down. This is all helped IMMENSELY by my girlfriend both having a real deal grownup salaried job and having just about perfect credit. But it\u2019s going to allow us to build wealth through the house, and allow me to build my studio space, AND if we ever want to leave LA, because our interest rate is comparatively great, we\u2019d just keep it and rent both units.\n\nSo, TLDR, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a slam dunk always great idea, but I think if you can finagle the situation to work for you, it can be really smart.\n\nAlso, my entire family on my mom\u2019s side has been school teachers/librarians/pastors/professors (so doing fine but by no means rich), but my parents and their parents were both able to ride California real estate into a very comfortable place in retirement.",
