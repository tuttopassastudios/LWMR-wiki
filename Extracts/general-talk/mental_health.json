    "content": "Without going too therapist couch on the details, I was the only kid that had to lie to my parents in highschool and tell them I was going to parties (which were ok) and then went to work playing shows on the sunset strip (which was banned). Moving to Australia to join a band in my early 20s got me excommunicated from half of my family, some of whom I didn\u2019t get to talk to for nearly a decade. Some had credible experience in the industry, others just in life, but truthfully, if you care about someone\u2019s quality of life and ability to provide for themselves and hopefully a family, you don\u2019t steer them towards a career in music. \n\nBut, I wouldn\u2019t be told no, and every time I was pushed away from something I wanted to do (I couldn\u2019t go to school in LA because it was too close to the industry) I ended up somewhere that actually furthered my career (I ended up in San Diego, where I became friends with the Switchfoot guys which really helped launch me). It\u2019s why I have such little patience for the \u201coh the studio manager was short with me while I was an assistant\u201d crowd\u2026 if you want it bad enough, you figure out a way to make it work. And if you don\u2019t want it bad enough, there\u2019s a hundred more guys like me that do, that are willing to sacrifice their time/health/money/etc to the cause. I don\u2019t say that to frame it as admirable or healthy or anything positive, it\u2019s just the truth of how things are. \n\nSo, that person that\u2019s going to quit because a studio manager was challenging, or a teacher didn\u2019t like their song? They\u2019re going to get devoured by the people that really dedicate their lives to this, and it feels cruel to tell them otherwise.",

I was initially on the fence, but am very glad I went. \n\nJon & Teezio were amazing together. I don't know how often MWTM does workshops with two engineers, but it really enriched the experience for me. It was actually comical how different their perspectives were on mixing, the business side, motivation for the work, lifestyle, etc... This created fascinating debate / conversation in the group. The Grammy nominations were announced while we were all together and we got to celebrate Jon & Teezio as a group for their I think combined 6 or 7 nominations. They brought in a bucket of champaign. All this after having gone through the sessions for said grammy nominated work earlier in the week. 10 / 10.\n\nRue Boyer studios is actually insane. Probably the best room I've been in.\n\nThere were attendees from all over the world. We ended up sharing mixes and receiving feedback from J&T. Hearing and sharing records in the same room with the people who made them with context provided from varying countries, cultures, genres, and scenes was as enlightening a music listening experience as I'm likely to have for the rest of my life.\n\nSo if anyone else here is on the fence in the future. Here's a tiny nudge.",

    "content": "sort of related, but i've been reflecting a lot on how precious it is to maintain a listener's perspective on a work in progress, and what things we can be doing as the producer/mixer/etc to grant that privilege to the artist first and foremost. the simple stuff includes saving the nitty gritty work for your own time, delivering the best mix of the record no matter the stage it's in, focusing any time spent together on how you can make their voice and contributions and ideas the best they can be. some artists love mixing and editing and getting into the weeds, but i'm realizing quite often how much of a duty it is to be the artist, and how record making is only a single slice of that pie. For us it is more or less the whole pie. and a big responsibility we carry (perhaps without realizing?) is that it is our job to protect the artist from getting  stressed out by the process. and this extends to processing and managing our own stress about the work should it exist, as stress is a contagious energy.",

    "content": "In the midst of a kinda unique side quest at the moment - label pulls me in at an hourly rate with an artist (and good friend) that I\u2019ve mixed for many times because the production sessions were such a mess that they felt like they couldn\u2019t even finish the records until some light mixing and organization took place. Songs spread out between multiple project files, DAWs, laptops\u2026vocals tracked to mp3s with the ~50ms delay thing\u2026Some of these producers templates\u2026brilliant stuff. Saw one vocal travel through maybe 7 or 8 auxes and hit probably 4 different rvox\u2019s along the way. It was like a labyrinth of signal flow that was nearly impossible to follow (and once I deleted half the auxes and waves plugins, it started to come back to life). In short they\u2019re having me un-mix it, hand it back for some more production, then do the final mixes later this year. A true testament to the importance of organization and more importantly minimalist, straight forward session files. I wonder how often this need comes up and how feasible it is to be involved ahead of the handoff as a mixer these days. And before you frown at me for griping, this is an absolutely incredible project, many insanely talented musicians I respect. Very right brained, free flowing group. So it felt cool to be able to play more of a part on the project as the more left brained participant and see the stress relief happen in real time.",

I do understand some people lack confidence and for me I\u2019ve become more confident with experience and success",

Pick out the right drums. Spend time tuning them. Put them in the right place in the room. Try different places in the room. Try different drums. Setup some microphones. Listen. Adjust. Move the microphones. Maybe change the drums. Maybe change the microphones. Maybe they don't sound good because the part isn\u2019t right? Maybe it's something else in the arrangement? Take it out. Try it. \n\nThis takes quite a bit of motivation to get this deep in the weeds. But the results? Well, they were always unquestionably great. Could it have been fine with less work? Maybe. But you\u2019d never know. And nobody is going to care about this record more than you are.",

    "content": "what are some things that you\u2019ve been wanting to do outside of work life? \n\nI feel like the idea of \u201cbreak\u201d can look and feel different to many people, and I think the key is to find what version of those variations give you the most peace of mind and self acceptance. \n\nPersonally, I have a few tendencies and mindsets around break that self-sabotages. things I listed below help me fight the self-sabotaging\n\n1) going armadillo- when in extreme overwhelming state, you gotta find a way to get out of that. I get overwhelmed very easily, so I find that this is often needed. BUT, if you\u2019re gonna go armadillo, then you wanna really commit to it until you feel a bit calmer and collected. Which leads to the next point \n\n2) sometimes I lie to myself that I\u2019m taking a break but do a few spurts of work because I feel useless not doing work. I\u2019ve learned that this needs to be avoided or else the \u201cbreak\u201d will be extended into a longer period of time, and I\u2019d be doing little work here and there but also not get anything done properly. It takes a bit of commitment to take a proper break, and in order  to be able to commit to it - recognizing it as a part of maintenance routine to stay well functioning is really important in my experience. I am pretty bad at pacing myself and managing my own mental and physical wellness, so I am working towards being able to put the brake on early enough so that I don\u2019t crash or skid away into a crash \ud83d\ude02\n\n3) to deal with that feeling of feeling useless, I found that doing things that I wanted to do can help once I have gotten calmer by being in armadillo state for a bit. Getting straight back to work from here for me is extremely difficult, so I start with the combination of taking care of chores that got backed up from busy life and doing what I desire outside of work life. Could be trying a new restaurant, picking up a new hobby or getting back to the hobby that gone on hold due to work life",

Nothing in the back of my mind lingering, letting myself down.. \n\nAdditionally I have let my self imposed work hours go, just freeing myself to be open to the art life as it comes, any hours of the day. Trying to bottle everything into a 9-5 was difficult for me.. why are artists calling me at 9pm? Well.. that's when they are off from their day job and can talk. I took that boundary away for myself and felt some self imposed frustration melt away. Grateful for the calls, emails, texts, DMs.. any hours. Bring it on. \n\nBoth of these changes have helped my attitude and optimism AND HOPE of a future in music and art.. Continuing this on into 2026.",

When I get busy and she gets mad, it\u2019s because, historically, my business and fun big opportunities have meant she was going to have a lot of domestic labor and an overwhelming amount of loneliness to deal with. So now when I have a busy time coming up, I meal prep beforehand, I clean the house beforehand, I acknowledge that it\u2019s hard for her, I express tons of gratitude, and I always plan to block out some dedicated alone time for us afterwards. Anything to show that I understand the concessions that she\u2019s making and make my own big efforts to foresee what that means from her and minimize the negative consequences it could have. Maybe even make it something we can both look forward to.

    "content": "I have to let you know my first experience with this. Been working on an album that I recorded one year ago. Recording took us 7 days and they still needed to add synths and bass fot some of the songs after that (side note: the production wasn't finished by the time we tracked, so I edited everything I had - 10 songs, none of them with less than 5 minutes. It was the band's first time in the studio, also, and had to edit lots of drums and bass stuff). After doing a first pass, I sent them the multitracks they asked for, to track the rest of their stuff with their producer (a colleague of mine). The next 8 months were spent waiting on their files to start mixing (this was supposed to last 1/2 months, max). When I finally got the files, you have no ideia how messy the project turned out (track names, bounce mistakes, ultrapocessed tracks with artifacts - even the ones we've tracked at the studio before, audible edit points,... all you can imagine going wrong at this point), so it took me a bunch of time to organize everything in a way that I could work with what I've got (going back and forth asking the producer for some files that didn't even get to me or asking if there was the possibility to get some of the tracks dry, without processing or fx - keep this in mind).\n\nNeedless to say, when I was ready to start mixing, I was already overwhelmed and tired of it, and I knew I still had a long way to go...\n\nFirst version took me probably too long to get right (2 months, approx., working on other projects that got scheduled on those 8 months) and I've sent it before I went on a few days vacation.",

I love to throw stuff out there, even if I don't believe it. I want to stress test it.\n\nI can certainly appreciate conversation as a tool for aligning people on a belief or course of action, but it's got me wondering about how many of us are playing completely different games when we're having a conversation, and what other games are there?

What if we think of agency, or the qualities of having agency no matter what term we use, as the norm? As in EVERYONE has it. And whether or not we are able to fulfill those qualities and/or desires is due to limiting factors, whether they are external forces (class system, institutional racism, gender discrimination, war, peer pressure, financial hardship, lack of resources, etc) or internal struggles (fear, self-doubt, depression, addiction, laziness, inner saboteur, etc) or any combination thereof.

Mine is more focused on how I want to hear (or rather deeply understand how I'm hearing) every day as close to consistent as possible, given we are human of course.\n\nMy 2 cents (which of course is just my experience): \n\nSome sort of routine before you work. Mine is that I wake up almost exactly at the same time every day, will work out at similar times (if possible), literally eat the same thing basically every day before during the work day, coffee at similar times, have  the same routine when I sit down to start work. Not all of that is possible or useful for everyone, but I think we can all find something that would focus us in a way that's useful and ablet to be put into practice for us.\n\nTruly I find it helps a lot. We are physical beings, how our systems and bodies interact can definitely matter, especially in our ability to be available to the music.\n\nThat said, sometimes things happen and you gotta go. You will be tired, stressed, whatever. You have to do excellent work under those conditions too, it might be the most important skill if we are being honest about making a career of this. So training specifically for when you feel rough is definitely something I personally find important.  Which is where physically training helps, it's a way to force yourself into (fake) adversity and train response\n\n@Slow Hand I know you know all this, just my experience",

    "content": "If the alternative is to back home, I\u2019ll try to offer some advice from personal experience. I moved to Richmond, VA for a year, got a job at a hotel doing audio visual. I quit my first commercial/post production gig doing ads full time. It was the worst but I was determined to keep working in music, and try to get integrated in the scene/studio world. It was a serious low for my mental health, the job was terrible, I was struggling and scraping by without any pay off. To make a long story short, I applied for a job back home at a big corporate company with a full time composition/post production gig, on a whim - I didn\u2019t think it would get me anywhere. 3 months later I got the job and went back home after a year. I was out of the music scene back home at this point, and it took another year of reconnecting and working hard on my craft with friends who were willing to let me record their bands for the price  of drums heads and guitar strings, and honestly, those two things combined with some luck put me in a very secure and creative place, now making records for bands again that are paying decently well to boot. I don\u2019t know how far you are in your career/journey, but I\u2019m barely anything and have been recording for 15 years. It took me 5 years out of school to get barely a living wage and working lots of different types of audio jobs while making records, to get to a comfortable place emotionally, creatively, and financially. I\u2019d bet almost anybody in this discord has a very similar story. It takes a long time and like others have said, there\u2019s no one way to get there. Just keep doing you and trying to work on things that you enjoy.",

About 3 years ago it clicked that mastering is my thing and decided to spend the last few years dialing in my rig and room around mastering. The job has been able to subsidize what has turned into a parallel career. I have designs on having this be my full time gig at some point, but I'm taking it slow, honing my craft and building my client base and studio while the steady paycheck is there. It's nice to be able to do that without grinding to make ends meet. I realize that is a privileged position to be in so I am grateful. With COVID, I can also crank out masters while I WFH when there's downtime or I need a work break. Some weeks are harder than others from a workload standpoint, but mastering is part of my brain-therapy so I'm happy to take it all on.",

Every remote gig is different and I realize this situation is a lot of luck and circumstance. Don\u2019t be discouraged to take another gig. I was able to pay off high interest cards and can comfortably afford gear when I want it. I was full time in the studio from age 14-31 no other job. It was a transition, but one I\u2019m glad I made. I\u2019m still working mixing full time as well. I do production if I\u2019m stoked on the project. I work with rock bands for context. Just do dope work try not to compare. Remember there are some people with mountains of gear and dope setups they own. much respect to that. Others have rich parents, high interest credit debt, or both. I told myself if I wasn\u2019t rolling in it with a Grammy at 30 I would stop which is a super dumb mindset. I love making records more than anything and getting another gig allows me to keep doing it. Rant over best of luck to everyone \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd",

(Assuming, you can already hum a melody on the spot and are not tone deaf) \n\nI wouldnt worry too much about theory and super correct technique. \n\nThe best Way to get anywhere on an instrument is by Playing it, and doing in consistently. Set some realistic goals and just get going, vocabulary and technique Will come naturally if you just keep Playing. \n\nFuck Playing scales and inversions and all that for now. \nJust go learn a metric ton of songs and melodies and learn to play them together. Do it by Ear. It Will be tough in the beginning, but you Will get very decent quickly if you just do the most important Thing, which is being consistent.\n\nI would reccomend setting a low minimum to do everyday to keep a realistic goal that you can keep, rather than a higher on you miss every now and then. You can always add more practice but it sucks to miss out on it.\n\nStart with song you want to Sound like and then you can slowly branch out when the style become second Nature for you. \n\nSadly there are no tricks or hacks or whatever youtube wants you to beleive to get their clicks. Its all about muscle memory and developing your ears together. And not to Sound like 4 bar loop, but consistency, and do it a lot. I cannot stress that enough. \u2764\ufe0f",

To someone who doesn't work much with other people to whom success is largely predicated on their lone creative genius maybe the question of balance is neither here nor there.\n\nHowever, if you are on a team, are a leader, teacher, or coach suddenly you are on the hook with others and the performance of the group matters. The highest achievement, future funding, drawing in more talent, etc... might all come down to the performance of the group. Would it then be wise to be so laissez-faire about undermining the intrinsic motivation / confidence of others? What if an unintended consequence of that attitude is less actual human connection?\n\nLast thought I had is how do we know the truth of someone else's potential? Fwiw I don't know the answers but this is what's kicking around my head.",

I move slowly and make sure I understand before I move on. It may take two months to complete, but I'm steady with it and I do a little bit most days. It's common for me to transcribe notes from high-density talks that I want to learn from and revisit them often over the span of a week. I'm constantly printing out my notes and reading material so that they're easy to revisit throughout the week.\n\nI'm currently taking a project management course through MIT, which has been great. It's uncommon for me to do formal schooling these days, but this is work related and a direct application to my future capabilities that we thought would be beneficial for the company.\n\nWhen I buy a new plugin (rare) I set aside time to go through it and turn every knob and try each feature to see what it's capable of. Learning a tool on the spot is a good way to kill the creative flow, so I do the exploration up-front when possible.\n\nOften I'll have ideas for novel ways to use a tool (layering distortion, for example) and I'll set aside two hours to explore it and see what I find.\n\nThat said, I think my day-to-day may be quite different from a lot of folks here. My eggs aren't all in the business and pressures of record production, and so I rarely find myself buried in such commitments. I tend to keep \"normal\" business hours these days and keep a hard separation between my commitments and my leisure.\n\nIn fact I'd say that I'm actively structuring my life so that I can retain my leisure and don't find myself overwhelmed with commitments.

The first 30 mins or hour of a session. I'll just talk about life, stories, and passions. Anything other than the specific music we're there to write. I find this time allows everyone time to acclimate to each other. This time gives me a sense of their personality and how to best assist them to give the best performace they can. And with returning artists time to figure what mood they're in. And how to best direct that. And always ready to adapt my approach as I learn the artist and the song on a deeper level.",

I have not done lawn mowing but any one time gig with no schedule commitment can be a good option. The reason why I had to do this is because my day job wouldn\u2019t give me any more hours. \n\nMy issue lately has been the fact that I live in a very expensive city (Boston, MA), and I am barely making it work. More than 50% of the work I do heavily relies on being on-site (recording, live sound, and some parts of the production process).  If I moved further out from the city- the rent would not get cheaper enough to justify getting a car for the commute. And if I moved out of state to somewhere like Albany, NY or Rhode Island- I will be giving up huge part of my clientele and half of my income. So I thought a better option would be to get another day job that will help me stay where I\u2019m at right now.",

There is also a lot of pushing and pulling the artists to fit their expectations instead of serving the art and letting nature take its course. Specifically theres a lot of \"I can't wait to help you realize the full expression of your music and art when we work together!!!!!!!!\" kind of vibe which is great internally but puts off older artists a little bit. I've seen it a lot over the last couple years with young producers and engineers and I wonder if its because of the pandemic, honestly. The whole \"check list to success\" thing is another good point. Some things are not easily repeatable or scalable with the expectation of the same result every time.",

Notes, thoughts, ideas, receipts, photos, payroll, reminders, plans, parts, etc. Often I need to recall stuff that happened 8 months ago and that requires me to be meticulous in my organization.\n\nOn top of that, I'm ramping up into work with a second company that has the potential to draw on every single skill set and interest that I have. Having the tools to draw disparate connections between my past knowledge and the new ventures with this company could be a huge multiplier for what I can do. It's currently helping me to map out the idea space for this company and really get a big picture of everything that's going on.\n\nI'm a big believer that human memory is fallible and prone to unwitting revisions and mis-recollections that distort events. Even in ways that are benign. Every read is a write. So it's important to unload the important stuff in a place where it won't spoil and distort with time. You could say I'm big on long-term memory and a bit weak on short-term memory.\n\nI'm also a glutton for information, and offloading things and storing them \"externally\" allows me to unburden myself and not get overwhelmed by it all. I consider a lot of what I do to be trading in information and drawing connections.

    "content": "1st thing I'd recommend is listening to the Tape Notes podcast. they interview the artists and producers to break down the processes and stories behind the tracks. \n\nI got quite a bit of confidence in that respect from listening to those . especially ppl  that come back multiple times. I don't even necessarily listen to everyone's music, I'm often more intwrested in their personal approaches - especially since lost are folk who we'd consider \"established\"  and what I found to be true for most of them is they split into 2 main camps with most of us dancing between them. \n\na) have 0 clue wtf they're going for a lot of the time. kind of going with the flow of whatever is happening /they're feeling in the moment. very similarly to people starting out or me. the approach can vary wildly and a whole concept can be born of something seemingly unimportant at any given moment. \n\nb) there's an outline that comes to mind early and might give some direction. whether that's thematically or sonically. how tightly they stick to this can vary a lot depending on the artist. \n\nI think there are many factors that come into play - how good and ready the team they have is might be one of the most important imo. that's both for the creative side and admin side. \n\nas far answering  your questions as a producer, it depends. \nsome artist I work with will literally dream up the whole production and I'm kind of facilitating and bringing it into the real world. others will come with loose ideas and others will show up with absolutely nothing and go off the feeling in the moment. some are more involved than others in the production\n\nyour relationship with them is probably the biggest factor in knowing how far you can push their creatively bounderies. \nsame artist that dreams up their production usually gives me free range to try whatever I want when the session is over and I've overhauled whole songs.  recently a post-punk ish artist picked up a video game ost /jazz fusion prod I was sketching",

Easily the first half of my time in the bay was just constant anxiety about how I\u2019ll pay rent/will I work/blah blah. Then things got more solid and I could take my foot off the gas a bit. Was able to relax and feel confident I could make ends meet. Then I blew it all up and moved to LA to start over again! Ha. Not *really* start over again 100% since I had a lot more experience and a tiny bit of a track record, but I\u2019m only now beginning to feel that corner turning again, just a bit. I definitely feel that for me, those feelings correlate to how comfortable I am on, I guess you\u2019d say, the business side and how it\u2019s working out.

Has there been an in-depth discussion on live or in discord yet about musicians on tiktok? \n\nIt's a crazy scene of selling your creative soul for 1 minute of attempting to go viral. and then if you do get a popular video, whatever that one was - that is now your thing... singing into a trash can doing RHCP covers... ok, now do another 100 of those.  I see so much talent on there, genuine talent and artists who have worked hard on their craft getting 10 views due to the algo... once the algo has tried your vid on a few people and it didn't stick the vid is dead... so it's totally hit and miss based on your first small sample of viewers.\n\nI see this having a huge impact in many ways. On the plus - you are getting exposure to incredible new ideas, skills, trends, methods for being creative... on the negative it's demotivating to the nth degree, and cheapening the creative process, in my opinion.\n\nMatt and Jon recently talked about track lengths getting shorter and shorter, now 2 minutes is the normal. Partly due to the attention span of people... well what is this going to do... 1 minute pop tracks incoming? Just gimme the hook in 30 seconds and let's move on please. :p. How can we get young people to lay on the floor and listen to 10 minute vinyl tracks again? In my opinion humanity NEEDS this :)) \n\nI also swear I've heard the influence of trending memes from tiktok coming through in music in the charts, but cannot really back this up.\n\nWhat's everyone else's thoughts? I have a friend in LA who says everyone has gone crazy there for tiktok fame? \ud83d\ude1b",

That was indeed the most polished takes and performance they had, and it still needed A LOT of care), a list of reference tracks that wasn't even close in anything to what we had or could ever have, and me wanting not to jump in again on all of that. And during this, I had other people hearing my mix (colleagues) that were harsh on the way they gave feedback - not criticising, I knew it was shite, but I think it was the right thing at the wrong time for me.\n\nAt this point, I was struggling so bad with imposter syndrome, I was seriously considering quitting and getting the blues about the process, not happy with the result but not sure how I could do any better. And yes, I was working on other stuff, but this project was sucking all my energy and mood.\nFeeling like a fraud and a failure. There is no sugar coating it.\nBut most of all, I wanted to make it work for the band. I wanted to give them my best, and wanted really hard that my best could be the best for them. So I kept going, and entered into it. \n\nVersion 2... 7 pages of comments, all on different stuff that I thought we already nailed on the first version, since there was absolutely no comment on those things before... \n\nOh, by the way, by this time, I was still waiting on some dry tracks from the producer, to make moves that the band asked for on the first version review.",

    "content": "Speaking as someone who moved to the US, there are a lot of things that will make you miss Europe sorely. Mainly quality of life things, especially if you're moving to Texas (although ATX is not so bad)\n\nFirst, as people have mentioned, this country is massive. Everything is disproportionately large and far away. You will drive everywhere, which as a German you might not have an issue with, but it gets annoying when you want to pop over to the corner store to grab something and then you remember that doesn't exist, and then you're driving 30 minutes on the highway to the supermarket just to get two things. Normal errands will take you ridiculous amounts of time if you're not in a dense city, particularly east coast cities (NYC ftw)\n\nNext, there's the increasingly Kafkaesque nature of every commercial interaction in the US. People are generally not paid enough relative to their cost of living and are constantly stressed by student debt, credit card debt, auto debt, mortgage debt (if they're lucky enough), etc. As a result, those in many public-facing service jobs do not do their jobs very well. Sorting out a minor problem can easily involve hours of slogging through telephone menus and talking to service reps who can't really help you. An example is it recently took me over a month and 20+ calls to 4 different places to switch my health insurance, which is supposed to take a week at most through an internet portal (Healthcare.gov)",

So much stuff we have now actually makes us *less* happy and fulfilled, and so I always want to push back on the next new thing having had the hindsight of how these products have played out over the last two decades.

Why can\u2019t we spend our effort into exploring everything in between? \n\nDo everything in between come with labels or do they become lengthy sentences and paragraphs? \n\nI think the answer to all of this is complexity of life that us humans brought onto ourselves.

I believe both are true for both younger and older people *if they ended up giving up trying to dig deeper to explore and ponder on \u201ceverything in between\u201d*. I don\u2019t think age has anything to do with it.

Perhaps there's a more emotionally regulated way to view the long-term but I see risk, upside, downside.. If I'm not careful it can induce a lot of stress. I think I'd rather crank the slider closer to zero the older I get.",

If I\u2019m \u201cmaking content\u201d and notice that I\u2019m doing so out of a place that is less than genuine, I will just delete and move on. \n\nFor me, the \u201cmix tips\u201d thing came out of a sincere place of excitement and passion. I would, as a growing mix engineer, stumble upon something that excited me, and I would find myself wanting to turn around to the people in the room to share\u2026well, there\u2019s almost never anyone in the room with me. So, I channeled that passion and excitement in a genuine way to share with the small community of mixers, mastering engineers and producers that I knew on IG. \n\nAt the beginning of my career on to the middle of my career, that became a very fruitful source of business for me - people who followed me on IG, who enjoyed my posts, and began to view me as someone who MIGHT know a thing or two about mixing. \n\nAs my career has developed and my clientele has growing, that has become less important, but it was absolutely pivotal in helping me build a deep bench of great clients, both indie and signed. \n\nBut\u2026I NEVER did it for that reason. It was always (and continues to be) a genuine result of my passion for what I do.",

They may be credible, but since they don\u2019t recognize your potential, they\u2019re not coaches who will help you improve. Their disbelief quickly becomes your insecurity. It shatters your confidence and stifles your growth. That\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. But the research suggests that when they come from an uninformed audience, low expectations can become a self-negating prophecy. You\u2019re motivated to shatter their confidence that you won\u2019t succeed. Samir calls it the underdog effect.\" - Adam Grant, *Hidden Potential*\n\nAlso related are the concepts of the Pygmalion and the Golem effect in social psychology. Where low / high expectations for students / beginners can become self fulfilling prophecies. Begs the question how do you find the balance between being honest / truthful with folks just starting out without significantly undermining their intrinsic motivation and confidence?",

    "content": "Without telling the story about two years ago I had my first \u201cbad\u201d client. They were in the middle of building a house (unknown to me) and decided this would be a great time to manage that project but also make a record with me. Because I was under the impression that studios were financially out of reach for this person, I worked at half my usual rate and allowed them to give me a small deposit to start working together. MY MISTAKE.  Every time they came to the studio they were stressed out and unfocused. I did my best to make their home recordings sound great but there was very little good communication and it ended up that when I sent a mix over, I got a 8 paragraph dump about how nothing is working out, the mix was nothing they would ever release, then proceeded to call me a bunch of names - just taking out all their frustration on me. I zipped up all the work I had done so far and sent it over saying I think it\u2019s best if we went our separate ways, you can do what you like with what we\u2019ve done so far - I don\u2019t want any credits at all. Since then it\u2019s motivated me to make sure that I am following my process and OVERcommunicating every step of the way to be sure there\u2019s no confusion about the work I do with clients. I learned that this former client bad mouthed me to a few artists and I lost some work because of it. Eventually work got back to normal and it\u2019s been steady rocking ever since. The memory of how I felt motivated me everyday to be better than the day before, no joke - I know there\u2019s going to be bad days here and there but I\u2019ll be damned if I ever let someone take advantage of me like that again.",

I took some time to dig deeper into my uncomfort with this topic and I think it\u2019s really just about the concept of a \u201cpersonality trait\u201d. Maybe we can jam a little on it.\n\nI had this example in mind:\nLet\u2019s say we meet someone for the first time and while we\u2019re interacting I gather that this person seems like a \u201chappy person\u201d, they\u2019re smiling, giving off warm vibes and are kind. We keep on meeting this person and the experience repeats itself. So the more we meet, the more our idea that this person must be a \u201chappy person\u201d solidifies. We know of course that this is an abstraction and that the person is probably going to be sad, angry, etc. at times. \n\nNow let\u2019s say we think, man I really liked this person they are so easy to deal with, I enjoyed every bit of our interaction. I wish more people would be like that! And there you go. Now you are set to figure out all the details about happiness, the factors that make a \u201chappy person\u201d a \u201chappy person\u201d. The warmness, the kindness etc. and help people be more happy. \n\nNow you\u2019re really digging into it, you start making videos, writing blogs going out to teach happiness. People are really digging it and you feel like you\u2019re doing good for the world. So the concept is in everyone\u2019s mind happiness is what we should strive for and whoever is not happy enough yet just needs to try harder. Suddenly you\u2019re watching the news and you hear more and more people are getting symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety. And you think to yourself wow how did that happen? I thought I was making   the world a better place. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with a lot of these concepts that once they get institutionalized or gain popularity they somewhat lose their initial intent and can even have a rebounding effect. I mean we can see it going that way with a lot of different trends like mindfulness, health awareness, the work life balance etc.",

Every time I let go and allow myself to experience the present, it\u2019s a process of surrendering in itself.\n\nPerhaps like curling a dumbell, the more you let go in all those micromoments, the bigger the \u2018present\u2019 muscle in your brain strengthens.\n\nBig moments of surrender are a fantastic way of resetting into yourself, and the micro moments of surrender are how one prolongs that return to self, even when in the crashing waves of life as it ebbs and flows.\n\nThat\u2019s my experience^ So I\u2019d say - Trying to embrace surrender all together has been a must for me to get to a place to start really living life in the now.",

    "content": "For sure , I completely agree with you that weight should be given to the apparent findings of rigorous work . Absolutely. I also think it is a disservice to all of us if people are discouraged to approach unpopular ideas and ask questions about them for fear of mockery . Or that newcomers simply accept dogma of the day . That is anti science . Our greatest scientific discoveries usually shatter the pre existing concencus view (for the benefit of all ) Newtonian physics gives way to relativity, classic physics to quantum etc . \nAs you will know Cian , science is not about proving  things with absolute certainty it deals in probabilities . \nScience works to bring us to a place where we can say p< 0.05 . So imho we shouldn\u2019t loosely  present science as absolute and unchanging truths in service of quietening and/ or deriding people and/or their ideas . \nImho what is being missed in so doing is that it is those who dare to challenge dogma,  who challenge and constantly review empirical evidence that bring us the new discoveries . My point is less about discrediting null tests and more about celebrating people who dare to challenge dogma . And that science is also in support of those people . If young people / newcomers are to chase a few rabbit holes and cul de sacs for the will of exploration and finding things out for themselves , who would deny them that ? Those who probably did much the same thing themselves at the start of their journey into audio ? It certainly appears to be true that under observation and current technology the daws sum. Yet we are also at a moment in science where mathematicians are suggesting our reality may only be an avatar and time as a concept is outdated . In mind of these leading edges of scientific thought someone as clever as Jon challenging a consensus on nulling may or may not be genius . But laughing at or dismissing his and Aaron\u2019s and many others sense on it \u2026..doesn\u2019t serve any of us imho .",

Does anyone else experience a kind of uncertainty/mild anxiety about their work that might derive from the fact that you're not really specialized in a certain area? I feel like I'm not always as excited or confident about getting into a certain task not only because I know i'm not very good at it yet (which i know is all relative, I could still be exactly what someone else needs for something), but also because I know others are out there, sometimes in my personal circle, who are much better? For a little added detail, my fulltime career is as a voice actor, but I love mixing, and sometimes I produce some baby artists, engineer ADR and video game/commercial voiceover. This week i was asked to dialog edit an animated film, I have to comp vocals for someone's song, and there's always a litany of othere stuff, none of which I ever feel prepared to do so the work usually takes longer than I know it should. Maybe the answer is simply to stop trying to be everything to everyone, but honestly I'm terrified to put all my eggs into the voiceover basket even though it's what I've got the most momentum with.",
