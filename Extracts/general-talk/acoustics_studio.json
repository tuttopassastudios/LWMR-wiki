I also can't overstate how nice it is to be able to easily access extended credits AND ALSO not know how many times something has been streamed. I hadn't realized this as much in the years that I used Spotify, but as soon as I switched off of it, it became immediately apparent how much seeing the streaming metrics as the first thing had been shaping my impression of every artist or song I listened to before I even pressed play. I think the fact that Spotify hides most credits and highlights stream counts is a subtle but very real reflection of the way that the company has been turning music from an art into a commodity.",

It would give me tremendous sway over the music industry once everyone comes to recognize that I can't miss. I would leverage that influence to make some positive changes where I can. Set up some institutions to cultivate and nurture the next generation of artists. \n\nPresumably, while the hit music I\u2019m making runs counter to my personal tastes, it seems reasonable that it would still be valuable to *someone*. Just not to me. That will be my curse. I would dutifully churn out hits as fast as I am able to and gift humanity with a tsunami of unimpeachable pop awesomeness that will endure for a century. My sacrifice would be everyone else\u2019s gain.\n\nCounter-intuitively, by saturating the market with my personal brand of songwriting it would inspire the next generation of songwriters. Unable to compete with my torrent of sure-shot pop badness they would respond by writing new music that is the direct antithesis of my own brand of hits. With a little luck, the musical output of these writers would be exactly what I wished to hear all along.\n\nThat\u2019s a win/win right there. I just have to suffer a bit. I choose *Option #1*.",

After a few takes there'd be a pause while he waited for judgement from the control room. Eventually Dylan stepped out into the live room and got right up into the guy's face and said something really condescending to him about when to play. As Dylan turned away the guy describes having \"nothing but contempt for Dylan in that moment\" and he got super defiant and went into \"Fuck you, Dylan\" mode on the next take. Once the take was done he was left in silence to wonder. And as he squinted into the control room he could see everyone laughing their asses off. Apparently the whole think was a ruse by the control room to get a certain performance out of him.",

If you had a perfect reflective surface that reflected back at a 180-deg angle into the null of the mic, that might be the case. But thats very rarely what happens in the real world. The cardioid pattern is shaped like a kidney and does stretch beyond the x-axis of the diaphragm, ultimately picking up lots of reflections from behind the plane of the capsule. Put a condenser microphone on a floor tom, under a cymbal and you'll hear what I mean. Or try singing into the backside of one. It sounds awful. Often, its the shittiest of the phasey reflections that get in through the back, so it's definitely worth treating. To your point, still lots of value in making sure behind the singer is treated as well as those reflections will likely be much more broadband. But given the size of this space (it small), I'd use all the help I could get in there.",

I got super lucky with my boss who was also in the music thing and very understanding about calling out.

So far it\u2019s been working out and I\u2019ve been lucky to keep a good basis of projects, supplementing quiet periods with studio build stuff. It can be super stressful relying 100 percent on the music thing and it\u2019s ultimately different strokes for diff folks. I\u2019ve seen some people who get really burnt out taking music stuff that they don\u2019t like to pay the bills and conversely I\u2019ve seen people getting burnt out doing other stuff that\u2019s not music getting effected in the same way.

We can go outside and listen to a band in a room and hear reflections all around us. But there is a chance to go deeper with spatial audio, to create something hyper-real, as much of record making has always been. Every new technology has the opportunity to enhance or detract from our experiences, and we have to meet them where they are. Maybe Atmos ain't it, but as someone who spends a lot of time in surround.. there is a feeling to immersing yourself in sound that isn't going to come from two speakers. So yes.. mixing in Atmos can very much be a part of steering the ship.",

You'll likely get better sonic results if you can find a room with some more volume... that will also allow you to play with position in front of the microphone. As far as the level you should record at, if you've got any half-decent mic pre than you can go into the computer pretty conservatively. Assuming you don't have a super noisy chain, there'll be plenty of headroom in a 24 bit recording to bring it up after the fact. If you're looking for numbers, I'd shoot to get things into your DAW at around -18 dBFS. Many of the plugins modeled after analog gear tend to be happier with that level (or less if you're unsure).",

Unfortunately, my girlfriend is just about the loudest human on the planet when it comes to, for instance, coming home from work in the evening, or making dinner, etc.. When it\u2019s just me working alone (which is the majority of the time), I don\u2019t care and usually take a break when she gets home anyway. But, if I\u2019ve got clients over when she gets home, and they aren\u2019t good friends already, it\u2019s pretty awkward/borderline impossible to be cutting a vocal while it sounds like she\u2019s using a chainsaw upstairs to make dinner.\n\nAnyone have experience with replacing or soundproofing doors? The current door is flimsy and hollow-core, and my guess is replacing it with a solid wood door and sealing well around the edges will help a ton. (There\u2019s a healthy gap at the bottom currently.) Alternately, somewhat curious about this thing: https://residential-acoustics.com/shop/soundproofing/acoustidoor/ \u2026 I have toyed with the idea of completely blocking off the door and just entering/exciting the studio through the exterior door, and one or two of these things could be a decent way to do that with an off the shelf product. (BTW, I\u2019m in a rental.) \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Any thoughts/recs greatly appreciated!",

First things first can you change it out to a solid core door and add weather stripping and some beefed up stops all the way around? You can get special door seal kits with a droppable bottom seal that seals tight to the floor when the door shuts, although these are like 200 bucks a pop and you can get similar if not better results making something yourself. You want to start by figuring out a rough mass per square foot for your wall assembly (include drywall, stud work, insulation etc) and then bring your door up to the same mass per square foot. Solid core door, good seals all the way around and then you can even add more mass to the door with drywall or plywood. Once your door is at least the same mass per square foot as your wall assembly you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere to gain more isolation",
