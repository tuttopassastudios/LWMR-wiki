This is the only place many of us have \u2013 on the internet or otherwise \u2013 that is a healthy, supportive, *non-political* community. We're nearly 2000 people and I fucking love browsing the depth and breadth of conversation on here. There's real love for music and creativity and camaraderie, and it brings me immense joy.\n\nSo to the newbies and experts, the casual lurkers and Grammy-winning essayists, from the bottom of my heart, thank you all. \u2764\ufe0f",

It\u2019s cool to see the beginnings of a community happen. I\u2019m getting all these creative ideas just thinking about what\u2019s possible. It\u2019s also a testament to just DOING things. Even if there isn\u2019t a solid goal in mind. When you do things, you learn things.\"\n\nBig love to @hendrick and @1ggy who were the first ones involved to help make this place happen. I'm so proud of all of you for helping keep this community thriving. You all put kindness and curiosity and patience first, and THAT is what makes this place special. An island in the sea of fuckery that is the internet. I appreciate you all, my friends!",

    "content": "Today I got a reminder of how important love and care are in what we do. Just wanna give a shoutout to @Nomograph Mastering for all the wisdom shared here on that topic.\n\nLong story short \u2014 I agreed to mix a track for an American rapper who had already been turned down by some A-list mixers, even though the guy had a decent budget. The reason was kinda obvious: he\u2019s got a personality that leans toward OCD, with everything that comes with that \u2014 defensive tone in convos, super long mix notes, and weird stuff like thinking a file sounds different just because it was renamed. (I forgot to label one file as \u201cref. limited\u201d like the previous versions, and even though it was literally the exact same file, he swore the \u201cnon-limited\u201d one had a different top end.)\n\nStuff like that made me seriously consider walking away from the project like the others did \u2014 I could just feel the back-and-forth drama coming. But after my first instinct, I remembered a lot of what\u2019s been talked about here: love, care, and being open to the music and the art. So I decided to try empathy instead of just being a jerk out of frustration.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. After taking a bit of time to really talk to him and show I genuinely wanted to help \u2014 not just as a mixer, but as a human \u2014 I learned he\u2019s totally burnt out and running on fumes 'cause he just became a dad. And I totally get that, since my first kid was born a month ago too. That connection shifted the whole vibe. The next round of notes actually made sense, and we ended up approving the first mix by version 4 \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad at all. Happy client, job done.\n\nNot saying you should hang onto toxic clients, but it was a solid reminder: don\u2019t always go with your first reaction. Sometimes just showing a little care  about the person on the other side can change everything. It did for me this time. And tbh, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve handled it this way if I hadn\u2019t read some of the stuff shared here. So thanks, y\u2019all. This place is gold.",

    "content": "So, early in working with Cavallo we we\u2019re doing a project at Skywalker Ranch in Nor Cal, living there for about 6 weeks. And he would unwind by cooking the staff these huge dinners in the industrial kitchen and then when they all retired for the night he would crack a bottle of wine and just talk shop with me for an hour or two. One night we\u2019re talking about mixers, and I mentioned doing a project with another producer where one of the big big big name mixers had tanked the record. And he said \u201cwell whose fault is that?\u201d And I responded the mixers obviously, it was awesome when we sent it to him. And he said \u201cno, with all due respect, it\u2019s the producer\u2019s job. I sent back *grammy winning record here* 12 times to that mixer because the mix was just not quite right. As a producer your only job at the end of the day is \u2018can i stand behind this record, is this the best the artist could possibly put out. Does it rule\u2019. THAT is the job of a producer. A guy like Fields might get there by re playing all the instruments when the band leaves. A guy like Rubin might give them a reading assignment. They\u2019re both equally producers because at the end of the day their records are consistently quality, however they get there. THAT is the job. The rest is just details\u201d\n\nThe people that know how will always work for the people that know why. \n\nThat lesson was invaluable to me.",

Moving to Australia to join a band in my early 20s got me excommunicated from half of my family, some of whom I didn\u2019t get to talk to for nearly a decade. Some had credible experience in the industry, others just in life, but truthfully, if you care about someone\u2019s quality of life and ability to provide for themselves and hopefully a family, you don\u2019t steer them towards a career in music. \n\nBut, I wouldn\u2019t be told no, and every time I was pushed away from something I wanted to do (I couldn\u2019t go to school in LA because it was too close to the industry) I ended up somewhere that actually furthered my career (I ended up in San Diego, where I became friends with the Switchfoot guys which really helped launch me). It\u2019s why I have such little patience for the \u201coh the studio manager was short with me while I was an assistant\u201d crowd\u2026 if you want it bad enough, you figure out a way to make it work. And if you don\u2019t want it bad enough, there\u2019s a hundred more guys like me that do, that are willing to sacrifice their time/health/money/etc to the cause. I don\u2019t say that to frame it as admirable or healthy or anything positive, it\u2019s just the truth of how things are. \n\nSo, that person that\u2019s going to quit because a studio manager was challenging, or a teacher didn\u2019t like their song? They\u2019re going to get devoured by the people that really dedicate their lives to this, and it feels cruel to tell them otherwise.",

    "content": "God I love this discord. \nTo me 90% of the reason big producers are paying many thousands a day to be in a studio the past 15-20 years is to just not have to worry about shit. Anyone can make a record at home these days; part of being in an \u201cactual\u201d studio is the cocoon of creativity. If the assistant takes more than a couple of minutes to patch anything in, bring up the piano, or recommend the best Thai place in town, they\u2019re blowing it. I had an assistant once at this place famous for making cookies on site, bring me my normal plate of cookies I always ask for and while I was comping I ate half of one, put it back on the plate, and continued working. He didn\u2019t say a word, got up, grabbed the plate, and disappeared for a few minutes and came back. \u201cHey man, I know you normally house the entire plate of cookies so when you put that one back I checked with the kitchen and last week I guess they changed the cookie recipe, and they\u2019re gonna make em like they used to for you.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I asked for that dude every session after, less for the cookies but more for the insane attention to detail and telepathy. One of max\u2019s engineers started as a Conway assistant, and as good of an engineer as he was he also prepped the best Hookahs and was just a great hang. Max ended up hiring him for his own studio. We\u2019re in a people business, try to be attentive and a good person to have around, for all the reasons that go beyond knowing how to set an attack on an 1176. \n\nThe flip side is, if you\u2019re booking a studio as a producer, the assistants are what really make the studio run. Treat them well. Know their names. Give them credit. No assistant on any session I ever did paid for their own meal, they got what the artist got.  They most of the time got engineer credits. Help them along. As with all things, mutual respect goes a long way.",

Seemed to go way past \"i love mixing and here's all the reasons i'm the shit\" and it was inspiring to see the ego leave the equation. His decades of experience are playing directly into his ability to access the story of the song and present it in a compelling, live-feeling way. He mixes from inside the song and performs. Well, he does discovery, then shapes the sounds, then performs just about everything on faders.\n-The biggest wake up call to me is that a lot of moves i've made on mixes did not have a good reason behind them. So continuing to ask \"why\" as I work is gonna be important, because I have to start catching myself and adjusting when the answer to \"why\" is \"because someone said this preset is cool\" or \"because this is what I do to a vocal/guitar/drums\". I feel music very deeply, it's why i got into this, but I feel like i've been poisoned against trusting that instinct and convinced that what we do is a technical job. I'm done being an observer of the art, i want to be bold.\n-It's critical to build trust with clients right away, you can't assume anything in what they understand about how you feel. Telling them you love the song and you're excited to mix it is important, and never blaming production/artist/anything else for the mix being less than what it should be. never okay to say \"i did my best\", because that gives you an out and implies somebody else could do it better\n-Therefore, you must believe when you sit down to mix that nobody is gonna interpret this song better than you.\n-Generally i'm skeptical to just take on someone else's \"method\" and start operating in that space just becuase of the success they've had with it. Putting this week into practice is going to mean using his template to get reps in, listening and feeling and interacting in a new way and letting my brain \"level up\", if you will, then zooming out and making it my own.\n\n\nI can distill this more and want to share about a couple other specifics, but I just realized I grabbed someone else's notebook by mistake when I left on the last day so I'll need to have them mail mine back to me.",

For us it is more or less the whole pie. and a big responsibility we carry (perhaps without realizing?) is that it is our job to protect the artist from getting  stressed out by the process. and this extends to processing and managing our own stress about the work should it exist, as stress is a contagious energy.",

I also get the working in music/freelance lifestyle, and sometimes its hard to even want to do fun things outside of it when you're so focused on this thing that really excites you that also is your livelyhood.\n\nIts such a hard thing to get right and in my experience with certain partners, its been an ongoing arguement, even in the past when i've had salary jobs and a very predictable schedule. So i'm not sure it goes away by making your life more regimented. I think the only answer here is being super open and radically honest about everything. \n\nIn my experience, letting your partner know when you've been asked to do something before you've agreed to it, makes them feel like they're a part of the thought process behind the work and less like they're just observing you living your life from the outside. Even if you were always gonna say yes to it anyway, at least they feel like they have some control and are on the same team as you. IME you just gotta go out of your way to make them feel like they're doing it all with you. They feel closer to you in a situation where they could just as easily feel like they're being pushed away. I'm not sure what way you've went about it, thats just my experience. If you're living with your partner you kinda have to see yourselves as the same person working toward the same thing, as opposed to two individuals with their own lives.\n\nAlso going out of your way to be spontaneous and do something fun and/or stupid like you're teenagers when things arent as busy goes a long way when things are.",

Give me a call when you get a chance would ya?\" \n\nNot knowing my demise, I thought I would flex and call him in front of my gf on speakerphone where the first words out of his mouth were: \"Thanks for sending those stems so fast.

    "content": "Ok Tl;dr- where you are matters as much as who you are. \n\nI\u2019m also from a small town, moved to LA trying to get famous and got my ass handed to me by artists who were better looking & more talented and yet were still struggling to be seen. But I kept at it because I\u2019m tenacious, (read: delusional, as all artists must be.)\n\nI was able to work *for* some of those artists cause I had a diverse skillset, and I was full time music after about 4 years, by the time I was 26. Doing gigs at hotels and playing guitar or recording for other people, teaching guitar, leading music at churches, all the while pouring evening last ounce of money & energy into my artist career, until my last real artist project broke up the week we were supposed to sign our first record deal. I was 36. \n\nThat\u2019s when I moved to Nashville and really gave myself over to music directing and producing and writing for other artists. I did it as a consolation while I regrouped to find my next thing, but for some reason, when I made the move all the sudden my whole career made sense to me. \n\nAs it turns out, my real joy comes not from the sound of my own voice, but from helping others find theirs. When I acquiesced to that very real, very culturally counterintuitive calling, I thrived. \n\nAll the sudden I was playing music with and for a bunch of my heroes, and all my friends who were artists starting getting famous. And (shocker) I was really glad I wasn\u2019t one of them. \n\nI always thought that my calling was to help people feel less alone in the world, and that the music I made was the vehicle for that calling. In the end, it turns out it was the relationships i built through music that were the real vehicle.  \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out who I was, and the cities I was in played a huge role in that story. Nashville built its whole industry on people who want to *help* artists, not just *be* artists. \n\nI miss LA every day but I\u2019m in the right place. So, my friend, where is the right place for you?",

That\u2019s niching down a little too hard a little too early.\n\nI think it\u2019s our job to find the essence within something and maximally bring that essence out. Often these \u201ctaste mismatch\u201d issues come across to me as missing that essence within the thing you\u2019re working on and trying to make it something that it essentially isn\u2019t. ie. A wannabe Max Martin working with a wannabe mitski and the producer complaining that the artist\u2019s suggestions are making the production hashy and the artist complaining that the producer\u2019s production choices don\u2019t convey enough emotion. \n\nIt\u2019s talking past each-other and not really collaborating. You aren\u2019t learning to truly love what your partner loves, which IMO is frankly a big part of the job.",

For whatever reason, the lane I\u2019ve ended up in (and the skill set I\u2019ve honed) is taking less than ideal recordings and productions, and making them sound professional. I often find myself thinking \u201cif I was recording this, I would have done xyz\u201d. So it\u2019s time to get back into the studio and get things right from the start. Mixing full time is also quite lonely. Pre covid, I was used to being surrounded by interesting, creative people\u2026 now most of my interactions are remote. And despite Jon and some other people\u2019s thoughts, I find in person revision sessions to be inefficient and usually unfruitful. So, time to record some stuff.",

But it took years of patiently learning the ropes at the highest level to be trusted by the folks in the highest circles. I look back upon that now and I\u2019m still amazed that I was paid to do that. It was essentially like a paid college degree in making records.\n\nSo now when I go into studios with a big client, I see the assistant through those eyes. I\u2019m kind but communicative. If they can hang in the back and figure out how I work, anticipate breaks \u2014 get the menu book ready \u2014 know that we\u2019re going to change gears \u2014 start setting up for that \u2014 then they get looped in. They get my running commentary on what techniques I\u2019m doing. They get the inside baseball\u2026 \u201cI wish they fired this fucking drummer\u201d. \n\nI agree with Ruairi that this type of coming up through the ranks is a loss for up and comers. It was tried and true way to make people understand the ins and outs of studio technique, etiquette, professionalism. I\u2019m glad I got to ride one of the last waves of it. I wouldn\u2019t be here making records at this level if it weren\u2019t for the opportunities I had at the bottom levels of the industry.",

    "content": "To piggyback on @cian riordan 's point, there are real, tangible benefits to being quiet in the back of the room. I would love to be a fly on the wall while @BatMeckley is producing a chart-topping vocalist, or see how Cian works through a first pass of a mix for his next Grammy-winning client. I guarantee they've learned a thing or two about how to talk to sensitive, demanding, highly respected artists. And they've learned how to interpret vague feedback (\"make the vocal less green\")  and working with people who can't articulate what they want. These are things you can't learn by watching Youtube videos or going to school.\n\nWhen I was an assistant at Remote Control, getting to sit in and see how Hans handles a note from Jerry Bruckheimer taught me more than years of music education. Watching my boss struggle for 6 months on a 10-minute cue and then sit in a meeting with grace and calm while he's being told to change everything he just spent many long nights working on. \n\nThat's not to mention things like learning how the real pros handle file management, deliveries, deadlines, tech problems, etc.. There is so much beyond learning the gear that comes from being a good assistant. If Matt knows you're going to shut up AND have his back with lackluster cookies, he's going to let you hang in the room longer. Which means you can absorb and learn more. It's a win-win.",

For me, getting out of my own way is not over analyzing every step I take and re-litigating every mix decision to the point where I end up only releasing a handful of songs every few years.  At some point, no matter what our individual issues are, we have to log off the internet and actually make music instead of constantly talking about all of the individual reasons why we can\u2019t. Sometimes, at least in my case, we get analysis paralysis because it\u2019s easier than actually hitting record and just doing the damn thing. There was this meme going around last week that was something along the line of \u201coh hey task that only took me 15 minutes but I\u2019ve been putting off for 5 months\u201d.

Despite his very explicit statements about hating political division, it has of course been wildly politicized because everything on the internet is these days.\n\nThe second song is a white male country singer covering a black lesbian female's iconic song ALSO about class. Talk about intersectionality...\n\nThe third song is the longest running solo male #1 song on the Hot 100 from the biggest star in country music (and really one of the biggest stars in the world... just, again, not covered by the current fashion of mainstream culture). It's a kinda-country-but-kinda-just-pop song co-written by the biggest country writer in history (Ashley Gorley) as well as once-rapper-and-Dr-luke-protege J Kash.\n\nThe rest of the chart is interesting too. #4 is a four year old taylor swift song that has gained traction online from her current tour so the label started pushing it as a single. \n\nThere are two Olivia Rodrigo songs, signaling a true new superstar.\n\nThere are two songs from the Barbie soundtrack. In a \"dying\" movie industry currently on strike, when is the last time two songs from a movie soundtrack have been in the top 10? I dunno.\n\nAnd lastly, there's only 1 trap song. The majority of these songs are people playing real instruments and writing more \"classic\" singer-songwriter songs. Rap music is really having a lull after a decade of dominance.",

While she was making her entrance on stage something weird happened to the sound. Loud pop, clicking, and then no signal, but seemed like the in-ears / on stage monitoring were still working. Her and the band played through the entire first song while everyone in the audience was just looking around confused. Many heads turning to the sound board. Eventually the crowd started a 'we can't hear you' chant and Janelle and the band realized what was going on. They all calmly walked off stage. Took maybe ten minutes for it all to get sorted with the sound. Then Janelle and her band proceeded to come back out redo the entire intro / first song and give maybe the greatest live performance I've ever witnessed. The show ended with a double encore. It felt like such an amazing example of class and professionalism. I got the sense that she decided, after walking off the stage the first time, that not a single person in the audience will remember this show being anything but amazing and it was. Truly undeniable. If anyone here has a chance to catch any of the remaining shows on her tour, I could not recommend it enough. \ud83e\udd18",

    "content": "Coincidentally I was exploring a similar idea this morning. I'm on a David Bohm kick and was reading his book 'On Dialogue' and recently finished his 'On Creativity' (would highly recommend both).\n\nIn 'On Dialogue' he gives an example I think can be repurposed here. Imagine a song being presented to us. An external signal. When it reaches us it makes contact with what Bohm calls the \"whole movement of thought\". The thinking and feeling apparatus within us is activated. Thoughts and 'felts' are said to be fundamentally created from memory. Upon contact a 're-presentation' is created where the activity of our thought and feeling reforms the event internally. The 'net presentation' is the fused result. 'Mis-representation' occurs when we mistake the 'net presentation' for the original.\n\nI was thinking on all this and how it might connect to your comment from yesterday, \"I told Jon that I don't think he's ever brought more to an album, but also left less of his fingerprints on it\".\n\nBohm brings up Michael Polanyi's idea of tacit knowledge. This is the always running in the background implicit structure we attend to music from, which makes 're-presentation' possible. This includes nostalgia for records we love, perceptual training, bodily memory, tolerance for brightness, etc... Implied here is that this is something you cannot turn off but can cultivate greater awareness off in disciplined participation with art. Polanyi says we attend from subsidiaries to a focal whole. If you start attending to your own sonic fingerprint as the focal object, the structure may collapse. So perhaps Jon was able to integrate a remarkable tacit contribution while being sensitive to the pre-existing structure and coherence of the whole. Maybe coherence and truth have similar meanings here?\n\nDownstream of the artist's origination maybe 'truth' in record making is deep tacit integration, suspending egoic domination, and sensitivity to the internal structure / coherence of the original whole.",

I would not describe that as \"a lot of the mastering processes happening in the mixing stage.\" For me, mastering is the process by which I 100% align the final product with the artistic intent. There's a technical component to that, but there's also a huge component of that that is pure vibe. Can I enhance the feeling of this song without getting in the way? Is the feeling of this song fully realized? Is the feeling of these songs together fully realized? Uncovering all that to me is the job. Sometimes it's already there and there's very little, if anything, to do. The perspective is still valuable. The key here is somebody who both understands the technical aspects of the job as well as somebody who can internalize and FEEL the music.

This role is changing, and we'd all be smart to understand where it's headed.\n\nI get hired to finish songs a lot. Usually that means I have a \"co-producer\" credit. Sometimes it means \"mixer\" credit. Occasionally it's included \"mastering.\" But really what I'm hired for is that combination of experience and technical knowledge. I'm an outside ear who knows how to fix what's missing. This role of \"finisher\" is really where a lot of the producer/ mixer/ mastering engineer profession is headed. The distinction between those roles is getting blurrier. \n\nMixing engineers have moved from pulling up faders on the console and creating a mix (old school \"mixers\") to often just pulling up the rough mix of stems and making finishing touches (Jon, Manny, Serban, Tony, Bainz, etc.).\n\nIn this way, the \"mixing engineer\" profession is moving away from manipulating raw sounds to manipulating nearly finished mixes. This is sounding more and more like what a \"mastering engineer\" does. Now there's \"stem mixing\" and \"stem mastering\" too, further blurring the lines. These are all just slightly different configurations of the same thing. Who do you hire to get perspective and then act on it?\n\nThose of us that are finishers or mixers or mastering engineers or whatever would be smart to think about how to adapt to the direction this is all headed. \n\nI want us all to win. I think we need to step back and expand how we think about the roles. It's the best way for us all to have careers.",

Very often that runs counter to conventional wisdom around writing songs in \"a way that people actually like.\"\n\nSometimes I feel as if I'm out here in the woods building a tiny little cathedral just for myself and a small group of people who stumbled upon it.

I'm not going to get grumpy when my art doesn't pay off for me. I've got no illusions there.

Had a client reach out with a tight 2 day deadline right ahead of a move and I passed politely and recommended another engineer who said yes then bailed on the project 24 hours later It was my word so I jumped in and hired my other friend to split the fee with me and we got a royal amount of editing done in 24 hours and I got my client hooked up and happy.

Cutting edge in creative pursuits, but classics in my personal taste. Specialist in my mode of expression, and generalist in my interests.\n\nThe more I subdivide and examine the question the more I find exceptions to everything. I am steeped in knowledge, but I seek wisdom above most things, which some philosophies would consider contradictory.\n\nThis Anais Nin quote comes to mind:\n\n> \"We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.

We are made of layers, cells, constellations.\"\n\nI think people are extremely lopsided and unbalanced when you start to drill down into their psyches, and that's wonderful! \n\nFor the sake of refining this question and narrowing the scope, should we confine these three axis to only record making?

    "content": "i think the premise of this stems from the constant fight that i feel like we all face....wanting something to be the \"best\" it can be (at least in our personal minds and perspectives) vs the sometimes reality that we are hired to do a \"job\" and not everything is going to meet our expectations of what we personally think is great, because at the end of the day, we aren't the artist...or in some cases, even the intended audience. with that said...if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. / might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it...so who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. this is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world...but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

Trying to bottle everything into a 9-5 was difficult for me.. why are artists calling me at 9pm? Well.. that's when they are off from their day job and can talk. I took that boundary away for myself and felt some self imposed frustration melt away. Grateful for the calls, emails, texts, DMs.. any hours.

There\u2019s a camaraderie and kinship in physical labour on construction projects, and an embodied intelligence in that world that offsets the subjective and (for me) atomised work of hours alone mixing.\n\nWhen I\u2019m doing construction work, I\u2019m also free to think objectively and from a distance about my audio engineering work.\n\nMost of all, something changes for me when I\u2019m being paid for musical \u201cwork\u201d that I\u2019m not entirely happy with. I\u2019ve discussed this privately with a few folks here, and it seems the relationship between music and its commodification is problematic for more than a few of us. Simply put, it\u2019s sometimes less enjoyable \u2014 though equally amazing \u2014 being paid for a passion.\n\nI couldn\u2019t recommend a construction or skilled trade career enough. It\u2019s incredibly flexible and offers a tonic to music careers: you know you can walk onto a site tomorrow and get paid quickly and well. It\u2019s always going to be around, and in my case, the certifications allow me to consider migrating to most economies globally as a skilled worker.\n\nConstruction allows me to be my own patron for my musical endeavours, and that feels really good.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a bigger debate here about how working in the upper echelons of the music industry feels long term \u2014 challenges, payoffs, economics, job security, retirement, healthcare, family life versus work life, and a world where socialising is networking.\n\nConstruction is a simpler engagement: competency, find a solution, do the work, go home.\n\nI came across @cian riordan discussing becoming a fireman on Conversations, and much of what you said, Cian, is exactly what I get from construction.\n\nI love how for you, though \u2014 instead of the firehouse bell calling, it was multiple Grammys!",

This is a very special corner on the internet for me, and I swear that everytime I read your convos (even the ones I don't interact with) I always take something new with me (a new approach, a bit of inspiration, some insight on how to deal with different situations) and feel grateful for everything that is shared.

The time commitment in and out of the classroom between 6 classes makes it almost impossible for me to be able to adhere to anyone else\u2019s schedules, whether that be as a freelancer or assistant. I like to think a smart trusted friend would agree but I\u2019d also wanna know if there\u2019s anything else they\u2019re seeing. \n\nI wanna use my time in school to give back this year. Even though I can\u2019t do music full time I\u2019ve been freelancing. While I wanna scale up after school, a lot of the people I\u2019ve worked with are coming back now because they feel they can\u2019t go to another engineer where we\u2019re at and \nget the same quality/experience they\u2019re getting from me, and they can\u2019t afford to go to bigger studios/engineers either. I\u2019ve also had a lot of people make comments about how much they like my rooms vs other studios they\u2019ve worked in. \n\nSo while I\u2019m in school I wanna offer my rooms to other people who are serious about their music so they can take their stuff to a level they\u2019re happy with and is pro sounding enough. It really bums me out when I see people in the local scene who are super good, passionate, and hardworking when it comes to creating their music met with roadblocks caused by bad rooms, poor engineering, and economics. \n\nIf anyone wants to chime in with ideas, I\u2019m thinking of offering a free session to students at my university to come record with me/just letting friends I trust into my spaces to use while I\u2019m in class or whatever",

One of things that frustrates me to no end is the belief that there's a \"How to\" checklist for how to get good. The answer is there is no answer and it looks different for everybody. I can certainly tell you the principles and strategies for how you might get good. But you need to find your own way and do the work. And sometimes that is quite literally grinding until you break through. People don't like hearing that there really is no answer (and they think you're being a dick for telling them there isn't one...which is a whole other thing). I think the ubiquitous accessibility of information has trained a generation to expect answers to be a Google or one weird trick away.",

To use your analogy, dating a new girl feels different than a year in, vs. being married, vs. having a family. It's absolutely normal for the type of love you have for music to evolve over time and repetition.\n\nI kind of doubt that earning money from music is the root cause of your feelings. But it might be affecting how you encounter music. If it's all feeling too ordinary, then break the ordinary. Go listen to live music that's far away from anything you touch. Pick up an instrument you don't know how to play and get in a room with some friends and enjoy being bad, but exploring music like a child. \n\nThe \"quitting\" thing often feels like something often born out of rough working experiences, or perhaps just too mundane. Bills have to get paid (burgers gotta get flipped) but perhaps you can balance those gigs with things that challenge and excite you, even if they're not particularly lucrative. \n\ntl;dr I think we all go through phases of questioning if the career is worth it, if not questioning our relationship with music itself, but in my experience, almost everyone comes out the other side after a bit of a mental reset.",

Gas is $80. An egg sandwich is $16 lol.

A _lot_ of people in LA are doing the same: _side hustles are your friend_ . \n\nAnother thing i'd add is when you first move here, try to combine your studio and living expenses. Studio spots here start at like $1800 a month and go up from there. I live in a beautiful house in silverlake with roommates where I have a room, my own bathroom, _and my own studio_ in the furnished garage for $1300. Try to get something like that.",

There\u2019s a right and a wrong way to do it, and a price to come in at. (These rivets will hold up under this amount of stress up against this material so your plane doesn\u2019t fall out of the sky). With music and production, the goal is a lot more amorphous, especially outside of pure radio pop production (I\u2019ve already beaten that horse dead here.) The concepts of done and value are much harder to define because it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder. \n\nThen, there\u2019s the specific people. Most people that are in software or data management didn\u2019t grow up going \u201cI WANNA BE IN DATA MANAGEMENT\u201d. They fell in to the field because they had an aptitude for it, were good at numbers, and it was a good way to make money so they can pursue their passion outside their job. With musicians, they specifically ran from that kind of life, the music IS the passion. A guy like cian or Noah could make a factor of 10 time more money in another field, but the emotional value they get from their work supersedes that.\n\nIt\u2019s just chalk and cheese.",

LOVE how it sits on the edge there, but I\u2019m a big Jon fan so no surprise\n\n2. Disco Break 2 by Brasstracks (Castelli Mix/Becker master) \u2014 crazy good and deep transients with a wonderfully articulate but big low end. Quite dynamic, maybe slightly on the edge there so great to study translation to streaming. Recommended to me by the wonderful @YianniAP \n\n3. 30 for 30 - T Shyne. Not quite sure who mixed it, but I actually DON\u2019T like the lows, or really the overall mix that much as an engineer but there is such a wonderful energy to me, this thing played before a sports game or a workout is it. So I have it here to remind myself that not everything has to be amazing sonically to feel great. Actually don\u2019t like the low end on this at all, but the record still hits for me. Told @alexstein this was on the warm up list\u2026he was like \u201cwhy??\u201d haha. Because I think my job is to love records for what they are and understand why they work, hopefully be more of themselves, not some target curve that\u2019s ideal to me. and this is a great example of something like that\n\nAlso just have to mention that \u201cTattoos\u201d by Georgia Webster is on there\u2026probably my favorite vocal I\u2019ve ever heard. @YianniAP mix Nathan master, I cannot look away from the vocal and the mid density is perfection to me",

Being a whole human is an important and underrated strategy for growth. It\u2019s also really difficult in the midst of a crush of work or a grind, but why it\u2019s so important to prioritize time doing other things. Setting clear boundaries and making time for unplugging, exercising, hanging with buds, listening to records, making dinner, taking a walk, watching a show, noodling on bass, making a tune, playing Uno with the family, etc. all do more for my practice than watching a technique video or messing with a plugin or gear agnostic of the context of a real project.",

Just to add one more angle to the mix: most of you have been referring to agency as some kind of positive trait that you either have or you don\u2019t have it \u2014 almost commodifying it. What if we think of agency, or the qualities of having agency no matter what term we use, as the norm? As in EVERYONE has it. And whether or not we are able to fulfill those qualities and/or desires is due to limiting factors, whether they are external forces (class system, institutional racism, gender discrimination, war, peer pressure, financial hardship, lack of resources, etc) or internal struggles (fear, self-doubt, depression, addiction, laziness, inner saboteur, etc) or any combination thereof. I know it\u2019s totally idealistic but maybe if we\u2019re able to think of everyone as being just as capable as the next -- instead of an \u201ceither-you-got-it-or-you-don\u2019t\u201d kind of way, especially in terms of \u201cagency\u201d which sounds like a corporate buzzword du jour -- then we\u2019d be able to focus on and address the aspects of our societal constructs and daily lives that restrict our opportunities to succeed/work/create/thrive/survive/exist.",

Mine is more focused on how I want to hear (or rather deeply understand how I'm hearing) every day as close to consistent as possible, given we are human of course.\n\nMy 2 cents (which of course is just my experience): \n\nSome sort of routine before you work. Mine is that I wake up almost exactly at the same time every day, will work out at similar times (if possible), literally eat the same thing basically every day before during the work day, coffee at similar times, have  the same routine when I sit down to start work. Not all of that is possible or useful for everyone, but I think we can all find something that would focus us in a way that's useful and ablet to be put into practice for us.\n\nTruly I find it helps a lot. We are physical beings, how our systems and bodies interact can definitely matter, especially in our ability to be available to the music.\n\nThat said, sometimes things happen and you gotta go. You will be tired, stressed, whatever. You have to do excellent work under those conditions too, it might be the most important skill if we are being honest about making a career of this. So training specifically for when you feel rough is definitely something I personally find important.  Which is where physically training helps, it's a way to force yourself into (fake) adversity and train response\n\n@Slow Hand I know you know all this, just my experience",

I get wanting to be apart of the creative process, but your part is to capture, not to impose. \n\nSecondly, the minute you start focusing on vocal techniques, its gonna distract you from the things that actually matter. Things like vibe and being a good hang. \n\nThird: singing ideas *at* a vocalist is not nearly as effective as you might think. However good a singer you are, when you sing an idea they\u2019re going to hear so much more than you intend, and will likely mimic things you\u2019re not trying to convey. It can be more detrimental than you\u2019d think. \n\nAll that said- focus on learning each artist individually, create an environment of trust and respect, and when the time is right, you\u2019ll know how  to offer insight.

Totally understand the hesitation to delegate - especially that first 6 months-a year where you're acutely aware that helping someone else do it is *more work* than just rolling up your sleeves and doing it yourself. \n\nFor building systems, what's worked for me is hiring and training your 'double(s)' first - someone with a similar skillset and sensibilities, very broad skills like me (who also did everything myself for a long time). This comes a lot easier if you have close friends in the same lane looking for jobs, I've seen people have their \"double(s)\" move in with them for a limited time too, with the intention of them soaking in exactly all you do.\n\nOnce my double(s) started doing pretty well, we started hiring more specialized people, and the doubles could then oversee their work, feedback etc - early on I would always be part of this, then slowly phase myself out.\n\nWhat I wish I would have done earlier would have been to hire a producer/overseer/manager/'my boss' - someone with a bit more skin in the game/responsibility, and who keeps you in line if you start wavering. \n\nAgain, I didn't love the setup of 10 and dissolved it eventually - as a creative it's easy to feel like you built a house/efficiency machine and one day you wake up and it's a prison that's not as flexible as you want. That's another thing I'm trying to keep in mind (I'm putting together a new similar team for this fall) - how do you keep the team agile and ready to shift when priorities shift? It could be as easy as accepting a little bit more churn & letting people go when they don't fit what's going on, but it's hard to let go of people you've trained and know well. I felt a friendship connection with my entire team, in hindsight I think that was a mistake too.\n\nThose are some thoughts haha - what have you found so far? Are you experiences lining up with mine? What kind of roles are you hiring for?",

What I just realized - and what's interesting to me - is how you can eventually see the big picture and have a zoomed-in, refined, comprehension at the same time.\n\nYou can both hear a mix in totality *and* simultaneously know that the attack time is wrong on a compressor on a single channel, or know that the vocal needs less 500 Hz.\n\nAs we internalize and master these fine perceptual details it feels less like zooming up and down the ladder of detail. Instead they all become flattened. They all exist simultaneously without having to zoom in or out. That's pretty cool!",

Not even with the idea that I was looking for clients but just because I wanted to ingrain myself into the local scene. Music is really tight knit and positive relationships do more than a resume ever could. \nLooking to the question of finding clients to elevate your career. It's a question I have difficulty finding an answer to how I found those types of relationships. The only thing concrete that I can think of is finding the people who match your work ethic. Find the artist who is hungry for success and is working every day on their craft. Because they are in the same spot as you, they are looking for the engineer who will elevate their career and their music. If you have spent the time honing your craft they will see that and you will have a much greater chance of creating a strong relationship and elevating each other.",

For me living in Guatemala, I\u2019ve also seen how cities aren\u2019t just cities for a lot of people. The reality here is that many can\u2019t afford to pay decent rates for many things, so survival often means taking on every job possible. It\u2019s not always about choosing a community but about making ends meet first. That's the reality for me and my peers down here. We are trying to work together at it, but there is no industry or infrastructure yet. I wish it were different.  Still, when you do find the right people, it makes a BIG difference, so community is still always what I keep searching for, make better, and hold on to.  That, and trying to make whatever music comes out the speakers sound the best I can, whatever song is floating in the brain bringing it to paper, and make music with people.",

The degree to which we build upon and leverage what we do have is our puzzle to solve.\n\nI\u2019ve had countless conversations with lost folks who think success and the things they say they want just happen. It is VERY difficult to teach self determination to people who don\u2019t inherently believe that taking direct action toward a goal makes things start to happen. A lot of people don't believe it can be that simple. This doesn't mean it's easy. It can be hard to overcome one\u2019s wiring and circumstances. And sometimes people need to learn the hard way. But, outside of the extreme, everybody\u2019s got the agency to make their desired outcomes happen. Some need to work at it harder than others. For some, it comes easier. And sadly some never realize that their outcomes are in their hands. But what a powerful realization it should be that the things we think we can\u2019t do are often just ourselves telling us we can\u2019t do them, when in fact we absolutely can.",

    "content": "If the alternative is to back home, I\u2019ll try to offer some advice from personal experience. I moved to Richmond, VA for a year, got a job at a hotel doing audio visual. I quit my first commercial/post production gig doing ads full time. It was the worst but I was determined to keep working in music, and try to get integrated in the scene/studio world. It was a serious low for my mental health, the job was terrible, I was struggling and scraping by without any pay off. To make a long story short, I applied for a job back home at a big corporate company with a full time composition/post production gig, on a whim - I didn\u2019t think it would get me anywhere. 3 months later I got the job and went back home after a year. I was out of the music scene back home at this point, and it took another year of reconnecting and working hard on my craft with friends who were willing to let me record their bands for the price  of drums heads and guitar strings, and honestly, those two things combined with some luck put me in a very secure and creative place, now making records for bands again that are paying decently well to boot. I don\u2019t know how far you are in your career/journey, but I\u2019m barely anything and have been recording for 15 years. It took me 5 years out of school to get barely a living wage and working lots of different types of audio jobs while making records, to get to a comfortable place emotionally, creatively, and financially. I\u2019d bet almost anybody in this discord has a very similar story. It takes a long time and like others have said, there\u2019s no one way to get there. Just keep doing you and trying to work on things that you enjoy.",

The job has been able to subsidize what has turned into a parallel career. I have designs on having this be my full time gig at some point, but I'm taking it slow, honing my craft and building my client base and studio while the steady paycheck is there. It's nice to be able to do that without grinding to make ends meet. I realize that is a privileged position to be in so I am grateful. With COVID, I can also crank out masters while I WFH when there's downtime or I need a work break. Some weeks are harder than others from a workload standpoint, but mastering is part of my brain-therapy so I'm happy to take it all on.",

Every remote gig is different and I realize this situation is a lot of luck and circumstance. Don\u2019t be discouraged to take another gig. I was able to pay off high interest cards and can comfortably afford gear when I want it. I was full time in the studio from age 14-31 no other job. It was a transition, but one I\u2019m glad I made. I\u2019m still working mixing full time as well. I do production if I\u2019m stoked on the project. I work with rock bands for context. Just do dope work try not to compare. Remember there are some people with mountains of gear and dope setups they own. much respect to that. Others have rich parents, high interest credit debt, or both. I told myself if I wasn\u2019t rolling in it with a Grammy at 30 I would stop which is a super dumb mindset.

If you can remember that, you\u2019ll find a group and a niche where you feel like you exist and you can grow (and we\u2019re really bad at remembering where we started from, we\u2019re programmed to think in the now).",

I was there for a week and it was palpable from the front-desk to the interns, assistants, musicians, engineer, everyone silently acknowledged their fortune to be working in such hallowed ground. It just made it really clear that every single person cared, and cared deeply. I'm sure not all studios in London are quite like that, but it's stuck with me.\n\nI've worked at all the scoring stages in town and many of the record studios and it's just different here. The closest I've come to experiencing that level of care and respect for the work being done was at Capital. This isn't a judgement about talent, but the demeanor. If an intern or assistant acts like they don't care or aren't as invested as everyone else in the room, it can bring down a session. Or at the very least, it starts to feel like they're in the way, not on your side. If an artist or engineer has mostly had that kind of experience, I can see defaulting to seeing the assistants as \"the help\" instead of an integral part of the team, deservedly so or not.",

(and the big juicy cherry on top \u2014 that album led to my first deal, which is how i broke out of the restaurant, and it still accounts for close to 50% of my yearly income in royalties)  i\u2019m just speaking from personal experience knowing exactly where you\u2019re coming from. i don\u2019t have a family, so i can\u2019t say i relate, but i definitely understand what you\u2019re sharing with us. and to push back on some other points made earlier in this thread, i was actually able to love and feel fulfilled by my service job, even though it kinda sucked, because i knew it was what bought me the time and life to make my favorite record.",

Most businesses charge you for the 4% credit card fee, have minimums they won\u2019t charge below, literally every expense falls on the consumer as to make a profit. I went to a mechanic, a good and honest one, part was $5, took them less than an hour to diagnose and fix the problem, charged $95 for labor. I have no problem with this, but i know that if I sent that invoice as an engineer there would be questions. \n\nWe simply don\u2019t do this. We sweat and bleed for these people and they usually don\u2019t want to pay full price. \n\nAny other service job gets accepted for what it is. Most Musicians don\u2019t have budgets. \n\nThis is speaking at the lower level (indie label and independent bands). I\u2019m sure the big time folks here have different experiences especially with how the 1990\u2019s differed to now.",

The slog at the start are some of my fondest memories. It was so exciting!I think I did this job for 5/6 years living off next to nothing.

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

My job is about realizing someone else's vision and pushing that to be the best it can be. If you're being hired as a producer, then like me, you have to believe that you're being hired for your taste and perspective. So the question is, why doesn't it feel good to you? Is there something undiscovered that could make it better?\n\nI've written a lot of music that's outside of my aesthetic or personal tastes. But if I'm on the project, I'm going to be 100% invested in helping make that thing what it needs to be. There's a way into music that's outside of your vibe - sometimes it's getting excited about new techniques, sometimes it's exploring a genre you're unfamiliar with, and sometimes it's just because the people you're making music with are a good hang. Sometimes, the role of a composer (or producer) is to take their vision and find the version of it that **does **get you excited. We've probably all had that experience of \"I really never listen to X, but this one song/artist is just undeniable.\" So strive for that.",

    "content": "@Jeremy Klein some thoughts on home ownership... my wife and I have done pretty well on our house. We've got a large one for our kids (3 kids, my dad also lived with us when we moved into our current house, so 6 people total) and we do plan to downsize if / when they move out. Current rate is 2.65 (I got a good deal, and spent a little to buy the rate down at the time - payoff on that was like 7 years).\n\nWe kept the old house, and for about 6 months I considered renting it out. I did not enjoy being a landlord, though, and abandoned mission quickly on that. I'd definitely go the prop manager route if I was to even attempt it. Portland rental scene ain't great though.\n\nPrices in Portland specifically... if you chart them out, the more expensive houses aren't doing great, some zip codes aren't doing great, but in general anything in that \"starter home\" range that's also near a decent school has done pretty well.\n\nIn terms of investing in S&P 500 or total market or whatever, I think you can pretty easily see that they're more correlated than not these days. That was the big thing about the housing crash - RE crashed along with the market crash. In the past those could be decorrelated, so \"diversification\" worked in your favor. Housing crashing? Rebalance into stocks. Stocks crashing? Rebalance into RE or REITs. Truthfully, though, that's just not the case anymore. Nothing is safe \ud83d\ude42\n\nI think there's also some psychology here. You can run the numbers, and they do pencil out at times in favor of renting (and I do intend to rent at some point in the future, though I've mostly owned a house). However, being a bit \"house poor\" sure is a good way to do some forced saving. For years my wife and I paid an extra $1k a month toward our house, and had a very low rate, and we really saw our net value go up quickly. It was nice.\n\nOne final thought... you often make money on RE when you buy, not when you sell. Place I'm in (which is in a nice part of Portland up on the Alameda ridge) wasn't selling, and I offered $80k under list, and got it. Put $80k into it in improvements (had an ugly small kitchen) and it's worth a lot more now.\n\nOverall tho? I'm mixed. Bad neighbors suck and you feel stuck with them. Maintenance is a killer (3% a year is about right IME). Sometimes you just don't want to deal with problems. But then... renting sucks too in other ways. Choose your poison! \ud83d\ude42",

Making a career in the music industry is what engineers would call a \"wicked\" problem. It's not something that has a repeatable solution, and what works for someone rarely works the same way for the next person.\n\nThat said, I see that you\u2019re from Boston. I lived there for seven years, and the talent pool in that city is tremendous. I think if you found yourself back home in Boston it would be a worthwhile investment to integrate yourself into the scene of young musicians that are centered around the schools in the Back Bay like Berklee, NEC, and Boston Conservatory. There are some immensely talented, diverse, and creative people from all around the world based at those institutions and they all exist within 8 blocks of each other. It\u2019s rare to have such a concentration of driven musicians all mingling amongst each other. This is a massive resource that you can tap into. They're *all* trying to make something great and explore what's possible.\n\nIt's a unique opportunity to discover collaborators, build relationships, earn experience in your craft, and build strong connections for the future as you grow alongside these people. On top of that, Boston has numerous recording studios where you can intern and assist. There\u2019s a lot of experience to be gained working in a studio that simply won\u2019t be taught to you in a recording program. Supplement that practical experience with hard work, and some book learning and you can do very well for yourself.\n\nThere\u2019s more that I\u2019m not touching-on, but I think if you ended up back in Boston it not be as much as a trade-off as you may think.",

If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

But 50% of my music income are gigs that I\u2019m taking to pay the bills, the rest are projects that I feel somewhat passionate, or very passionate about. \n\nThe living expenses have increased due to inflation and I\u2019m also trying to save up money to get a car, so I am thinking about quitting my current day job to get another day job that will give me more hours. \n\nOn months that I couldn\u2019t make my ends meet, I did little things like snow shoveling for neighbors\u2019 houses. I have not done lawn mowing but any one time gig with no schedule commitment can be a good option. The reason why I had to do this is because my day job wouldn\u2019t give me any more hours. \n\nMy issue lately has been the fact that I live in a very expensive city (Boston, MA), and I am barely making it work. More than 50% of the work I do heavily relies on being on-site (recording, live sound, and some parts of the production process).  If I moved further out from the city- the rent would not get cheaper enough to justify getting a car for the commute. And if I moved out of state to somewhere like Albany, NY or Rhode Island- I will be giving up huge part of my clientele and half of my income.

Having started as an intern, becoming an assistant after a few sessions and only later into engineering new projects and running my own sessions at the studio I work at nowadays, it's really clear to me that is you succeed at being a good assistant, people will trust you and you will be blessed with an opportunity to learn and evolve in a totally different and better way... I still assist some of the my colleague senior engineers and engineers that come to the studio for their own sessions, and I'm always eager to be on that spot... If you're that good and keep your mouth shut, you can only win - either by knowing the coolest people in the industry, by learning the craft, by learning how different people do their thing, different mindsets... And you REALLY learn what it takes for a session to run smoothly and for people to be comfortable in the studio, which will probably be the best skill you'll ever develop in this career... \n\nBeing an assistant is great, and all the assistants I know are usually the coolest people to hang with (and yes, I'm including myself, of course \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude02)",

Let's say you as a producer are not vibeing with the artist's direction / vision for a song, but the artist feels very passionate about their vision. You help them realize their vision all the way through and it still doesn't feel good to you or any other involved party other than the artist. What then?\n\nI'm curious to hear some thoughts on the producer's perspective and the artist's perspective. To paint the extremes a little bit; at what point does being disagreeable as a producer (when dictated by your own taste / gut / intuition) become a hindrance to the project or unprofessional? And for the artist at what point are you getting in your own way so to speak and diminishing the potential outside contribution from collaborators that could level up your work?",

Like when the artist asked for a wetter vocal, we don\u2019t just crank the verb right? We make sure it\u2019s not causing problems mucking up transients etc. same with instrumentation and all. \n2) it\u2019s the artist we\u2019re serving. So when we\u2019re done and have gotten paid, they\u2019re the ones who have to go out and tour it, promote it, share it with they\u2019re moms and kids and SOs etc. They need to be happy with it. \n3) if we can\u2019t make 1 happen, we make 2 happen and move on to the next one. \n\nGenerally I find the more I\u2019m able to serve the artist\u2019s vision, over time the trust grows and they become more interested and even reliant on consensus. But there are always outliers songs and outlier clients and outlier collaborators and outlier artists. \n\nIn the long run, ain\u2019t we all just tryna get it right?",

Except it\u2019s more like owning a business that invests its money in slot machines. \n\nHis first step is gonna be writing 100 songs. Because they\u2019re all gonna be not that great. I think it\u2019s important to instill the idea of not being precious with your art early on because I think we all spent way too long on that one song when we were 18 and it was awful anyway. \n\nThen he needs to connect with other people with the same goals as him. Find or build a community. Play shows as often as possible and see how people react to your music. Save up the little bit of money for studio time. \n\nAfter doing that for like a year or two start recording and keep networking.",

In some cases, even the intended audience. with that said, if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. \n\n/ might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it. \n\nso who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. \n\nthis is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world. but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

The thing with A is that somebody may not always \"look the part.\" In my wife's line of work, it is often a requirement for big companies that their sets for photo shoots be diverse. Many of her best workers that she'd staff are BIPOC -- but don't LOOK like it. And she's had to explain to people how a certain person fits the criteria...which, is really, really weird. And she has often had to disqualify a more qualified BIPOC person to hire somebody less qualified because they look the part. And so the question is...what the hell are we doing if this is about what it looks like vs. the skillset? It's B.",

I am probably guilty of not giving enough context in my original post, which probably sparked some confusion (however everything you guys said was probably useful for the onlookers) \nI will say that this situation has been going on for a while now, and a lot has been done to try and resolve things - but if you knew the specifics of the situation, you may realize why its such a sticky one. (I cant really say it publicly on the internet here, I know some people on the discord are mutual friends, but i can talk more about it in dms if someome wants)\n\nEither way, I'm currently in a situation where I'm lucky enough to be very busy, and working on other records that I'm VERY excited about,  for similar money. I only have so much time and energy and its hard to give my 100% to everything. It deeply bothers me when I cant do everything that I personally can to make a record as good as I think it can be - but at this stage I've to make a  decision, do I spend more time on saving a sinking ship? Or do I let it be, after months of doing what I can, so that I can focus on projects that I'm truly excited about with great people? Im leaning towards the latter I think",

When the production company wants world-class sound, and it's your job to create the budget...   knowing that sample libraries can only take you so far is key to explaining to the client WHY they should allocate budget for humans. \"I can create this with just the computer, and it will sound great....  but it won't sound like your example.  There's a real VALUE to humans playing the music and that extra 10% of the quality you're looking for requires a studio session with real players\" \n\nInstant path to budget upgrade.  Suddenly the expense makes sense to them.  Now you get the pleasure of hiring all your friends and deliverying something that sounds top notch...  and you can take the client on a mind-blowing field-trip.  It took me years to learn this trick...   clients don't want to pay mountains of money extra for you to sit in front of your computer and massage CC lanes....  and if they have a mindblowing time in the studio and the track sounds ALIVE?  You win six different ways.",

There is also a lot of pushing and pulling the artists to fit their expectations instead of serving the art and letting nature take its course. Specifically theres a lot of \"I can't wait to help you realize the full expression of your music and art when we work together!!!!!!!!\" kind of vibe which is great internally but puts off older artists a little bit. I've seen it a lot over the last couple years with young producers and engineers and I wonder if its because of the pandemic, honestly. The whole \"check list to success\" thing is another good point. Some things are not easily repeatable or scalable with the expectation of the same result every time.",

I definitely got a lot of other things out of my Master's program (skills, network, artistic development, my Protools perpetual license, etc) and the degree would qualify me for certain academic jobs if I were to ever go that direction in the future. My main recommendation for grad school would be to do it for more reasons than just the certification and potential pay increase, and ideally find a program where the costs are mostly or entirely covered.",

I'm looking at several avenues for doing this, including an education degree, a research based music education degree, or a popular music degree. \n\nItay and I both know there are a ton of popular music programs out there that aren't worth it but just thought we'd ask if there are any that are!

It isn\u2019t required to be good at all of things because hiring other people is always an option, but starting out- I\u2019m working with projects with lower budgets where people can barely afford to hire a producer. \n\nI want to have one strong path, and strength within those skill sets- but I feel like being well rounded wouldn\u2019t hurt if there is one clear path I want to work on. And it seems to me that the path encompasses many different skills. For example, I would work on my instrumental skills, engineering skills, and arrangement skills- but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily seek to pursue these career paths unless I was asked to because I know that primary focus is in production. I would still take gigs in different areas if the pay my bills, but if I get to a point where I can make full living exclusively from production work- I will not take other gigs unless I\u2019m passionate enough to the point I wouldn\u2019t mind doing them for free. To sum up my thoughts or desires on this- I want to build proficiencies in all areas because I believe they are part of the path I want to go through. Although I wouldn\u2019t necessarily pursue a career in those areas I\u2019m developing but I will still take the gigs until I\u2019m paying all my bills and able to build proper savings solely from one thing I would ultimately want to do. \n\nIt may sound like I\u2019ve already made up my mind, but I\u2019m eager to hear people\u2019s thoughts on this because this is something I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time especially because I hear people say \u201cniche down\u201d or \u201cfocus on one thing\u201d.",

Then if I get more hip hop beats placed I\u2019m more likely to eventually get hired to mix hip hop. I\u2019m trying to push down two rather narrow yet flexible paths to really grow in every area I love.",

After moving to the states I found more restaurant work but kept it to only fri/sat/sun and tried to focus the rest of the week to build contacts and do studio stuff. I got super lucky with my boss who was also in the music thing and very understanding about calling out. It eventually got to the stage where I had to call out like 3 weekends in a row so I made the jump to doing the studio stuff full time. So far it\u2019s been working out and I\u2019ve been lucky to keep a good basis of projects, supplementing quiet periods with studio build stuff. It can be super stressful relying 100 percent on the music thing and it\u2019s ultimately different strokes for diff folks. I\u2019ve seen some people who get really burnt out taking music stuff that they don\u2019t like to pay the bills and conversely I\u2019ve seen people getting burnt out doing other stuff that\u2019s not music getting effected in the same way. Ultimately whatever keeps ya happy and works for you is awesome, burn out is real.",

Just stay consistently making music and trust the process, would be my best advice",

I'm doing 4 octave scale runs with both hands at various tempos to focus on consistency of fingering and of tone. The next frontier is doing a variation of these runs where one hand starts on a scale different interval (going up in 3rds, 4ths, etc...)\n\nThe exercise that's challenging me at the moment has been doing wide arpeggios (sometimes with intervals of a 7th or more) up and down a two octaves. I'm taking it slow and becoming more consistent, but I know I'm likely to start hitting a wall as I get them up to a quicker tempo, hence the renewed focus on really getting my technique right at these tempos.\n\nI've very much internalized the concept of \"Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.\" I'm starting things slow and not moving on until I can do them flawlessly at glacial tempos.\n\n@ehutton21 I think you're right about a teacher. LA is undoubtedly full of good ones. A lesson a week should help me to orient myself in the right direction.\n\nThank you for all of the insight.",

    "content": "From my experience of going to music school and taking a whole bunch of courses that are all over the place in terms of lane of focus- school can offer almost too much. It helps to take some time to digest the information, I had this issue when I was in college and had a chat with some of the graduates and they said it took them years after graduating to decompose information that was learned. If you have doubts on if you should continue it may be useful to take some time off and spend on doing what you wanted to do, continuing to connect with people, or even just take breaks altogether to take a breeze of fresh air, live in outside world. Being in school kind of made me live in a bubble and getting out of that was really precious to me. \n\nDegree is just a piece of paper but academic settings can widen horizons of what you can access on your own in the future without having to rely on someone to feed the knowledge/information. It was very chaotic when I took a whole bunch of unrelated courses in college but they all offered me wide insights on what I could dig deeper into in the future. Did I transform as much as others that focused on one lane (eg. engineering) - then I would say no but I created my own program to gain things that would take me more than a decade to have access to. I wasn\u2019t able to retain everything but it unlocked the ways so I can go there when I need to. \n\nIt always sucked having no time to work on my own stuff, but I saw it as a training period  of my life rather than practical period of life. \n\nMy case is slightly different than yours because I went to college straight without having much real world experience. But TLDR; I think semester or a year off would give you what you need without aborting any of the options!",

The best illustrators are going to have a broad and deep awareness of all styles, modes of presentation, and compositional techniques. They're going to use all of their experience and knowledge to interpret what my needs are and deliver on that. That's not a trivial thing to do. AI's are getting closer, but they're not mind readers.\n\nEven the best contractors have to deal with clients who don't know how to ask for what they want; the \"I'll know it when I see it\" type of client.

The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nOf course there are going to be bell ends from every country (and there were plenty of exceptions - I've had many incredible sessions with North American clients, and some gross sessions with UK clients too), but it happened enough to wonder whether maybe it's a cultural thing?\n\nDoes this hold water with you US folks\u2019 experience? FWIW, I can\u2019t imagine anyone in this Discord treating anyone like that, let alone their colleagues. And of course, my personal experience is probably weighted 80/20 UK/international.",

The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nI want to add to what Ruair\u00ed and Matt B said with another perspective. I've had the privilege of working in some very professional settings, where everyone needs to fade into the background to do their jobs properly, and that's absolutely the case at higher levels. And it makes things work. And everyone's cool about it.\n\nBut much of my work has been as producer, assistant producer or project manager/fixer for people working at decidedly lower levels. \n\nAnd idk how it is in other countries, but we have a glut of people here in the US who have a certificate from a for-profit recording school that says they know what they're doing, who think they're *the shit* for being in the room with some viral star off YouTube/Instagram/TikTok. But don't know how to use a damn patch bay. \n\nAnd when you're on the come up, especially as a writer or producer, you interact with a lot of these people, and you get REALLY sick of them REALLY fast. So that might be the source of some of the condescension you see. It's hard not to get jaded when you have to wade through so much incompetence. I feel like a bitter old man just typing this paragraph tbh but I hope I'm not the only one with this experience.",

When I landed in LA for the first session, my mindset was \u201cI can\u2019t wait to show off all the knowledge and experience I had.\u201d I very quickly ran up against the \u201cnobody-gives-an-absolute-fuck-what-I-have-to-say-about-anything\u201d wall. It was very clear that I was there to sit in the back of the room until I was asked to do something\u2026 order food, help with a mic setup, shuffle cars in the parking lot, etc. Not to mention working for someone like Eric who is extremely self sufficient\u2026 he was terrible at asking me to do things. It was always just quicker for him to do it\u2026 even if it meant getting up from the seat and walking all the way across the studio to adjust something. I made the absolute mistake in my second or third week of suggesting something to the drummer in the band after a performance. Eric overheard and pulled me aside. Basically said something along the lines of \u201cyo, you really can\u2019t do that. If you have an idea, run it through me. Absolutely inappropriate, however well intentioned it was. This was really deflating to me. I went from running the show at my own place to spending 14 hrs a day waiting for something to do.",

More recently, when James Horner died during the scoring of The Magnificent Seven, his assistant/arranger finished the score. \n\nThe difference between this and the pop example is there is no AI technology used to imitate the person, which feels like a parlor trick to me. I am all for finishing unfinished art, but unless there was an express wish from the artist to use their voice via AI tech, then I say make it known what it is. Finish the production by bringing in other people to celebrate the spirit of the original voice. Pay tribute. Sort of like Japanese Kintsugi, where you're drawing attention to what it's not to elevate what it is. (This is not the intention of kintsugi exactly, but I can't think of a better metaphor at the moment).",

The fifth and sixth bars repeat this progression. In the third bar, we use the Neapolitan chord (Bb major), which is a chromatic chord that is built on the lowered second scale degree. It\u2019s called the Neapolitan chord because it was commonly used in classical music from Naples. In the seventh bar, we start to modulate to E minor by using a ii-V-I progression in that key (F#m7b5-B7-E7). This progression is commonly used to modulate to a new key in jazz and other styles of music.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nsheesh",

I think just understanding this career is the long game and if you do good work long enough it\u2019ll eventually pay off.\n\nSometimes you do a record and you lose money or make almost nothing and spend months on it. Another time you\u2019ll spend an hour or two and make a ton of money. It balances out.",

So what ends up happening is that we\u2019re struggling relying on making a living paid by those who are also struggling. \n\nThe culture of music should shift towards the direction where if the artist is able to provide enough values for people to want to hear more work from them, then people should be down to fund it. The issue is that everyone\u2019s expenses are more likely going to be prioritizing commodities over intangible products like music. NFT seemed to attempt commodifying music, but just like modern art paintings- they just became a method of investment for monetization, avoiding taxes, or status; nor it was accessible enough for everyday people to want to get into it.",

Instead of explaining, it\u2019s better to do it and show it.\n\nMy humble take: our job is not necessarily doing what we\u2019re told. it is to take their vision, and take it to a place where they could say \u201cwow- I didn\u2019t know this is what I wanted but this is what I want now\u201d. Which I think is the taste and perspective factor. \n\nIt is case by case of course and some artists could come in with A to Z manual of what they want, which can be cool- or not. I personally find those boring, unless I really admire their vision and it just feel like an honor to be a part of it. I think being a yes man can be a quick way to become dispensable. But someone who is willing to serve by giving you some friction that can turn into some heat \ud83d\udd25 can be someone they find trustworthy and interesting. It\u2019s case by case dependent, some people need perfect aerodynamics to accelerate their vision, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily being a yes man- but rather about just being the right fit for the project and being someone who is fully on board to do what they are asking. \n\nBut I think more importantly- it\u2019s okay to miss. If they don\u2019t like it - then scrap it or give it another go. And it\u2019s also fine if you end up not being the one for the project",

Allowed me to not only be faster than most everyone but also there\u2019s an intuitiveness about it that actually helps you make music, because not having to take your hand off the mouse or \u201cmove it to a certain part of the screen to get it to switch tools\u201d just removes another barrier between what you want and how to get there. A bit like learning an instrument to the point where you can just jam and not have to think about how to play it\u2026 music just starts to flow. \n\nThe downside was if I ever had to  work without it I felt really handicapped, almost like I was in a different DAW.",

If you're designing a dining table set, how does it relate to the room? If you're on a team, how do you support everyone else?\n\nIt's so crucial to understand how things relate to one another. In the case of DJ'ing between sets what role is the music playing? Is it there to warm people up? Is it aligned with the feel of the show? Is it supposed to draw attention to itself? Is it supposed to wind people down? These questions seem so simple, but I continually observe people at events failing to match their environment.",

And the tools make it easier than ever before to do so. I see it as part of the journey, though there's no reason you have to close yourself off to other areas of interest as you grow.",

Everything that concerns \u201cme\u201d starts with working on myself. \n\nBut my belief as someone who makes art; it is my job to be concerned about it, and spend time pondering on it. I\u2019m not responsible or I can\u2019t be for it, it would be an arrogance and narcissism (or ego centric frame of mind at the very least) to believe that I\u2019m responsible for it or matters in any way - but I think believing that what I do would have no impact on others is inconsiderate. \n\nI believe it would help people find things they like if everyone alivned their taste/values to their individuality; rather than the idea of their individuality.\n\nRe: Korea; \nyou bring up a very good point about this. Korea is an extreme case of collectivism over individualism, and my obsession about this probably stems from growing up in that background. I only truly understand two cultures from first hand experience and that is Korean and North American; but it seems that no matter how culture forms, human nature will always be relevant and it\u2019s in our nature to be want to be accepted, feel included. \n\nI believe that American individualist propaganda is a lie. It\u2019s not about being yourself, it\u2019s rather about finding a box to put yourself in for sake of convenience. i believe it mostly has to do with consumerism and the complexity of the society from immigration and various cultures coming together; converging / diverging at different pace even amongst those that share the same cultural roots- which then later becomes nu-gen X-American culture, which is different from the culture of X.

You'd think \"well of course all the sample libraries I bought can do that just as well\"  but not imxp....  its that the sample libraries can do \"an adequate\" job and satisfythe need.  But once you hire world-class players and play it live into mics....  for me it was instantly \"we could've bought every sample library and programmed for days but never gotten this quality\" in the tiny details.  The bow sounds. The players breathing together. Their adaptation to dynamics. The aleatoric sections where advanced techniques were improvised. Samples can be amazing and do things humans can't...  but the inverse is also true.  There are many context where it's got to be live players, or else your track is just \"adequate\"",

Its an open question in my mind, partly born from having seen how musicians and djs in my community in London have quietly built lifelong careers in UKG and Drum n Bass on the back of pure devotion to their crafts and not so much pouring even more effort into self promotion. \nIts an alternative approach imho, that has now delivered a good few of them to a balanced, apparently affluent lifestyle in their 50s. Balanced as in, found the time to have children and build a private life with family as well as pursue a music career. And still going hard on the music , same as they always did.\nWill Teddy Swims be burnt out at 50? Will he still love making music? \nThere are quicker (and legal) ways to make money that enable us to be just as creative Giving  100% of your time to anything just to have a chance at the slim odds of making a living seems unwise imho.",

No one wants to watch someone get drum sounds for hours or any sounds for hours yet we expect the results to sound as if we did.  We have to stay out of the way but always be prepared to catch someone falling.  This job is hard, there are many details that go into making  a session go well.  Id suggest thinking about the things you feel need to go further. Are there ways you can be ahead of the curve ?  Are there ways that you can surprise the room and you can say \u201cI  actually just took care of that, we can move on to the next thing\u201d? We have to be steps ahead of everyone else in the room. Some things do in fact take time and you can decide if doing certain things are disruptive to the flow and you might need to bust it while everyone is getting a coffee or telling the room  \u201c hey gang I need 15 mins to take care of \u2026..\u201d",

    "content": "I can understand the trepidation here. Now that Canva own Affinity, it's not yet clear what their strategy is. My guess is that there are a few reasons for this play:\n\n1. Affinity Studio is now a loss leader for Canva's other offerings, like their (just announced) supplemental AI tool set or their enterprise plans, which I suspect are a big portion of their income compared to their Affinity suite licenses.\n\n2. It eats into Adobe's market share. Making a very competitive alternative to Adobe's flagship software and then offering it for free encourages adoption by users who are ready to jump ship from their Adobe subscriptions or who need software like this and are fine without Adobe's cutting-edge tools (like me).\n\nThere are some positive examples of high-level *free* software that is continues to thrive with no sign of being abandoned, or compromised. Like DaVinci Resolve or Reaper (which is effectively free). There are also some great examples of open source software getting a new lease on life by their steward companies. Namely Musescore and Audacity's recent revamps. \n\nNow Affinity isn't open source, but Musegroup have a large full-time development team that seem to be getting by just fine developing what is effectively free software. If they can do it, then Affinity likely can.\n\nHere's hoping Canva have done the math right before setting out on this course.",

    "content": "I had another job up until the pandemic actually, was working 20+ hours a week, and doing college while working on music, then the pandemic hit and the place I worked at shut down, the business is fully closed now but that's another story. Right now with the government restrictions in Ireland, sooo many businesses are closing and it's near impossible to get a job. \nSo my college then went remote, meaning I had alot more free time on my hands, and no steady income.. This kinda forced me to go all in on production. College finished last May for summer, and I worked hard as fuck on being a better mixer and producer (with the virtual help of Matt and Jon) and also tried to figure ways of making money from it.. Apart from working with local artists (there aint too many here in Dublin) most of the work I got and still get was through soundbetter.com, after a while of grinding I got to a stage where I was and still am, only making a little bit less than the job I was in before, so I can at least survive lol.\n\nBasically long story short, I'm actually kinda full time music right now while finishing off my college degree. Then I've to make a decision of whether I remain fulltime music here, go part time and get a job from my degree, or move to the US or London to pursue music there. It'll prob be one of the latter 2 options cos the scene here is very much in it's early days and not sure if a sustainable career could be had.\nAlso as I said here before I'm very fortunate to live in a country where you can get free education, so debt isn't a worry for me. \n\nThat's my long ass story anyways, since you asked \ud83e\udd23",

There's a lot of people out there with similar unconventional principles to him (like putting load thru knees over toes and back flexion etc) but are definitely much more educated on the topics they're speaking on, and won't block you when you confront them..\n\nId personally reccomend the likes of Jeffery Wolfe (@theflexibull), moses Bernard (@mosesbernard), Dan van zandt (@flexibility.research), Nicholas Simpson (@nicholassimpson_)\n\nI've reached out to them before and they're always very helpful, nice people, I know they often do live videos themselves, maybe it could be worth asking one of them to do a podcast with you..\nI definitely don't consider myself an expert on this stuff, but I feel I have a very good base knowledge on health and fitness, I've been heavily involved in track and feild most my life, competed internationally too, so keeping strong, flexible and pain free is definitely something I've experience in lol",

Easily the first half of my time in the bay was just constant anxiety about how I\u2019ll pay rent/will I work/blah blah. Then things got more solid and I could take my foot off the gas a bit. Was able to relax and feel confident I could make ends meet. Then I blew it all up and moved to LA to start over again! Ha.

Has there been an in-depth discussion on live or in discord yet about musicians on tiktok? \n\nIt's a crazy scene of selling your creative soul for 1 minute of attempting to go viral. and then if you do get a popular video, whatever that one was - that is now your thing... singing into a trash can doing RHCP covers... ok, now do another 100 of those.  I see so much talent on there, genuine talent and artists who have worked hard on their craft getting 10 views due to the algo... once the algo has tried your vid on a few people and it didn't stick the vid is dead... so it's totally hit and miss based on your first small sample of viewers.\n\nI see this having a huge impact in many ways. On the plus - you are getting exposure to incredible new ideas, skills, trends, methods for being creative... on the negative it's demotivating to the nth degree, and cheapening the creative process, in my opinion.\n\nMatt and Jon recently talked about track lengths getting shorter and shorter, now 2 minutes is the normal. Partly due to the attention span of people... well what is this going to do... 1 minute pop tracks incoming? Just gimme the hook in 30 seconds and let's move on please. :p. How can we get young people to lay on the floor and listen to 10 minute vinyl tracks again? In my opinion humanity NEEDS this :)) \n\nI also swear I've heard the influence of trending memes from tiktok coming through in music in the charts, but cannot really back this up.\n\nWhat's everyone else's thoughts? I have a friend in LA who says everyone has gone crazy there for tiktok fame? \ud83d\ude1b",

    "content": "I agree with matt that hiring a mastering engineer is a luxury in the present day tbh. Most of the records that I get to mix or produce I'm expected to deliver a finished product ready to release. However when a lot of things are at stake (label release) it's almost 100% sure that a mastering engineer will take care to finish the record, do some QC and especially keep a human touch to the art. Would a co-mixer be able to do that? possibly, depending on their skillset/experience.\n\nwith the use of AI and other systems the expense of hiring a mastering engineer is already fading away but only for projects that are less risky. Say, if you have a tape library of 500 symphonic recordings and need to submit it for streaming so a few folks can listen to it, labels will most likely get an automated system for that to make sure that the standard levels are ok and that it translates well. I'm sure there would be a hungry mastering engineer willing to get that done but the industry is past that era",

My girlfriend\u2019s work is out on this side of the valley, which is what brought us here. We\u2019re technically in Chatsworth, but our place is in a pocket of unincorporated weirdness in the hills. If it felt like suburbia I\u2019d fucking off myself, but it feels like a small town in New Mexico. (Used to film westerns out here.) If my girlfriend didn\u2019t have a great job with an awful commute from our old place, we wouldn\u2019t have moved\u2014until maybe several years down the road buying a house in, like, Altadena or something. But here we are! Now I just drive a lil longer to get to a show or a bar, whenever I go to one. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Long story short: LA (and greater LA) is huge and if you look around you can find loads of different options.\n\nAlso I\u2019ll say I would NOT have wanted to live where I am now when I first moved here. Living in Los Feliz was awesome for being central and meeting people/getting my bearings, and LA being LA maybe there was some superficial bullshit cachet to being able to say I live in the cool part of town. I am less oriented to the pop world specifically, but Los Feliz/Silverlake/Echo Park/Highland Park/Atwater are all the places where the shit I think is cool and exciting happens. If anyone is considering a move to LA, I\u2019d really recommend finding a place close to where the shows/people are that you\u2019re interested in. Live there and rent for a while.",

I have easily gotten 10+ projects this year from doing this. It's not all my work but it's been shockingly useful. THAT SAID, it is almost entirely from people I already knew, or friends of friends. You know this, but it's an effective way to keep YOU in people's front of mind for picking someone for a job, at least for independent projects.That's what it came down to. \"Oh yeah, they are an engineer, I'll hit them up\". A lot of work has been fully completed THROUGH the instagram DM's. It's genuinely insane to me but it's worked.\n\nI think social media can and will be what you make of it. It's easy to be addicted (I definitely struggle with this) but 90% of what I am reading, ingesting, etc is all audio based. Lots of people post political stuff, news, or personal stuff and I can't entirely avoid it but for the most part I do compared to what I realize other people's feeds consist of.\n\nI think instagram has worked for me, but it certainly won't make or break your career if you don't do good work in the first place. If you currently have 0 clients, it probably won't get you more clients. I legit think I have 300 followers which is embarrassingly low. My account is private. it still has worked for me, at this juncture in my career. I also have enjoyed the community aspect of engineers on insta and discord. \n\nEvery interaction or project can lead to something new. That's why for a lot of people, saying \"yes\" to everything is the best at the beginning until you are doing so much that you have the freedom to say no.  thanks for coming to my Ted-X talk.",

He asked if I could come down to LA that weekend to interview/hang-out -- so I got on a plane. At the end of the weekend he hired me and basically said, \"record starts in two weeks -- can you get down here?\". I had to move out of my studio, pack up my life, find a place to live, and get down to make it happen. Obviously that was a great opportunity and most folks in my position would trip over themselves to make it happen -- but I always wondered had I had a day-job with real obligations and financial leverage over my life, would I have been able to make the timeline work... probably not!",

Basically whatever you think you can afford in a mortgage payment, add a few hundred a month to account for the extra bits. And to echo @Cian - the mortgage process gave me heart palpitations and definitely knocked a few years off my life. As a freelancer, it is an actual nightmare.

    "content": "Speaking as someone who moved to the US, there are a lot of things that will make you miss Europe sorely. Mainly quality of life things, especially if you're moving to Texas (although ATX is not so bad)\n\nFirst, as people have mentioned, this country is massive. Everything is disproportionately large and far away. You will drive everywhere, which as a German you might not have an issue with, but it gets annoying when you want to pop over to the corner store to grab something and then you remember that doesn't exist, and then you're driving 30 minutes on the highway to the supermarket just to get two things. Normal errands will take you ridiculous amounts of time if you're not in a dense city, particularly east coast cities (NYC ftw)\n\nNext, there's the increasingly Kafkaesque nature of every commercial interaction in the US. People are generally not paid enough relative to their cost of living and are constantly stressed by student debt, credit card debt, auto debt, mortgage debt (if they're lucky enough), etc. As a result, those in many public-facing service jobs do not do their jobs very well. Sorting out a minor problem can easily involve hours of slogging through telephone menus and talking to service reps who can't really help you. An example is it recently took me over a month and 20+ calls to 4 different places to switch my health insurance, which is supposed to take a week at most through an internet portal (Healthcare.gov)",

Depending on the engineer (lol) they may not even touch gain pots or much gear\u2026 That role really is the grease that lets the gears turn in a session. Kinda the center hub of musical AND technical communication. Would love to hear what that experience is like in other places!",

What i would worry about is connecting your vocal chords to your ears and brain. technique and breathing isn't something to worry about just yet. A teacher/mentor can be great for guidance. But they can be expensive. A few lessons could def put you in a direction. I would start with ear training learning to hear melodies. Usually when people are unable to hit a note it has less to do with technique and more to do with their ability to decern pitch and notes. \n\nStarting out is always tough, but start by singing everyday, sing along to your favourite songs. also try and pull up a piano and press a key and then sing the note, then press another key and sing that note, this will teach you to actively target notes with your voice/ears. Learn to sing simple songs on your own without any backing tracks or music. Nursery rhymes are great, they are simple and a lot of people have them internalised. When you get some more confidance, try and have a static chord or note, and sing different notes on top of it and see how the different notes feel / sound and really internalise that.",

I\u2019ve been in so many sessions where I\u2019ve recorded an artist and they ask for a harmony advice, or even if we are vocal producing, being able to quickly sing a line to quickly reference a point in the song is so much.

    "content": "An interesting side note re: the psychoacoustic HRTF binaural sound localization discussion from yesterday\u2019s live with @Nomograph Mastering :\n\nI can\u2019t find my source right now but if/when I do I will link it, anyways\u2026 A study was conducted wherein moulds were cast of several people\u2019s pinnae (outer ears), these were placed on dummy heads with microphones inside the \u2018ear canals\u2019 and recordings were made through each of sound coming from a variety of locations. Some of the subjects were audio professionals and some were lay people.\nWhen the subjects listened back to these recordings, there was significant variance in their ability to localize the sound sources. If I remember correctly, they were generally better at listening through their own pinnae than others were, and audio professionals were a bit better at sound localization in general, particularly in the traditional stereo field. However, the really interesting finding was that there were some pinnae that were universally better or worse. People actually had improved localization through someone else\u2019s pinnae than their own, implying that although we are adapted to our own pinnae, there are material differences that make some better than others for localization of sound.\nThis is all from memory of reading something a few months ago, so I apologize if there are details that aren\u2019t 100% accurate, but I assure you that the surprising bit is correct!\n\nHRTF-based binaural mixes are not exactly the same thing as dummy head recordings, but I wonder if, in the creation of the aforementioned \u201cballer individual HRTF\u2019s\u201d there might be a place for some optimization beyond the exact copying of an individual\u2019s unique acoustic properties.",

The first LWMR i ever tuned into i was like, dyauuuummm this guy is really getting riled up about this stuff (in a good way)..lol, its great ...and matt is a real gent and a great host and shepher of the convos......i hope jon keeps doing it and enjoying it ....and again....i really enjoyed your quote ruairi about self being the cause of suffering. this is another core buddhist teaching. ego is the source of all suffering. destroy self destroy suffering. dukkha is self.  From an outside perspective it was also weridly v cool to hear yall had been telling jon how great the 6lack album sounds....i agree...serban couldnt do that . no shade...but he couldnt. im glad jons mixing records in hip hop and r and b . he's keeping the standards up....obviously , you ruairi and spider discussiing this place (the discord) ....your read on it ....as someone giving so much ...and mine as someone receivng so much....is that youre doing a great job man ...its much appreciated.",

It's simply not very high on my list of priorities. I'd say I'm self-centered in how I approach making music. I'm out to make stuff that *I* want to hear. Things that aren't being represented elsewhere. Flavors I've never heard. I'm not aiming for a broad appeal, but I'm also not shying away from it. I'm just not much of a people pleaser in that regard. I'm in it for the discovery and the exploration and the pleasure of making something that excites me.\n\nI think often about that Steve Jobs sentiment of \"People don't know what they want until they see it.\" I think about that a lot. I trust that if I follow what feels good to *me* then I'll get something valuable out of it, and maybe it'll connect with others. If not, that's alright too. I'll know that I've made something that feels great.\n\nI sometimes worry about this because I've always felt that it puts me at odds with a lot of people out here trying to make excellent records. Sometimes our goals will align, but I just don't feel motivated by the need to appeal to a lot of people and that can also make us diverge.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a different kind of taste that I'm trying to cultivate. It's one that runs parallel to the kind of taste that is good at appealing to a large number of people. I feel as if I'm aiming at an entirely different goalpost from people playing the other game. I want to tickle people in a way that they didn't know they were capable of. That's what's thrilling to me.",

I don't work for a big company (I run a small one) but my wife does, and the nice thing here is: you just show up and do YOUR job, you're a nurse and you take care of folks, you're an accountant and you reconcile spreadsheets, etc. Instead we do EVERY job with zero economies of scale, and no matter how much you try to \"outsource\" it, that costs money, it costs oversight and time and initial effort, and in the end it's a lot.",

    "content": "I think the bigger question is the lack of money in recording business. \n\nNo tangible way of making real money off of it for most people except those who are landing sync placements, which can really be anyone. The way I see it is sync placement is fulfilling more of the utility aspect of art, while making records for people to listen to is a more artistic endeavor in service of the people that listen to the records. But the reality is that everyone\u2019s streaming and that doesn\u2019t pay. Even with the biggest success- it won\u2019t make money correspondent to the level of success. \n\nBudget for record production is now more of a PR for their shows or tours. (As far as what I can tell)\n\nSo why in a sane mind would anyone spend money on making it other than for their own satisfaction? It\u2019d be insane to see making records as business investment unless you\u2019re really aiming for sync in mind. But then, what most of us fell in love with are the amazing records that we grew up listening to. Maybe a song from a movie occasionally, but probably not quite a track from sports spot nor a jingle. \n\nAt this point, is there really a way to monetize real money from records other than sync? If there can be, what would that be?",

In restaurant business, you still pay the workers regardless. You have to. In music, if the artist isn\u2019t making money then the ones who get hired by artists have no chance of making money",

    "content": "Alright frens, seeking\u2026 wisdom? Advice? A gig? (Lol.)\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to live in nyc my entire adult life and never have\u2014it\u2019s never made sense to do it career-wise and probably never really will. But every time I\u2019m there I feel totally at home and happy and excited in a way I don\u2019t anywhere else. I spent a summer there several years ago and always linger as long as I can whenever I can, have close friends there (not in music), end up there usually a couple times a year and relish it every time. I feel like I know it as well as is possible for never having been a resident.\n\nI know the music biz there is pretty much defunct (at least compared to LA), and I really *really* don\u2019t want to repeat the emotional and financial ruin that I experienced moving to LA and restarting everything 6 yrs ago\u2026 but from a non-career perspective it\u2019s where I want to be.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m in it to fucking win it in LA for my career\u2014though with an eye for sure on getting to a point where I can relatively comfortably make that move.\n\nAny wisdom/experience on making a mid-career move like this from folks here? I\u2019m 35 yrs old, some decent credits but not major traction yet, in a basically married but not actually married relationship with a school principal who is into the idea of a move there as well (though our finances are totally separate and I for sure need to earn!), no kids or desire/plan to have kids.\n\nAny benchmarks/goals that might be reasonable to aim for before seriously starting to make moves on this? I\u2019d do it tomorrow if I could, but would also stay in LA for 5+ more years no prob to set things up properly. Even open to things like a podcast (/radio?/other audio prod) gig to help smooth the transition if that\u2019s reasonable to find and lucrative enough\u2014but what I\u2019m really looking for is how to think of this as a full time freelance record maker. Or if someone on here secretly is hiring for staff gigs at Electric Lady, plz lmk \ud83d\ude09",

He (reportedly) earned $7 Million from his music in 2013.  So the ROI couldn't profit until 2037 (without touring income).  His fanbase will be effectively extinct by 2040 and it's going to be hard to break 1980s trends on future generations.

We talked about a bunch of stuff but one of the themes we explored was the idea that one needs a \u201cportfolio\u201d of slick & great sounding work to get hired\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided that then it becomes the focus, and changes the way things feel and the way decisions about time, who you work with etc get made. Concepts like \u201cI\u2019ll suck it up and work for free but *then* I will have a singular \u201cgood track\u201d for my portfolio\u201d. Of course there are exceptions but it feels to me that there\u2019s something very constricting and materialist about this way of being in the world. There can be a tension between what the artist wants or what the song wants to be and what makes you look \u201cgood\u201d in your portfolio - they want mono and grimy but you want wide/lush/impressive\n\nIn our jam I proposed a kind of thought experiment, an end of the line or extreme of the \u201cneed portfolio\u201d way of thinking\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say you are here, a young writer, producer, mixer. You\u2019ve been doing it 3 or 4 years. You feel that one of the reasons you are not getting hired, getting shots or getting paid well is that there isn\u2019t a body of work for a potential client to judge you by. Ok, here\u2019s comes the magic trick. I\u2019m going to grant you a genie wish portfolio! 5 killer tracks with  great collaborators. Not hot 100 #1 but the kind of work that you really feel would represent you best in the world. Boom. There it is\u2026\n\nSo now what? You get some DMs and sessions start happening. But you\u2019re not ready. You\u2019re not fit for game day. You\u2019re in over your head, and don\u2019t have the fluency, the experience, the reps and the humblings that build a great music business pro. In short you\u2019re not ready for the opportunities the genie wish portfolio granted you",

We were very close to backing out of the process, until we saw the place we got, and the determining factor for us was that it had an ADU, and was in our budget. There\u2019s work (and money to sink into said work!) we need to do, but once we have a tenant in, even conservatively I think it will either cover our mortgage, or come close to it. (It\u2019s very likely NOT going to cover tax and insurance, but that\u2019s more than fine.) We also were in a really fantastic first time homeowners program, which allowed us to put only 2% down, and gave us a grant for another percentage point down. This is all helped IMMENSELY by my girlfriend both having a real deal grownup salaried job and having just about perfect credit. But it\u2019s going to allow us to build wealth through the house, and allow me to build my studio space, AND if we ever want to leave LA, because our interest rate is comparatively great, we\u2019d just keep it and rent both units.\n\nSo, TLDR, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a slam dunk always great idea, but I think if you can finagle the situation to work for you, it can be really smart.\n\nAlso, my entire family on my mom\u2019s side has been school teachers/librarians/pastors/professors (so doing fine but by no means rich), but my parents and their parents were both able to ride California real estate into a very comfortable place in retirement.",

    "content": "Very interesting question. \n#1 ). I\u2019d lean moreso cutting edge to classic. But I\u2019d give about a 7. I think the cutting edge stuff is what pushes society forward but you need to understand the *why* things were and are the way they are before you can actually begin moving things around. Kind of like coloring outside of the lines, one must first understand why the lines are there and what the lines represent. \n\n#2). I\u2019m a 0 here in the beginning and then branching out in the later. I think it\u2019s smart to become known for something and once you\u2019ve established yourself, then branch out. Personally, I burned myself out trying to be everything to everyone. Trying to solve EVERY problem for every company limited my knowledge to fix niche problems in business thus limiting my income potential. \n\n#3). I go 10 easy. Long term success breeds *predictable* easy wins. I love the quote \u201cit took me 10 years to become an overnight success\u201d. Practicing a shot, riff, sales pitch, etc for years in the long term makes short term wins more sustainable and accessible.",

One of my great joys in life is to pursue the myriad of curiosities that bubble up in me. I would hate to neglect them. Besides there's a lot of cool shit out there.\n\n#3 My default here is a 10. As much as that has been a gift and helped me navigate my career I'm not sure it's best for my wellbeing. My gf is probably closer to a 0 here and she is generally happier than I am and very successful in her career.

Paradox of climbing up to the highest level\nCould Michael Jordan have become Michael Jordan if it wasn\u2019t for the feeling of someone chasing behind him to become one of the greatest of all time? There is only one Michael Jordan, and can anyone else be that one and only without going through what he has put himself through? \n\n2. Acceptance vs Dissatisfaction\nI think the dilemma here is between satisfaction and acceptance vs beating. I don\u2019t think one or the other is necessarily the answer, but I think a good place to be is finding acceptance in where I am right now while still beating on myself to keep on improving to the highest level I could be. \n\n3. Potential\nThis is a crazy concept to me. Who is anyone to evaluate someone\u2019s ceiling of improvement? Spider defined the meaning of \u2018potential\u2019 perfectly in my opinion. Not his exact works but; one\u2019s capable/willing range of adaptation. Did the professor in Whiplash really expand his students\u2019 potential in this sense? \n\n4. Abusive Internal voice \nI love how he saw the professor as our internal voice. And it made perfect sense to why I was so obsessed with this movie and the character. He was myself to me all along. I went back and forth over and over on whether this relationship was worth it to either of them. I think perhaps limited to this particular two people, because they had common goals/interests and made it happen. \n\n5. Joy?\nI feel that this is the most simple and complex out of all things here. Can anyone NOT experience any frustration while trying to get better at something? If the answer is no, is there a way to better manage the frustration? \n\nPursuit vs Result, our brain works the most consistently when we look towards pursuit. Result feels good but not for long, but what if the result meant more than just the goal being achieved? What if the \u201cresult\u201d portion leads to another pursuit after another?",

    "content": "So, first of all, thanks to the buds here who appreciate what I\u2019ve posted in the past.\n\nSecond of all, my thoughts on this:\n \nI have a personal rule that I will NOT post anything that feels like EFFORT or out of a motivation to game the algo. If I\u2019m \u201cmaking content\u201d and notice that I\u2019m doing so out of a place that is less than genuine, I will just delete and move on. \n\nFor me, the \u201cmix tips\u201d thing came out of a sincere place of excitement and passion. I would, as a growing mix engineer, stumble upon something that excited me, and I would find myself wanting to turn around to the people in the room to share\u2026well, there\u2019s almost never anyone in the room with me. So, I channeled that passion and excitement in a genuine way to share with the small community of mixers, mastering engineers and producers that I knew on IG. \n\nAt the beginning of my career on to the middle of my career, that became a very fruitful source of business for me - people who followed me on IG, who enjoyed my posts, and began to view me as someone who MIGHT know a thing or two about mixing. \n\nAs my career has developed and my clientele has growing, that has become less important, but it was absolutely pivotal in helping me build a deep bench of great clients, both indie and signed. \n\nBut\u2026I NEVER did it for that reason. It was always (and continues to be) a genuine result of my passion for what I do.",

I see a lot of people successfully doing media planning (release scheduling etc) with ChatGPT now - that seems to be one of the areas where AI can do a pretty stellar job, but you'd still need someone to look over/execute.\n\nOverall it sounds like you might need someone with a pretty broad skillset. I'd look at an ex youtuber/part time youtuber in your position probably, but few of them have the technical chops to make lyric videos or film acoustic videos to a high standard - I'd suggest those are two different roles, unless you get very lucky. The cinematography and lyric video making (motion graphics) are also considered more high paying skillsets, so even if you do find someone with the entire range of skills, you might end up paying more than splitting them up.\n\nOverall your plan sounds good! Sounds great that you're willing to be hands off, that will pay immensely in my experience. \n\nRe: meetings, I don't really have an approach apart from avoiding them as much as possible. Try to schedule group calls when it's possible to multitask. What kind of meetings do you have with your team now?",

    "content": "the word \u201cemotion\u201d needs a better definition sometimes in the space we are in. \n\nEmotion isn\u2019t necessarily something that you are always aware of \u201cfeeling\u201d. Some reactions are merely state of mind, until it is given a name. Some reactions are visceral because of what the chemicals do to our body. \nsometimes, it\u2019s neither visceral nor label-able. Which makes us assume that it\u2019s not a feeling or emotion. But can we really differentiate emotions and thoughts? What exactly would differentiate them? \n\nOn the other hand, there is music that pushes more, versus music that pulls more. \n\nJust like how audio is bipolar, we can\u2019t have connections just be a one way communication. Tame Impala is a type of music that pulls. You don\u2019t know why, but you just want to know \u201cwhat was that song? I GOTS TO FIND OUT\u201d. \n\nPush is more like\u2026 \u201cI can\u2019t unhear it\u201d a lot of Pop hits are push with some pull factor. \n\nthe ones that make you bummed out that you couldn\u2019t shazam are ones that pull you in. it\u2019s a slight push that gets you listening, and the rest of it is just pulling you in. (my own reaction when I first heard tame impala and couldn\u2019t find out whose song it was)\n\nCulturally, I think the love for (dreamy sound) can be explained with a desire to escape reality. \n\nSo really, the emotional reaction is that \u201cit transports me into a different space\u201d. My theory on \u201cwhy do people like that feeling?\u201d is that many people aren\u2019t happy with the reality of our lives because of economy and what not. And the idea of \u201cescape from reality\u201d became more and more a viable thing for us to want after experiencing digital devices and internet.",

To become the most whole version of themselves, imho. \n\nYour job as a producer is to create a safe and encouraging space where they can explore and express it, say scary things, move forward in their ideas. It\u2019s also your job to then facilitate the process at every stage, musically and otherwise, to make sure the execution is as good as it can possibly be.

Sometimes we're in the studio with very specific goals in mind. For example: to sound like the the musical equivalent of the artist's Pinterest board, to sound like two of the artist's favorite artists had a baby together, to sound like the last album but different, or just to make our own version of an already-established style of music. On the other hand, sometimes we're searching and digging and discovering to see what happens. In these production sessions it may seem like there are no goal posts -- the goal is there but it's just not readily apparent. Maybe the artist doesn't seem like they even know what they want but they do and they'll know it when they hear it. And then once (if) you get to that aha! moment, it's like hitting something hard when digging for treasure in the sand. Maybe it's just a rock, or maybe it's coprolite or maybe, just maybe it's a chest full of gold coins which you can then hand over to the labels, managers, lawyers and streaming services while you keep a couple of the remaining fragments of copper for yourself.",

He said some of the most hateful and egregious shit I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. Directed towards me. And then he forgets what he said and why. I know it\u2019s not the same thing.  But my dad also went years without getting the proper help he needs. Now he\u2019s a lot better. \n\nI know it\u2019s not the same thing, but I know manic when I see it. I also place blame in the people around him. Cause I\u2019m sure they make money off of him being off his meds.",

    "content": "Hey everyone, I'm pondering the idea of moving my studio out of my apt into a proper space. If you're in LA, what are some places that you have leased private lockouts/studios at? I've only come across Lemon Tree and had a friend at the lockouts at Kingsize. \n\nAnd then also a big question for anybody who's moved their set up out of their homes: Have you seen the ROI on moving your space out of your home/apt? I like the idea of moving my studio out because of the ability to have an artist/client come over without them being in my personal space. It wasn't that big of a deal to me when I was living alone and younger, but now that I'm getting a little older and living with my girlfriend, I grow less fond of the idea of people coming over to work. And if you did move out, did having that professional middle ground increase your business? \n\nI've never leased a studio before, but just a thought as life is moving along and I think I'll be able to lease a place! So, just wanted to see everyone's experience with this life and career move!",

    "content": "I think there\u2019s a danger in assuming those that are successful didn\u2019t have it hard.\n2 quick stories that have shaped my career:\n\nvery early on when I was recruited to play in a band in Australia. Sold my car, got rid of my apartment, and flew out to Melbourne. Band had a moment but I got tossed out just as the song was going number 1. Had no money to get home, no where to stay, and was literally 23 living on our producers couch in a country about as far from home as possible. And I called my pop, basically telling him how bummed/scared/fucked I was. And he goes \u201cyou know, I just got off the phone with **** (a very famous actor friend of ours). If there\u2019s anyone that had it all, you\u2019d think it was him. Big career, wife on the cover of sports illustrated swimsuit edition, fans everywhere. But it turns out his Dad just passed, his wife is cheating on him, and if this new show doesn\u2019t get picked up they might lose the house they just bought. EVERYONE has their share of crap they have to deal with, give or take, no matter how easy it looks from the outside. Life isn\u2019t about what happens to you, it\u2019s about how you deal with what happens to you. Figure out a way to make the most of what\u2019s going on\u201d. For some reason, knowing that EVERYONE\u2019s life sucks to some degree, was immensely helpful in getting me back on my feet.\n\nThe other was a year or two later, when I started tuning vocals for Rob Cavallo. One of his wrecking crew of session musicians had been in a band with a huge hero of mine, who had sadly took his own life mid way through making his second record. I asked the guy if there was anything he could tell me about working with said hero, and he said \u201che was the best musician I\u2019ve ever met. Whatever instrument you played he was better at it than you were within 10 minutes of picking it up. But he seemed to think he was the only guy that ever got a raw deal from the music industry\u201d.",

    "content": "I like the idea of agency as practice. A really talented artist I've been working with recently is young and very new to the industry. They don't know much about being a recording artist, how publishing works, how the business side of things goes down, or what kind of a team they need to build around themselves etc. So I suggested some further reading, shared some of my experience and gave them some tips (as I always try to do with younger artists, to do what you say @spectrummasters and support them). Their response was 'Honestly my manager can do all of this for me, I just want to focus on the music, it's all too complicated and goes over my head'.\n\nSo what can you do \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nThis, I guess, is one example of someone who could really do with some personal agency. If their manager walks, they're a bit fucked. There are thousands of other young artists out there who will be actively educating themselves on the business, joining Discord groups like this for furthering their networks and education, and proactively looking at how the arc of their career can be navigated 'by them', not 'to them'. This kind of proactive attitude would immediately gift the artist I'm working with a leg-up, giving them an advantage over peers, with a higher chance of success. The more they do this, the more control they have over their career. It's a win-win.\n\nSo back to a more definition-based view of the term 'agency', or like I said before 'nous', a lot of folks could do with more of it and I totally see both sides of this conversation. It's good to explore the cultural and societal effects on something like this as nothing exists in a vacuum, but on a general, everyday level, it's SUPER useful and important to try and exercise control over outcomes. Is the opposite of agency apathy?",

I see AI and social media driving out fair weather \u201cmusical creators \u201c and leaving behind only those who do it cause they have to , not because they \u201ccan \u201c . So the less people can make a living out of making music the more I see music returning to the hands of true , passionate artists . When you can\u2019t afford to do it \u2026..but you can\u2019t stop . That\u2019s the art that\u2019s important . I think we are moving there",

I have around 15 years of experience but I've had long dry spells of doing next to nothing while focusing on my career (and partying and wasting time in my 20's). The realization of how much I fucking love producing and mixing has hit me as part of my mid life crisis and I'm ready to do something about it. I want experience and I think I have something to offer. ISO: artists who would be willing to give me a try or just let me practice with their stuff. Willing to work for free, especially if I'm excited/passionate about the project. Also open to just practicing with peoples stems that have already been worked. Advice/ideas of where to go, welcome. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc super excited to be part of this group so thanks again for the warm welcome and great energy. After many hours of listening to the podcast... I'd expect nothing less.",

    "content": "Hey guys, so I wear a lot of different hats in my day to day, as I'm sure a lot of you do. Does anyone else experience a kind of uncertainty/mild anxiety about their work that might derive from the fact that you're not really specialized in a certain area? I feel like I'm not always as excited or confident about getting into a certain task not only because I know i'm not very good at it yet (which i know is all relative, I could still be exactly what someone else needs for something), but also because I know others are out there, sometimes in my personal circle, who are much better? For a little added detail, my fulltime career is as a voice actor, but I love mixing, and sometimes I produce some baby artists, engineer ADR and video game/commercial voiceover. This week i was asked to dialog edit an animated film, I have to comp vocals for someone's song, and there's always a litany of othere stuff, none of which I ever feel prepared to do so the work usually takes longer than I know it should. Maybe the answer is simply to stop trying to be everything to everyone, but honestly I'm terrified to put all my eggs into the voiceover basket even though it's what I've got the most momentum with.",

Where music became a sought after profession. As a writer, artist or a band. Post Cheiron and the international web, Zuckerberg etc. I don't doubt people nowadays have a very strong passion for music, but that it becoming a profession is an early motivator and goal?  Again, my feeling but when you aspire to do something in the realm of profession, brain trumps heart.",
