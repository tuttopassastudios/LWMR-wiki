Did you catch it?\n\nIf not, which channel did he post it in? The hell if *I* know! Luckily we no longer have to trawl the Discord logs to locate it. His entire essay is now being hosted on the newly minted *Resources* section of the LWMR website.\n\nIn the coming weeks we\u2019ll be filling this section in with some of the very best posts and nuggets of wisdom that have come through the LWMR server so far. No more brilliant posts lost forever in the torrent of people talking about Topping DACs or asking for a collab channel. Today we\u2019re laying the foundations so that future generations might someday know how to make their 808s go *brrrrrrr*.\n\nhttps://www.livewithmattrad.com/resources",

    "content": "Today I got a reminder of how important love and care are in what we do. Just wanna give a shoutout to @Nomograph Mastering for all the wisdom shared here on that topic.\n\nLong story short \u2014 I agreed to mix a track for an American rapper who had already been turned down by some A-list mixers, even though the guy had a decent budget. The reason was kinda obvious: he\u2019s got a personality that leans toward OCD, with everything that comes with that \u2014 defensive tone in convos, super long mix notes, and weird stuff like thinking a file sounds different just because it was renamed. (I forgot to label one file as \u201cref. limited\u201d like the previous versions, and even though it was literally the exact same file, he swore the \u201cnon-limited\u201d one had a different top end.)\n\nStuff like that made me seriously consider walking away from the project like the others did \u2014 I could just feel the back-and-forth drama coming. But after my first instinct, I remembered a lot of what\u2019s been talked about here: love, care, and being open to the music and the art. So I decided to try empathy instead of just being a jerk out of frustration.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. After taking a bit of time to really talk to him and show I genuinely wanted to help \u2014 not just as a mixer, but as a human \u2014 I learned he\u2019s totally burnt out and running on fumes 'cause he just became a dad. And I totally get that, since my first kid was born a month ago too. That connection shifted the whole vibe. The next round of notes actually made sense, and we ended up approving the first mix by version 4 \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad at all. Happy client, job done.\n\nNot saying you should hang onto toxic clients, but it was a solid reminder: don\u2019t always go with your first reaction. Sometimes just showing a little care  about the person on the other side can change everything. It did for me this time. And tbh, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve handled it this way if I hadn\u2019t read some of the stuff shared here. So thanks, y\u2019all. This place is gold.",

    "content": "Re; Brauer workshop\n\n-First 2 days were nothing technical, the 1st conversation he brought up was about TM and how meditation in general has helped him.\n-Everything is feel-based, most technical Q's for the first 2 and a half days got the same reply: \"It doesn't matter to me, i don't care what the thing is long as it feels good\". \n-MHB actually seems to leave the planet while he's mixing, it's wild how immediate he gets into that space. Seemed to go way past \"i love mixing and here's all the reasons i'm the shit\" and it was inspiring to see the ego leave the equation. His decades of experience are playing directly into his ability to access the story of the song and present it in a compelling, live-feeling way. He mixes from inside the song and performs. Well, he does discovery, then shapes the sounds, then performs just about everything on faders.\n-The biggest wake up call to me is that a lot of moves i've made on mixes did not have a good reason behind them. So continuing to ask \"why\" as I work is gonna be important, because I have to start catching myself and adjusting when the answer to \"why\" is \"because someone said this preset is cool\" or \"because this is what I do to a vocal/guitar/drums\". I feel music very deeply, it's why i got into this, but I feel like i've been poisoned against trusting that instinct and convinced that what we do is a technical job. I'm done being an observer of the art, i want to be bold.\n-It's critical to build trust with clients right away, you can't assume anything in what they understand about how you feel. Telling them you love the song and you're excited to mix it is important, and never blaming production/artist/anything else for the mix being less than what it should be. never okay to say \"i did my best\", because that gives you an out and implies somebody else could do it better\n-Therefore, you must believe when you sit down to mix that nobody is gonna interpret this song better than you.\n-Generally i'm skeptical to just take on someone else's \"method\" and start operating in that space just becuase of the success they've had with it. Putting this week into practice is going to mean using his template to get reps in, listening and feeling and interacting in a new way and letting my brain \"level up\", if you will, then zooming out and making it my own.\n\n\nI can distill this more and want to share about a couple other specifics, but I just realized I grabbed someone else's notebook by mistake when I left on the last day so I'll need to have them mail mine back to me.",

    "content": "Hey folks, back from mix with the masters with Jon & Teezio. I wanted to share just a little bit in case anyone else here is considering attending a workshop in the future. I was initially on the fence, but am very glad I went. \n\nJon & Teezio were amazing together. I don't know how often MWTM does workshops with two engineers, but it really enriched the experience for me. It was actually comical how different their perspectives were on mixing, the business side, motivation for the work, lifestyle, etc... This created fascinating debate / conversation in the group. The Grammy nominations were announced while we were all together and we got to celebrate Jon & Teezio as a group for their I think combined 6 or 7 nominations. They brought in a bucket of champaign. All this after having gone through the sessions for said grammy nominated work earlier in the week. 10 / 10.\n\nRue Boyer studios is actually insane. Probably the best room I've been in.\n\nThere were attendees from all over the world. We ended up sharing mixes and receiving feedback from J&T. Hearing and sharing records in the same room with the people who made them with context provided from varying countries, cultures, genres, and scenes was as enlightening a music listening experience as I'm likely to have for the rest of my life.\n\nSo if anyone else here is on the fence in the future. Here's a tiny nudge.",

    "content": "sort of related, but i've been reflecting a lot on how precious it is to maintain a listener's perspective on a work in progress, and what things we can be doing as the producer/mixer/etc to grant that privilege to the artist first and foremost. the simple stuff includes saving the nitty gritty work for your own time, delivering the best mix of the record no matter the stage it's in, focusing any time spent together on how you can make their voice and contributions and ideas the best they can be. some artists love mixing and editing and getting into the weeds, but i'm realizing quite often how much of a duty it is to be the artist, and how record making is only a single slice of that pie. For us it is more or less the whole pie. and a big responsibility we carry (perhaps without realizing?) is that it is our job to protect the artist from getting  stressed out by the process. and this extends to processing and managing our own stress about the work should it exist, as stress is a contagious energy.",

If that were the case me and a lot of the folks here would be complete losers, but we\u2019re not. We\u2019re actually better for having worked on things that we\u2019d never share willingly.\nIs this really a reason to bail? I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t. But aesthetics are really subjective. Are you saying your finger\u2019s on the pulse of your generation\u2019s aesthetic taste? Is there room for differences? Also, it sounds like your friend wrote the songs and is the frontman, and you are producing, playing bass, and mixing. Why are you so attached to the visual aspect of it when your role is more support rather than the face of the project?",

Having only experienced studio work as a cottage industry up to that point, PP opened my eyes to avenues I could pursue that I wouldn\u2019t have known even existed otherwise (recording engineer is different to mixing engineer is different to producer is different to songwriter??!). It all seems very rudimentary now, but I was starting from literally nothing in a place with few (if any?) visible role models.\n\nI learned so much from it on a technical level - from basic stuff like what a Pultec is and how people use it (connecting the dots between my cracked Waves bundle - Puigtec and who tf JJP was), what \u201ca vocal chain\u201d might look like and the purpose of each stage\u2026\n\nTrue, the interviews did become unbearable, but there was a golden era between eps around 30-90 at a time when outside of working in the studio world, there weren\u2019t many other sources of good information from people who were really doing it.\n\nHuge appreciation for Dave, and I hope he and his family get the support they need.",

    "content": "In the midst of a kinda unique side quest at the moment - label pulls me in at an hourly rate with an artist (and good friend) that I\u2019ve mixed for many times because the production sessions were such a mess that they felt like they couldn\u2019t even finish the records until some light mixing and organization took place. Songs spread out between multiple project files, DAWs, laptops\u2026vocals tracked to mp3s with the ~50ms delay thing\u2026Some of these producers templates\u2026brilliant stuff. Saw one vocal travel through maybe 7 or 8 auxes and hit probably 4 different rvox\u2019s along the way. It was like a labyrinth of signal flow that was nearly impossible to follow (and once I deleted half the auxes and waves plugins, it started to come back to life). In short they\u2019re having me un-mix it, hand it back for some more production, then do the final mixes later this year. A true testament to the importance of organization and more importantly minimalist, straight forward session files. I wonder how often this need comes up and how feasible it is to be involved ahead of the handoff as a mixer these days. And before you frown at me for griping, this is an absolutely incredible project, many insanely talented musicians I respect. Very right brained, free flowing group. So it felt cool to be able to play more of a part on the project as the more left brained participant and see the stress relief happen in real time.",

On mixing the Rage Renegades album with Rick Rubin: \n\n\"Rick called me up after I worked on Fiona Apple \"When The Pawn..\". I learned a lot from him, primarily how to work from instinct instead of intellect. He would often make mix suggestions which I thought were bad ideas but I would of course do them because it's what he wanted, and they worked. He really did listen like a teenager, it was always simply whether or not he was getting off on something. If he wasn't, he'd make very clear suggestions on how to make something better. Sometimes he'd just say the mix sucked and to start over (only once). Sometimes the recording itself had issues and he would just deal with what's there. I think that turned into a serious strength of his- working with what's in front of him. We still keep in touch from time to time\"",

    "content": "Awesome. I'm seeing this right now with a friend's band, so ima jump on the bandwagon here. I just took over mixing the album, which has been in progress for years. Everybody tells me the producer/band leader is this prolific asshole, constantly blowing up at people and impossible to please. The previous mixer had been mixing this thing for months/over a year and everyone was worn out/not getting results. I was really reluctant to take on the project for fear of being intimidated/failing to deliver.\n\nI've made a point of greeting the producer at every step with clear communication, enthusiasm, and an open mind. I genuinely love the music and have made a point of letting him know how much fun it's been to work on the stuff. And, similar to your story, we were basically approved on the first track within 4 mixes and the guy seemed really really happy.\n\nEveryone just said this guy was a hopeless asshole, but what I saw was a guy who was working so hard to bring a vision to life and just struggling to get there; self-financing, overseeing everything, etc... and it's fairly complex, hip hop and soul vibes with practically a full orchestra and 3 vocalists, so it's a lot to manage. Not trying to excuse the asshole behavior, but I see the frustration and I really wanted to highlight how much cool work he had done and that, without any fuss or needless back and forth, we would just get it where it needed to go. i tried to just think about how exciting it could be to finally hear these songs that've been bouncing around in his head actually come out of the speaker the way he imagined. We've got 7 songs almost done now and I've grown so much just from these attitude alignments i've picked up from spending time here.",

    "content": "Many songs come out of the mixing stage sounding \"done.\" Those songs could still benefit from perspective. I would not describe that as \"a lot of the mastering processes happening in the mixing stage.\" For me, mastering is the process by which I 100% align the final product with the artistic intent. There's a technical component to that, but there's also a huge component of that that is pure vibe. Can I enhance the feeling of this song without getting in the way? Is the feeling of this song fully realized? Is the feeling of these songs together fully realized? Uncovering all that to me is the job. Sometimes it's already there and there's very little, if anything, to do. The perspective is still valuable. The key here is somebody who both understands the technical aspects of the job as well as somebody who can internalize and FEEL the music. The latter is why I believe mastering is one of the most misunderstood processes.",

    "content": "I'm totally with you on all this.\n\nThe question for me is less about the credit/ title, and more about the role. How do you get perspective at the end of the record making process? This role is changing, and we'd all be smart to understand where it's headed.\n\nI get hired to finish songs a lot. Usually that means I have a \"co-producer\" credit. Sometimes it means \"mixer\" credit. Occasionally it's included \"mastering.\" But really what I'm hired for is that combination of experience and technical knowledge. I'm an outside ear who knows how to fix what's missing. This role of \"finisher\" is really where a lot of the producer/ mixer/ mastering engineer profession is headed. The distinction between those roles is getting blurrier. \n\nMixing engineers have moved from pulling up faders on the console and creating a mix (old school \"mixers\") to often just pulling up the rough mix of stems and making finishing touches (Jon, Manny, Serban, Tony, Bainz, etc.).\n\nIn this way, the \"mixing engineer\" profession is moving away from manipulating raw sounds to manipulating nearly finished mixes. This is sounding more and more like what a \"mastering engineer\" does. Now there's \"stem mixing\" and \"stem mastering\" too, further blurring the lines. These are all just slightly different configurations of the same thing. Who do you hire to get perspective and then act on it?\n\nThose of us that are finishers or mixers or mastering engineers or whatever would be smart to think about how to adapt to the direction this is all headed. \n\nI want us all to win. I think we need to step back and expand how we think about the roles. It's the best way for us all to have careers.",

Into the coaxial cable that runs into the center console, for that true old analog gold plated warmth. Turned the windows and volume all the way up, then as I prepared to hit play. I was blanketed with the all to familar tension. That very same feeling from when I was going to have to sit next to one of the two dudes on the middle school basketball team. Who took as their daily task, to pay homage to ancestral animal social structures, by drowning any nearby male counter part with sack taps, donkey punches, and nail whip flicks. You just preemptively flinch at the inevitable pain from their onslaught. I hit play on a mix that is -5.8 lufs at peak. No proverbial donkey punch to my thighs this time. The song didn't overload the speakers at any point. As I heard the mix in my studio. I heard it here. The things I loved about it. I loved it here. The things I was unsure about. I was equally unsure about them here. My eyes welled up a bit with fulfillment and gratitude. It took me longer and cost more than I could of ever imagined, when I started this journey. But I got here. No longer do I have to worry about translation of the mix. I can focus all my worry on the feeling and vibe of the performace. I'm willing to let my ego have this one, this mix punches with any modern mix on earth. On any system. (Sounds killer on the Meta Ray Bans. And those speakers are rutheless honest. Ive heard alot of overloaded low end mixes on em) And back to the gratitude. I wanted to thank this place. I couldn't have done it without yall. I'd still be in a pitch black room looking for a switch that felt like it was hidden on the ceiling. Now back to work! Have a great day yall!!",

There\u2019s a camaraderie and kinship in physical labour on construction projects, and an embodied intelligence in that world that offsets the subjective and (for me) atomised work of hours alone mixing.\n\nWhen I\u2019m doing construction work, I\u2019m also free to think objectively and from a distance about my audio engineering work.\n\nMost of all, something changes for me when I\u2019m being paid for musical \u201cwork\u201d that I\u2019m not entirely happy with. I\u2019ve discussed this privately with a few folks here, and it seems the relationship between music and its commodification is problematic for more than a few of us. Simply put, it\u2019s sometimes less enjoyable \u2014 though equally amazing \u2014 being paid for a passion.\n\nI couldn\u2019t recommend a construction or skilled trade career enough. It\u2019s incredibly flexible and offers a tonic to music careers: you know you can walk onto a site tomorrow and get paid quickly and well. It\u2019s always going to be around, and in my case, the certifications allow me to consider migrating to most economies globally as a skilled worker.\n\nConstruction allows me to be my own patron for my musical endeavours, and that feels really good.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a bigger debate here about how working in the upper echelons of the music industry feels long term \u2014 challenges, payoffs, economics, job security, retirement, healthcare, family life versus work life, and a world where socialising is networking.\n\nConstruction is a simpler engagement: competency, find a solution, do the work, go home.\n\nI came across @cian riordan discussing becoming a fireman on Conversations, and much of what you said, Cian, is exactly what I get from construction.\n\nI love how for you, though \u2014 instead of the firehouse bell calling, it was multiple Grammys!",

It took me about a year to pull in enough income from mixing and spotify streams where I could stop living off savings and only on music income. \n\nBut, It IS so expensive to live here, and I like to do things. typical night out is like $80 after drinks and ubers. Gas is $80. An egg sandwich is $16 lol. The constant worrying of if i was going to make enough that month got to me, so of a couple months ago, I returned to a freelance software engineering gig 3 days a week. Never been happier. A _lot_ of people in LA are doing the same: _side hustles are your friend_ . \n\nAnother thing i'd add is when you first move here, try to combine your studio and living expenses. Studio spots here start at like $1800 a month and go up from there. I live in a beautiful house in silverlake with roommates where I have a room, my own bathroom, _and my own studio_ in the furnished garage for $1300. Try to get something like that.",

Recording took us 7 days and they still needed to add synths and bass fot some of the songs after that (side note: the production wasn't finished by the time we tracked, so I edited everything I had - 10 songs, none of them with less than 5 minutes. It was the band's first time in the studio, also, and had to edit lots of drums and bass stuff). After doing a first pass, I sent them the multitracks they asked for, to track the rest of their stuff with their producer (a colleague of mine). The next 8 months were spent waiting on their files to start mixing (this was supposed to last 1/2 months, max). When I finally got the files, you have no ideia how messy the project turned out (track names, bounce mistakes, ultrapocessed tracks with artifacts - even the ones we've tracked at the studio before, audible edit points,... all you can imagine going wrong at this point), so it took me a bunch of time to organize everything in a way that I could work with what I've got (going back and forth asking the producer for some files that didn't even get to me or asking if there was the possibility to get some of the tracks dry, without processing or fx - keep this in mind).\n\nNeedless to say, when I was ready to start mixing, I was already overwhelmed and tired of it, and I knew I still had a long way to go...\n\nFirst version took me probably too long to get right (2 months, approx., working on other projects that got scheduled on those 8 months) and I've sent it before I went on a few days vacation.",

    "content": "Nail on the head. I think I had mentioned this in a previous post, but these days notes tend to come in real time -- via text messages, dropbox comments, or sometimes even thoughtful emails. I'll usually take a quick glance, but then dump everything into a note file so I have everything in one place when I sit to do the revision. This can be useful when you'll get a thread of notes like 1) I'm not sure about the drum sound, it feel so x... then 2) someone else will chime in saying I love the drums! I think x is the problem then 3) first person is hesitant and shrugs of their not, even though it may still bother them. That way I can try and string together some sort of move that will hopefully make everyone happy. If you're dealing with a band -- and you're producing/engineering -- you'll have had the benefit of seeing the dynamic. Sometimes you get some people that are more engaged and tweaky, others that are unsure of EVERYTHING, and then people that when they say something, they're usually right, as infrequent as that may be. This is very useful during mix notes time because you have context. If you're just getting flies flown to you and you've never met the band/artist, thats certainly a bit more of a challenge and will likely require more work on your end to smooth things out.",

He\u2019d mix 2 songs a day on average, and just breeze through cranking on the 550 eqs in the console\u2014not a care in the world what the numbers said. I\u2019d take recall notes and print stems/various mixes and he and the band would go have lunch/dinner. Seeing him repeatedly just crank on shit until it sounded compelling was huge. Obviously, you need to have developed the instincts to do that tastefully and have it sound great, but that sent me down a path of being fearless and trying to not get hung up on looking at shit.",

As somebody's who's been at this crossroads (mixing & mastering vs. one or the other), I realized that to do one or the other the way I wanted to and do it right, I'd have to commit to one. And each of those paths imply different studio set ups and ergonomics and mindsets. I had 2 paths, you have 3. That\u2019s a lot to ask of 1 space IMO. I don\u2019t know how I could pull all of those disciplines off in the same space without feeling like I\u2019m making a compromise somewhere. Tracking and mixing seem most compatible from a \"one space\" perspective. I bet focusing on tracking and mixing will be a relief and pay dividends for you. Your knowledge having done mastering before will be an asset to you in the tracking and mixing phase and make your end product even better.",

About 3 years ago it clicked that mastering is my thing and decided to spend the last few years dialing in my rig and room around mastering. The job has been able to subsidize what has turned into a parallel career. I have designs on having this be my full time gig at some point, but I'm taking it slow, honing my craft and building my client base and studio while the steady paycheck is there. It's nice to be able to do that without grinding to make ends meet. I realize that is a privileged position to be in so I am grateful. With COVID, I can also crank out masters while I WFH when there's downtime or I need a work break. Some weeks are harder than others from a workload standpoint, but mastering is part of my brain-therapy so I'm happy to take it all on.",

When I send back the revision, i will put my notes in bold/color next to their notes... usually explaining what I did in vague detail. If it was a note like you're referring to above where I don't really agree with it, I'll make the adjustment best I can, say that I don't agree with it, but here it is anyways. If it's something I feel really strongly about -- I'll still execute, but be a little more forceful in my language saying something like 'I really don't think this is a good idea, but hear it anyways'. You want the band to know that you're open to feedback but that you also have skin in the game and care about the end product.

I\u2019m still working mixing full time as well. I do production if I\u2019m stoked on the project. I work with rock bands for context. Just do dope work try not to compare. Remember there are some people with mountains of gear and dope setups they own. much respect to that. Others have rich parents, high interest credit debt, or both. I told myself if I wasn\u2019t rolling in it with a Grammy at 30 I would stop which is a super dumb mindset.

This weekend im mixing for the first time away from my studio and with family. it feels cool. \n\nI know why i do music, because i have to......the time i give to mixing and serving the whims of the client ....this is something im examining more closely now. And that feels wise. Life moves fast, i dont want to spend a huge chunk of it in a fashion that isnt who i am.....screen-based and inside",

Really interesting stuff, and @BatMeckley made me start thinking about it more with his comment about guitar gear. We as a collective grow and evolve over time and go through cycles but there are fundamentals that still remain true. We want to capture the emotion and represent something that will best suit the song. Different production and mixing styles help accomplish that but it\u2019s cool to see how things change over time.

It probably hits harder because my dad is around the same age and has Parkinson\u2019s it's not the same but\u2026 \n Dave always seemed like a genuinely good person, and I\u2019m grateful for how he tried to spread knowledge.\n\nI\u2019m with Cian on the interview quality \u2014 a lot of them were just awkward (the Justin Meldal-Johnsen one is a perfect example), and the absolute worst part was Herb. In the end, his stupid ego kinda killed the show. It was really annoying how he kept interrupting all the time and talking way more than Dave or the guest, about random shit that had nothing to do with the conversation. Fucking terrible.\n\nBUT I can\u2019t forget that back in the day, Pensado\u2019s Place was one of the very few places where you could actually see your mixing heroes talk about making records. Even when the interviews were pretty bad like 85% of the time, I still had great moments watching Eric Valentine, Tchad Blake, JMJ, Ken Andrews, etc\u2026 and I learned some useful stuff too.\n\nI\u2019m from a small village in Northwest Spain (BTW, I heard Pensado has family roots here), and I had zero access to any info about how real records were made. So when I discovered Pensado\u2019s Place, it was huge for me. Big thanks to Dave!! And I wish him nothing but the best in this sad new chapter. Good people and love for this art will always win for me, no matter the flaws. \u2764\ufe0f",

Which option is best I\u2019d say depends on your relationship with them, how much of a lead you want to take creatively, how confident you are in making the right choices for this song, etc. etc.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @cian riordan might have better advise for these situations!",

To your point on here ruari, about spoiling the feel in pursuit of the sonics, Pink Floyds remastered stuff feels like a completely different vibe. Theres a real lesson happening for me here about ruining a mix by being too clever.... before i dive into mixing some bits ove got to do....in many moments the drums' scrappier sound (IMO) of Yachty's el seminole feel better than the floyd remastered stuff (particularly Wish You Were Here / The Wall) . Thankfully my fav floyd album (Animals ) has still got an unremastered version up but overall i think these remasters are making your point for you ruari",

They clearly confuse frequency response with quality, like someone that thinks a harsh bright mic sounds \u201cbetter\u201d.\n\nAndy Wallace is brilliant and his records sound incredible, more importantly FEEL incredible, because he\u2019s constantly mixing the song, constantly making decisions. Like a shit hot live band playing off each other Andy\u2019s faders are always moving, parts are constantly responding to other parts, decisions are being made about sonic and part priorities.\n\nI think one of the main reasons when i asked the round table what their favorite mixes were, almost no modern mixes (last 5-10 years or so) came up.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard concept for me to verbalize, but I think we have a lot of people focused on the wrong thing and misunderstanding WHY mixes resonated, and now they\u2019re all chasing the wrong thing. Like my thoughts on if you asked a berklee student who the best guitarist was they\u2019d pick some shredder, because they think technical wizardry is the benchmark, when the people whose playing makes you FEEL something tend to go way farther.\n\nEnough mixers think that a clean 26hz and a saturated 26k is what the goal of a mix is and you end up with a bunch of songs that are really clear but really boring and uninspiring.",

In some cases, even the intended audience. with that said, if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. \n\n/ might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it. \n\nso who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. \n\nthis is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world. but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

Forget about the record you're working on for as long as you can afford to, listen to great music of a similar genre, that really inspires you, and come back to it. Usually when I do that I'm flooding with inspiration and ideas when I come back. That's just my experience anyway!! Could be helpful for you",

It doesn\u2019t always work but sometimes people just say stuff to say stuff, and they may listen to the mix several times again and get used to how it is and not even want the change later or remember they said anything. I know that may sound insulting but I just dealt with this exact thing, and that did save me a few times. If they brought it up again I tried to meet in the middle. I started experimenting with this once I realized being super honest/straight forward/transparent can actually slow down the process without any benefit. This may apply to more commercial productions where people don\u2019t really want a \u201cno\u201d or a \u201cwhy not\u201d they just want a yes man and a person to get the job done.

I was very lucky to have subbed in for @cian riordan with St. Vincent for a couple months in the early stages of this new record\u2014nothing was documented (unless I grabbed a quick photo to cover my own ass), it was all just trying stuff, and if it worked it worked, if not, move on and forget it! Mixing is another story\u2014in the (increasingly) rare instance when I'm mixing on a console, I'll figure out some way of recalling for that particular project. This is usually more or less @Rollmottle's method, except I go even more jank-ass and just scribble song names on a post-it and hold it in front of a piece of gear like a mugshot. Anything on the console is either stored in the console automation, or, like the most recent project I mixed on a console, I'll just calibrate all the faders and run stuff through it, but really *mix* in Pro Tools still. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Wondering what tools and habits people are using for medium to long term planning and vision casting, for lack of a better term, especially when busy?\n\nHad what I would consider my first really busy year as a producer last year. Worked on 75 songs, most of them full instrumental productions taking them from a demo, playing / recording everything, and often mixing. It was a really exciting year but I found I spent most of the time being reactive, rather than proactive, just trying to stay on top of getting things out the door on time! \n\nWhat do y'all do to make sure you get time thinking about what you'd like to see happen in your career (everything from people you want to work with, music you want to create, gear you want to purchase), and organize it in an actionable way so that your time spent making stuff for other people also takes you where you want to go long-term?

That has encouraged me, revisiting mentally, when I lose a project or a project isn\u2019t a good fit.\n\nSpecifically, he talked about working with Sheryl Crow and doing some mixes. Sheryl and her team went in a different direction. Months later, Sheryl came back to Tchad saying she was wrong about his mixes initially and finished the project with him.",

We can go outside and listen to a band in a room and hear reflections all around us. But there is a chance to go deeper with spatial audio, to create something hyper-real, as much of record making has always been. Every new technology has the opportunity to enhance or detract from our experiences, and we have to meet them where they are. Maybe Atmos ain't it, but as someone who spends a lot of time in surround.. there is a feeling to immersing yourself in sound that isn't going to come from two speakers. So yes.. mixing in Atmos can very much be a part of steering the ship.",

If you're recording/mixing/producing, do it as best as you can. That can mean passing it on to someone else (and handle this part with care, in my opinion, is also a part of the job). But if you end up going all the way, it still is a worthy project, you should still give it 100% of yourself. Learn something new and useful. And if you do, you should be proud of having your name on something you know you gave your best (even if the rest of it wasn't ideal, your part was the best you could do, at least in a certain moment in time).\n\nSo, I'm all for: work in it, own it.

For instance, I love love love Jaime by Brittany Howard, and Shawn is phenomenal (AND if shit sounds great who cares what the LUFS meter says), but it is loud as hell.

Is there someone mastering right now who is just boldly NOT slamming a limiter and letting things breathe more? Do we care?\n\nI ask partly because, like I think many people, I incorporate a limiter on my mix bus to get things loud and be mixing \u201cinto\u201d a mastering chain, and this has led me down a bit of a rabbit hole.",

I currently have a separate production/writing template and then another for mixing but I\u2019m trying to hybridise and streamline them a little more to get faster results and hopefully focus on the song. Also, most of the songs I mix tend to be one\u2019s I\u2019ve written and produced as well, so hoping to cut down on session set-up time.\n\nSome of mine are an instant \u201cduck bus\u201d, which I picked up from Ian Kirkpatrick. It\u2019s a pre-loaded aux with something like LFO Tool or shaper box on it, so you can quickly route and uniformly make things side chain.\n\nAnother quick workflow thing I love is having Pro Tools audio playlists with a bunch of reverse sweeps, impacts and other transition fx/ear candy hidden and ready to go in the session, so you can quickly try out a bunch. \n\nI also have the trim plugin added as the first and last plugin on every new track preset, as I use them to quickly manage the gain in and out of each track and so I don\u2019t have to search for them constantly.\n\nOzone Spectral shaper on some music busses and as a replacement for Soothe on the mix bus has also been a real win (thanks Jon!) Although these sorta things aren\u2019t turned on whilst writing as they have a ton of latency.\n\nKeen to hear what you all find useful!",

Not always the case, but it is sometimes for me, and if I knew more about why, I may be able to prevent it happening in the future.\n\nWhat you guys think? Anyone get a similar experience?",

    "content": "Do you have any way of recording at home? You mention \"while you are not actually recording\". The best way to practice is to literally do it as often as possible even if it's by yourself. You won't train the social aspect, you won't really train problem solving of an external source (a guitarist with a particularly shitty amp or playing technique per-say), but you can certainly experiment endlessly on capturing sounds. Shootouts, micing techinques, it's pretty much endless. If you don't have a recording setup at home or are in an apartment where you can't be as loud as you'd want, I try to absorb as much information as I can. Podcasts (Andrew Talks to Awesome People / Unstoppable Recording Machine / Working Class Audio / Conversations Audio), Online articles, (Sound on Sound) GearSpace Forum Q+A, TapeOp interviews, Youtube Series (Making Records with EV, Sounds-Like-a-Drum), etc. These can be incredibly inspiring and keep your mind tuned into the recording process.  I sort of use this as my \"fix\" when I am not able to work actively on a project. Otherwise, what everyone else has said about mixing are perfect suggestions. Maybe set limitations like only using plugins you haven't used. or remove a plugin you are constantly using to force yourself out of a habit. Practice editing dramatically even if the track doesn't call for it so you can get your editing chops up.",

Just the other day when i was mixing a demo track i recorded, I made myself use stock plugins for about 80% of it cause I still had a lot of production work to do but it could use some cleaning. Honestly, the mix sounded just as good (if not better) and my production work went over better because latency wasn\u2019t an issue and I didn\u2019t have to worry about committing.",

I'm interested as a recording/mixing engineer rather than as an artist, I'd like to be able to give melody ideas to artists and sometimes add backing vocals. Are there any good youtube channels / books / exercises to train every day with you guys know of ?",

Ran on a ton of mixing sessions and helped his guy out tho in that time...  the main assisting gig was a band called thousand foot krutch. I think maybe also a day or two on five finger death punch? I dont have it written down tho so not sure. Just digging back into my iCal now... the last long session i ran on before that was nickleback dark horse.. was like a month+ i think? I remember one day getting a fax from Mutt and it was just the song lyrics and little up and down arrows to show what vocal rides he wanted on like a bunch of words/parts of words and phrases lol. Brutal. No recall sheets, not mine to share!",

The first LWMR i ever tuned into i was like, dyauuuummm this guy is really getting riled up about this stuff (in a good way)..lol, its great ...and matt is a real gent and a great host and shepher of the convos......i hope jon keeps doing it and enjoying it ....and again....i really enjoyed your quote ruairi about self being the cause of suffering. this is another core buddhist teaching. ego is the source of all suffering. destroy self destroy suffering. dukkha is self.  From an outside perspective it was also weridly v cool to hear yall had been telling jon how great the 6lack album sounds....i agree...serban couldnt do that . no shade...but he couldnt. im glad jons mixing records in hip hop and r and b . he's keeping the standards up....obviously , you ruairi and spider discussiing this place (the discord) ....your read on it ....as someone giving so much ...and mine as someone receivng so much....is that youre doing a great job man ...its much appreciated.",

If I\u2019m \u201cmaking content\u201d and notice that I\u2019m doing so out of a place that is less than genuine, I will just delete and move on. \n\nFor me, the \u201cmix tips\u201d thing came out of a sincere place of excitement and passion. I would, as a growing mix engineer, stumble upon something that excited me, and I would find myself wanting to turn around to the people in the room to share\u2026well, there\u2019s almost never anyone in the room with me. So, I channeled that passion and excitement in a genuine way to share with the small community of mixers, mastering engineers and producers that I knew on IG. \n\nAt the beginning of my career on to the middle of my career, that became a very fruitful source of business for me - people who followed me on IG, who enjoyed my posts, and began to view me as someone who MIGHT know a thing or two about mixing. \n\nAs my career has developed and my clientele has growing, that has become less important, but it was absolutely pivotal in helping me build a deep bench of great clients, both indie and signed. \n\nBut\u2026I NEVER did it for that reason. It was always (and continues to be) a genuine result of my passion for what I do.",

No need to run a billion instances of serum or anything like that but I do have a lot of plugins running most of the time and it\u2019d be nice not to feel like my computers about to blow up.

I\u2019m interested if anyone here has a particular vision about how one can compensate for or say goodbye to that specific aspect of sound (the feel ) and how useful it is in record making . I think of drums and bass particularly in terms of the frequency ranges and how the transients feel on my ears / chest / belly etc for the different parts.

As one day , the artist will perform it live . I come from club and sound system culture , so the ultimate destination is a wall of speaker boxes \u2026..and in the end music has to be re inforced for public performance .

I have around 15 years of experience but I've had long dry spells of doing next to nothing while focusing on my career (and partying and wasting time in my 20's). The realization of how much I fucking love producing and mixing has hit me as part of my mid life crisis and I'm ready to do something about it. I want experience and I think I have something to offer. ISO: artists who would be willing to give me a try or just let me practice with their stuff. Willing to work for free, especially if I'm excited/passionate about the project. Also open to just practicing with peoples stems that have already been worked. Advice/ideas of where to go, welcome. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc super excited to be part of this group so thanks again for the warm welcome and great energy. After many hours of listening to the podcast... I'd expect nothing less.",

For a little added detail, my fulltime career is as a voice actor, but I love mixing, and sometimes I produce some baby artists, engineer ADR and video game/commercial voiceover. This week i was asked to dialog edit an animated film, I have to comp vocals for someone's song, and there's always a litany of othere stuff, none of which I ever feel prepared to do so the work usually takes longer than I know it should. Maybe the answer is simply to stop trying to be everything to everyone, but honestly I'm terrified to put all my eggs into the voiceover basket even though it's what I've got the most momentum with.",
