It's no overstatement to say that you *are* this server and the reason for it's success.\n\nWe've got a very special community that's been built up over our short history and this place would fall apart if each and every one of us wasn't maintaining the level of excellence, understanding, kindness, and great discourse that this place is known for. We've got something special here.\n\nI love to see how welcoming you all are whenever we get someone new and how helpful we are at answering the questions of people at every stage of their journey. Hats off to the collective \"we\" and to the individuals who make this place great.\n\nAnd finally, thank you to @oaklandmatt for creating such a place. Thank you for everything that you've made here and for giving us a place to thrive and come to know one another.",

Just wanted to say how much I appreciate this community and attest to the quality of conversation here.\n\nI put in my resignation notice at the day job today, and will be transitioning to music full-time in May. I genuinely don\u2019t believe I could have done it without this place. You all challenge me in the best ways, and have helped me grow tremendously as a person and a professional.\n\nI still don\u2019t have it all sorted out, and I\u2019m still fervently pursuing mentorship in any form I can find, but for now the work is paying the bills; something I thought I\u2019d never be able to say.\n\nThank you all for being generous with your hard-earned wisdom. It really does make a difference.\n\n(Sorry, got a bit sappy there \ud83d\ude05)",

    "content": "Ok Long Post alert, but touches on a few things we harp on around here. \n\nSo my little bro is in town- we made dinner for one of his oldest friends who just moved to town with his wife. He\u2019s a fantastic mandolin player and his wife is a singer/songwriter. \n\nOf course I did the ol\u2019 studio walk through, listening to all the tunes on the ear calibration playlist, then let them play some of their own favs. Of course they\u2019re blown away and have never heard music like this etc. \n\nBut to drive the point home I show them a song @Rollmottle and I turned around in just over 24 hours. \u201cThe reason for the speakers & treatment etc is so we can make decisions quickly blah blah blah.\u201d  I pull up the session and we listen through and they\u2019re loving it- but I\u2019m noticing it doesn\u2019t have the 3D thing that all the other music we\u2019ve been listening to has. \n\nThen I show them the mastered version. An mp3. It\u2019s louder and better sounding and all, until the first BGV stack hits\u2026 then it\u2019s IMMERSIVE. We listened to the whole thing again just to enjoy the magic and notice all the ways the master improved it. So far beyond zapping resonances and making it loud, @Rollmottle made it sound\u2026 important. Made *me* sound like a good mixer. \n\nIt was heavier lifting for him cause I didn\u2019t have the benefit of time for fresh ears or to detail the vocal the way I normally would. Also had the good fortune of having @Ross Fortune on speed dial and on GMT to give it a listen at 5am PST. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re curious, or dubious, I\u2019ll DM files so you can hear what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nTL;DR: monitoring matters, fresh perspective matters. Don\u2019t produce mix *and* master your own shit.",

    "content": "\u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d - Ira Glass",

    "content": "Re; Brauer workshop\n\n-First 2 days were nothing technical, the 1st conversation he brought up was about TM and how meditation in general has helped him.\n-Everything is feel-based, most technical Q's for the first 2 and a half days got the same reply: \"It doesn't matter to me, i don't care what the thing is long as it feels good\". \n-MHB actually seems to leave the planet while he's mixing, it's wild how immediate he gets into that space. Seemed to go way past \"i love mixing and here's all the reasons i'm the shit\" and it was inspiring to see the ego leave the equation. His decades of experience are playing directly into his ability to access the story of the song and present it in a compelling, live-feeling way. He mixes from inside the song and performs. Well, he does discovery, then shapes the sounds, then performs just about everything on faders.\n-The biggest wake up call to me is that a lot of moves i've made on mixes did not have a good reason behind them. So continuing to ask \"why\" as I work is gonna be important, because I have to start catching myself and adjusting when the answer to \"why\" is \"because someone said this preset is cool\" or \"because this is what I do to a vocal/guitar/drums\". I feel music very deeply, it's why i got into this, but I feel like i've been poisoned against trusting that instinct and convinced that what we do is a technical job. I'm done being an observer of the art, i want to be bold.\n-It's critical to build trust with clients right away, you can't assume anything in what they understand about how you feel. Telling them you love the song and you're excited to mix it is important, and never blaming production/artist/anything else for the mix being less than what it should be. never okay to say \"i did my best\", because that gives you an out and implies somebody else could do it better\n-Therefore, you must believe when you sit down to mix that nobody is gonna interpret this song better than you.\n-Generally i'm skeptical to just take on someone else's \"method\" and start operating in that space just becuase of the success they've had with it. Putting this week into practice is going to mean using his template to get reps in, listening and feeling and interacting in a new way and letting my brain \"level up\", if you will, then zooming out and making it my own.\n\n\nI can distill this more and want to share about a couple other specifics, but I just realized I grabbed someone else's notebook by mistake when I left on the last day so I'll need to have them mail mine back to me.",

    "content": "I've had certain partners that are easier to deal with than others with this kind of thing for sure, and being with someone who actually understands these things really helps, but at the end of the day no one wants to be with someone who's grinding 100% of the time. There's more to life than that, and whats the point of being in a relationship if you never see the other person. I also get the working in music/freelance lifestyle, and sometimes its hard to even want to do fun things outside of it when you're so focused on this thing that really excites you that also is your livelyhood.\n\nIts such a hard thing to get right and in my experience with certain partners, its been an ongoing arguement, even in the past when i've had salary jobs and a very predictable schedule. So i'm not sure it goes away by making your life more regimented. I think the only answer here is being super open and radically honest about everything. \n\nIn my experience, letting your partner know when you've been asked to do something before you've agreed to it, makes them feel like they're a part of the thought process behind the work and less like they're just observing you living your life from the outside. Even if you were always gonna say yes to it anyway, at least they feel like they have some control and are on the same team as you. IME you just gotta go out of your way to make them feel like they're doing it all with you. They feel closer to you in a situation where they could just as easily feel like they're being pushed away. I'm not sure what way you've went about it, thats just my experience. If you're living with your partner you kinda have to see yourselves as the same person working toward the same thing, as opposed to two individuals with their own lives.\n\nAlso going out of your way to be spontaneous and do something fun and/or stupid like you're teenagers when things arent as busy goes a long way when things are.",

I thought commiserating about shitty aspects of a gig was a part of professionalism, but they have me rethinking things. \n\nIn my own projects, when I approach clients with patience and curiosity, I find that not only are they happier faster, I\u2019m happier the whole time. It\u2019s SO MUCH EASIER to say \u201clet\u2019s try it\u201d than to say \u201chere\u2019s why that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d I find I learn a lot that way too. \n\nIn any case, going back in to fix or add only bugs me when I think I\u2019m supposed to be done.

He and his wife sing together and are getting back into it. \n\nHe\u2019s got a vintage 67 and 269 in pristine condition, is mostly doing audio for movies now so he\u2019s stepped out of tech work and will only send his mics to Germany to get worked on. \n\nThat\u2019s all preamble for this part of the story. \n\nHe recently did a shootout on pres & compressors for his home setup. Ended up selling his vintage Neve & La2a in favor of the ORIGINAL MBOX. The first iteration that had Focusrite pres I guess? Had to buy old laptops to run ProTools 8. Has 3 rigs at his place and got \u2018em all for under a $100. \n\nBoys & Girls, Vintage Digital is officially en vogue.",

It was a weird box but had some amazingly responsive presets in it, nestled between random shred tones. It was awesome but I never made much music on it, and it ended up in my closet bc it was too bulky to live on my studio floor. I have to admit I felt jealous when this mk.gee wave hit and I saw 2 vg8s on the stage. I was sitting on a goldmine but I didn\u2019t use it enough and they got there first! Been playing baritones for a long time too, fingerstyle. The lesson for me in this is that no matter what sounds are available to me, I need to be constantly re-connecting to my Why.

The stakes for errors have gone up - when they are manufacturing 100k copies of vinyl then you have to be sure it\u2019s error free\n\n**Do you reject artists if they approach you to \u201cMaster my album i\u2019ll pay you whatever you want\u201d if you think the level of their sound might not honour your history with all these artists**\n\nI don\u2019t reject *anyone* who can pay my rate. I don\u2019t vet clients on a \u201chow will you make me look?\u201d basis, I\u2019m a service provider to them. There are very very occasionally mismatches where I\u2019ll say \u201chappy to do this but I think you\u2019d be better served by XYZ\u201d, an example being someone coming to me with EDM who wants really intense processing - another girl or guy steeped in that genre will serve them better\n\n**How does it feel having a connection to these artists?**\n\nIt feels really nice to be trusted with people\u2019s art, when someone like a St. Vincent says \u201cyeah, this is good\u201d it matters to me, she has great ears and taste so it feels good to hit a mark\n\nIt\u2019s also very special to hear these things come out of the speaker for the first time - I\u2019ll never forget hearing Nick Cave, or Taylor or Lana in the room for the first time. It\u2019s a privilege to be trusted with their art\n\n**but does it ever happen that you are wanting more?\u201d**\n\nI\u2019m human and can be reliably trusted to do all the silly human things like being greedy, insecure, fearful etc. but every year I get a little better at living a better way, and around the music in particular my operating principles \u201cThe why\u201d feel better and truer than they ever have",

    "content": "I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner, but the closest parallel to the seismic shift of AI might be samples, even more so than things like digital recording or Pro Tools. When Hans Zimmer recorded an orchestra and started writing music with a DAW and showing clients mockups, nothing was ever the same. For a long time (even now!) the pencil-and-paper people griped about how it wasn't real composition. Orchestras feared that they would all be replaced by computers. But ultimately, everyone had to come to terms with the new world order and adapt. There was a period in the mid-90s through mid-late 2000s where orchestral writing was reduced to nothing more than long notes and short notes. All of the nuance was gone, because the tech couldn't handle it yet and people blamed the tech. Many mourned the loss of true orchestral writing, yearning for a by-gone era. \n\nBut eventually, people learned to harness these new tools and they met the technology on its own terms. People are doing wildly innovative things with samples now, we've moved completely past the era of \"can I make a convincing clarinet come out of my keyboard?\" Orchestras and live musicians have not been replaced. Sure, the process is different than it used to be, but that's how innovations work. All of us would be living very different lives without samples of drums, guitars, orchestras, synths, etc. There will be a generation coming up where AI is already a thing, they won't have ever lived in the before-times. Just like those here who've never cut to tape. It's okay.",

This role is changing, and we'd all be smart to understand where it's headed.\n\nI get hired to finish songs a lot. Usually that means I have a \"co-producer\" credit. Sometimes it means \"mixer\" credit. Occasionally it's included \"mastering.\" But really what I'm hired for is that combination of experience and technical knowledge. I'm an outside ear who knows how to fix what's missing. This role of \"finisher\" is really where a lot of the producer/ mixer/ mastering engineer profession is headed. The distinction between those roles is getting blurrier. \n\nMixing engineers have moved from pulling up faders on the console and creating a mix (old school \"mixers\") to often just pulling up the rough mix of stems and making finishing touches (Jon, Manny, Serban, Tony, Bainz, etc.).\n\nIn this way, the \"mixing engineer\" profession is moving away from manipulating raw sounds to manipulating nearly finished mixes. This is sounding more and more like what a \"mastering engineer\" does. Now there's \"stem mixing\" and \"stem mastering\" too, further blurring the lines. These are all just slightly different configurations of the same thing. Who do you hire to get perspective and then act on it?\n\nThose of us that are finishers or mixers or mastering engineers or whatever would be smart to think about how to adapt to the direction this is all headed. \n\nI want us all to win. I think we need to step back and expand how we think about the roles. It's the best way for us all to have careers.",

I've thought about this a lot lately - the idea that things outside myself happening randomly might result in something beautiful, non-2nd-law, that there's a future for my kids. Been struggling with the death of a very close friend for the last 6 months, and I (for some reason, I'm not going to defend or explain it) started reading the works of Rene Gerard, the mimetic desire philosopher (\"Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind\" etc.) Previously I had read more stoic philosophy and resonated with that. Historically I come from a Christian perspective, though never bought into evangelicalism even as a kid.\n\nSo, something very bad happened, and it rocked me harder than anything has in a long time. Spoke at my friend's memorial, told part of his life story, and wept with hundreds of people. Didn't end for me there, though. Became very... depressed is probably the wrong term. Nihilistic is closer, but also wrong. Maybe just \"not hopeful\".\n\nDon't really have a logical conclusion for this, like I usually try to have, except to say: I still believe in beautiful things, people, experiences. Coffee while my kids chat with me in the morning. Sitting on the porch watching the sun rise earlier. And I do believe that all manner of things will be well in the end, and I choose to relax that tense knot inside myself, and I choose to move forward, and grow or decline, and move forward with as much grace as I can muster. I don't surf, and I find the overuse of the analogy annoying, but yes, to surf through the ups and downs instead of trying to master the waves.",

Hacking it out in real time. Trusting myself.\n\nSensuality was about connecting with my body and my senses. Savoring things. Observing them. Feeling things deeply and being present in my body.\n\nFor each theme I usually come up with a big list of situations, activities, opportunities, and practices that I intend to pursue whenever the present themselves. And then I do them! \n\nThey're also things to contemplate: What does this mean to me? What does it mean to others? How does it influence my life?",

They took a much more targeted approach to soaking up low end by building limp mass absorbers. Instead of the more broadband approach of the tube traps, these required measuring the room pre-treatment and figuring out what the problem areas were. Then, these absorbers are manufactured to specific problem frequencies in the room. I was a little skeptical at first but man, the low end in here is just absolutely magic. I've never been in a room where I can walk around and the low end stays so even throughout. The downside to these absorbers is that they are tailor made to fix the flaws in my specific room, so if I ever move, they'd likely be useless somewhere else. That's the real benefit of tube traps is the ability to move them around from studio to studio, and even to different places within the studio to address various problems.",

Cutting edge in creative pursuits, but classics in my personal taste.

When you actually release a piece of work it is now out there to be consumed, enjoyed, criticized, evaluated. It\u2019s so much easier to just have this amorphous concept of an in progress piece of work, because it can be as grand and as loved as you can imagine in your head.",

This was mainly as a staff engineer at a big studio, which is its own hustle, but if you can look for something to learn/improve/gain on each project, I don't think every single session needs to be the most artistically/personally satisfying thing. Then you have this wealth of experience to take into the sessions that do really matter. You're sharpening your tools everyday if you can land a situation like that\u2014AND if it's aligned with what you ultimately want to do.",

    "content": "So I climbed into my 2010 Volvo S80 today. And for the first time in 2025. I was going to listen to my music on the speakers. I plugged in my usb c adapter. Into the coaxial cable that runs into the center console, for that true old analog gold plated warmth. Turned the windows and volume all the way up, then as I prepared to hit play. I was blanketed with the all to familar tension. That very same feeling from when I was going to have to sit next to one of the two dudes on the middle school basketball team. Who took as their daily task, to pay homage to ancestral animal social structures, by drowning any nearby male counter part with sack taps, donkey punches, and nail whip flicks. You just preemptively flinch at the inevitable pain from their onslaught. I hit play on a mix that is -5.8 lufs at peak. No proverbial donkey punch to my thighs this time. The song didn't overload the speakers at any point. As I heard the mix in my studio. I heard it here. The things I loved about it. I loved it here. The things I was unsure about. I was equally unsure about them here. My eyes welled up a bit with fulfillment and gratitude. It took me longer and cost more than I could of ever imagined, when I started this journey. But I got here. No longer do I have to worry about translation of the mix. I can focus all my worry on the feeling and vibe of the performace. I'm willing to let my ego have this one, this mix punches with any modern mix on earth. On any system. (Sounds killer on the Meta Ray Bans. And those speakers are rutheless honest. Ive heard alot of overloaded low end mixes on em) And back to the gratitude. I wanted to thank this place. I couldn't have done it without yall. I'd still be in a pitch black room looking for a switch that felt like it was hidden on the ceiling. Now back to work! Have a great day yall!!",

    "content": "On this note, I'll say that I LOVE these drives. My workflow in the past has basically been to buy a new 1GB SSD drive every few projects. When I had my setup on a laptop, this allowed me to always have access to projects I was working on the go (printing stems on the couch while watching TV? Yes please). In addition to using these SSDs, I'd always keep local backups with 'Sync Folders Pro' -- RIP Sync X -- on a cheaper, larger capacity USB drive. Being an anxious data archiver, I also signed up for Backblaze a few years ago as a cloud solution in case my studio burns down. Its a really great service, but the caveat they have with your drives is you *can* back up externals, they just need to be connected to your computer every 30 days. So I bought this monster USB3 hub and just had all of these fucking SSDs connected to my computer whenever it was setup at my studio. It worked fine for a few years, but I ran out of space again a few weeks ago and decided to futureproof mysetup a little bit. I ended up getting a thunderbolt Drobo. That way, I could have redundant storage for archived projects (which also gets uploaded to backblaze) but without having 16 drives on my desktop. Now I just have two of those samsung SSDs -- one work, and one as a backup. They run lightning fast and I get to keep having local backups in case I fuck the dog moving files around after a few glasses of wine. Then, when I run out of space, I just offload onto the Drobo and it's locally redundant, and also backed up on the cloud. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",

The most intuitive, most empathetic, most knowledgeable (in ____), etc\n\nI don\u2019t really know what smart means, but people that appear smart are very nuanced about the things they don\u2019t know or understand. They can articulate what they know, they can put things together with intuition, they can develop ideas and concepts without being fed one.\n\nMy observations of people with great wisdom seem to be the people who spend great deal of time processing emotions and self reflection. And they share what they learn from the place of empathy. \n\nI had a guitar teacher, he never gave me \u201creal answers\u201d to my questions. He always told me at the end of his version of guidance and helpful tools or some joke (again not an answer)\u201cyou\u2019ll find the answers to any questions inside you\u201d.

(This pair has better bass, we\u2019ll give them to the bass player. These are open back we\u2019ll give them to the horn section so they can blend better) The very next session without having to mention it, she had placed the same headphones in the same places AND ALSO she then took that info and made a the judgement that we\u2019d give the nicest most comfy pair to the vocalist.

The vocals that got recorded on tour were fine but far from ideal. \n\nYou will be better served by treating your individual room, rather than trying to make a small booth-type thing. Vocals tend to sound uneven in the low mids when you record them in a small space. \n\nAs @cian riordan said, lots of good info that is searchable on this discord about how to treat your room.",

It took me about a year to pull in enough income from mixing and spotify streams where I could stop living off savings and only on music income. \n\nBut, It IS so expensive to live here, and I like to do things. typical night out is like $80 after drinks and ubers. Gas is $80. An egg sandwich is $16 lol. The constant worrying of if i was going to make enough that month got to me, so of a couple months ago, I returned to a freelance software engineering gig 3 days a week. Never been happier. A _lot_ of people in LA are doing the same: _side hustles are your friend_ . \n\nAnother thing i'd add is when you first move here, try to combine your studio and living expenses. Studio spots here start at like $1800 a month and go up from there. I live in a beautiful house in silverlake with roommates where I have a room, my own bathroom, _and my own studio_ in the furnished garage for $1300. Try to get something like that.",

After uni I\u2019d do stage management/engineer assisting  at local venues in bristol volunterrring just to get experience......i did the wailers, ozomatli, pharcyde.....tons of two tone ska....while volunteering in dj workshops for local kids.....and up to today i always do some free stuff for rappers and singers in my area...because (and this is where i think mainstream often misunderstand rap lyrics).....it helps youngers express themselves and get shit off their chest....and off the streets.....and focuses their minds on ambition and change. In this way i think music is about grace....and as you said @BatMeckley  ...magic. What it brings into peoples lives and how it affects lives. The money i can take it or leave it....but the music i have to have. The most enriching musical experiences i can look back on have nothing to do with how much money was transacted",

I think I had mentioned this in a previous post, but these days notes tend to come in real time -- via text messages, dropbox comments, or sometimes even thoughtful emails. I'll usually take a quick glance, but then dump everything into a note file so I have everything in one place when I sit to do the revision. This can be useful when you'll get a thread of notes like 1) I'm not sure about the drum sound, it feel so x... then 2) someone else will chime in saying I love the drums! I think x is the problem then 3) first person is hesitant and shrugs of their not, even though it may still bother them. That way I can try and string together some sort of move that will hopefully make everyone happy. If you're dealing with a band -- and you're producing/engineering -- you'll have had the benefit of seeing the dynamic. Sometimes you get some people that are more engaged and tweaky, others that are unsure of EVERYTHING, and then people that when they say something, they're usually right, as infrequent as that may be. This is very useful during mix notes time because you have context. If you're just getting flies flown to you and you've never met the band/artist, thats certainly a bit more of a challenge and will likely require more work on your end to smooth things out.",

I know this is really simple stuff but If you make a habit of these things and stay consistent, you'll notice drastic improvements in physical and mental health, and you won't ever feel like exercise is a chore.\n\nIf there's one topic that I actually know a lot about, even down to a deep scientific level, it'd be this sorta stuff, so feel free to hmu with any qs whenever lol",

Many people working in audio have never even seen such a machine. They are complicated - there are techs who work on consoles who won\u2019t touch cutting lathes. IMO the best lathes were made by Neumann in the 70s/early 80s, and that was a long time ago. You have a TON of electronics and mechanics that need to be refurbished / restored to get the lathe to make some great cuts. Some engineers are cutting on some nicely restored systems and some are using some OLD stuff which should have been pulled for maintenance decades ago. Imagine if 50% of the records today were mastered on 50 year old loudspeakers with blown drivers and mismatched crossovers. We might notice.",

Anytime I haven't done that the project runs long, the client gets burned out, the client goes to someone else I know then I have to listen to them/see them complain about their new headache.

It is VERY difficult to teach self determination to people who don\u2019t inherently believe that taking direct action toward a goal makes things start to happen. A lot of people don't believe it can be that simple. This doesn't mean it's easy. It can be hard to overcome one\u2019s wiring and circumstances. And sometimes people need to learn the hard way. But, outside of the extreme, everybody\u2019s got the agency to make their desired outcomes happen. Some need to work at it harder than others. For some, it comes easier. And sadly some never realize that their outcomes are in their hands.

But his setup was just incredibly different than mine; he uses Studio One, I use pro tools (he\u2019s also used to Pro tools and recently bailed on it). He\u2019s using a combo of Antelope Discrete 8 and an Audient ASP880 and some good outboard pres (Vintech and Summit audio). His monitoring killed me, some small dynaudios which sounded okay and some ProAc\u2019s. He had some decent mics. I brought my 8 Channels of UTA and a bunch of mics and was there just to put our heads together, and I was going mostly press record so he could drum for his bands record.\n\nAnyway, we spent about 4+ hours trouble shooting Studio One, his computer, and the interfaces -eventually finding out one of his AD/DA channels was so messed up it sounded like a ribbon mic when it was a condenser. A lot of his mic stands and cables were really junky - he didn\u2019t have enough of the basics on his own.\n\nSo many things were just not working as I would expect - my UTA preamps were set at much lower gains than I do at my studio because of his gear. I\u2019m basically ear-blind because of the monitoring, even with headphones, and I\u2019m working in Studio One so I can barely focus on the sound. And he used a normal Apple mouse, I use a trackball. \n\nIm trying not to complain, but it just blew my mind how much of an uphill battle recording can be just because of simple things being so taxing. We spent about an hour of the 6 hours I was there tracking one song. The rest was setup. It made me realize why we put so much work into making our process simple and getting gear that is effective and reliable.",

One of my best strats is a made in Mexico cheapy, but I had to literally play all 14 the store had and one was clearly better. I\u2019ve had new Taylors shipped out on the road to me and they\u2019ve always been sea worthy right out of the box. None have ever been quite as magic as my old man\u2019s mahogany Martin, but none have been as awful as my Martin. That\u2019s kinda what I meant by the prs comparison. You can order one sight unseen and I can almost guarantee it\u2019ll do what it\u2019s supposed to do. Almost never a 10, but never a 6 either. Always right around 7-9 if that makes any sense.",

    "content": "I actually *just* posted this in a #\ud83c\udf9bgear-talk convo, but I'll elaborate in more detail:\n\nI set annual themes for myself.  This year is the *Year of Intuition and Sensuality*.\n\nThe *intuition* aspect means that whenever an opportunity arises to do something I will challenge myself to dive right in and intuitively feel my way through it, rather than taking an overhead approach and charting everything out before I act. Don't second-guess. Just go for it.\n\nI'm exceedingly good at planning and analysis, but I'm less comfortable with simply diving headfirst into something, getting messy, and figuring it out as I go. So this year is about me identifying opportunities to do so and hack away without premeditation (I've already got that in spades). Throw myself in and then dig myself out. It's a muscle I want to flex so that I can be more ambidextrous in my approach to situations.\n\nThe *sensuality* half is about being more in touch with my body. It's less about health or fitness and more about observing my body and following the sensations. Being more sensual. Whether it's exploring feelings of touch, scent, or flavor. Being attuned to how my body feels when I sing. Or how an instrument through an amp resonates in my body. Following those instincts. Dancing more. Anything that might fall under that umbrella.",

I'm still listening to records every day - same as ever - but my approach has been to set the creation part aside completely and focus on the physical pleasures of playing.\n\nFor me that means focusing on singing for the first time in my life. Really taking the time to feel the physicality of it and how my body responds. Honing in on the sound and loosening up. I'm also playing more bass and focusing on the sensations and the tone and the articulation in a way that I've neglected for a while. Now I'm enjoying playing and singing together and practicing that with no expectations. I say this as someone who has never considered themselves to be a singer/songwriter. I'm really enjoying it.\n\nThe whole project is tied in with my mindfulness practice, and I'm loving the feeling of being unburdened by the need to write and deliver.",

My job is about realizing someone else's vision and pushing that to be the best it can be. If you're being hired as a producer, then like me, you have to believe that you're being hired for your taste and perspective. So the question is, why doesn't it feel good to you? Is there something undiscovered that could make it better?\n\nI've written a lot of music that's outside of my aesthetic or personal tastes. But if I'm on the project, I'm going to be 100% invested in helping make that thing what it needs to be. There's a way into music that's outside of your vibe - sometimes it's getting excited about new techniques, sometimes it's exploring a genre you're unfamiliar with, and sometimes it's just because the people you're making music with are a good hang. Sometimes, the role of a composer (or producer) is to take their vision and find the version of it that **does **get you excited. We've probably all had that experience of \"I really never listen to X, but this one song/artist is just undeniable.\" So strive for that.",

First of all, great record / artist. I checked out his Spotify and saw that he had no music out before this album. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but my understanding is that he got some tik tok traction then went on the road with Zach Bryan before any of his stuff was out? Was so stoked to see the amount of excitement around an artist\u2019s first release (which is so sick that his first release was an album as well). This might be a hot take, but I think I\u2019m a pretty big fan of the way tik tok has impacted music discovery. Obviously it\u2019s not perfect or going to satisfy everyone, but it\u2019s pretty awesome that all the doors are wide open. And I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a bigger interest in songs, writing, lyrics, etc. From what I\u2019ve heard, it sounds like people got to know some of these Joshua Slone songs well enough to be singing along at his live shows, and I would dare to attribute that to the fact that his lyrics are literally on the screen in his videos. Who knows, maybe that\u2019s all bull shit lol, but wanted to throw it out there. Would love to hear y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts.",

    "content": "My main tip for using Live live is try and replace as many third party plugins as you possibly can with stock, freeze as much as you can, and most of the latency you experience is going to be coming from internal delay compensation vs I/O latency.  If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

    "content": "Yes. The same way you do anything in life you want to get good at. Spend a shit load of time doing that thing. There really are no hacks or work arounds if you want to actually get good. An easy free way to do it is just learn as many songs as you can. If you want to really be proficient in the musical language I would recommend learning stuff by ear. It takes a lot longer than looking up tutorials or sheet music. But I promise you will develop your ears infinitely more. Specially in the beginning. Music is a language. Every human being learns to speak and converse before they learn how to spell and know the rules of grammar. Learning theory will only let you put names to sounds so that you can convey musical ideas to their people. Contrary to what a lot of people think, there are no rules, but there are a lot of conventions and traditions, but they keep changing and have lots of exceptions. Learning a shit ton of songs on whatever instrument you choose, will teach you what those conventions are and how to use them. \n\nIn the beginning it\u2019s good to just learn every song you like as well as you can, because it will help keep you motivated as you like the music. Then after a while you will probably want to branch out and try stuff you\u2019ve never listened to or enjoyed before just to challenge yourself. \n\nThe most musical people I know, are the people who wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a Caugmented#9 but can listen to a song once and play it nearly perfectly, because their ears and musical language is so developed from playing a fuck lot of music and not spending time reading about it or watching endless tutorials.",

E.g. \"Today we're going to record ourselves speaking\" - briefly introduce how a microphone works, what a preamp is, and then get them recording each other. Same with EQ, Compressor, Reverb, Delay, etc.\n\n- Use as many examples from current pop music as possible. Does someone in the class sing or rap? Have the students go through assembling a vocal chain with a compressor, EQ, etc. and record part of a song.\n\n- Don't get too far in the weeds where it's not necessary. High schoolers DO need to know why we have different sample rates and bit depths. They DON'T need to know about aliasing, oversampling, clocking, or dither algorithms.\n\n- Bring history in for context, but don't dwell on it. It's cool to know that we used to need a speaker in an echoey room or a giant metal plate to make a reverb, but focus on how and why they're using effects rather than where they came from",

I begged him to teach me Hey Joe, and so he played me the opening riff, full speed, and then stared at me with a deadpan bloodshot eyed stoner look. \nI asked to do it again and then again then to break it down in to smaller increments until he stopped, looked at me and said \u201cyou will never be as good at guitar as me.\u201d \n\nThat was a defining moment for me.

They did indeed do that, and I don\u2019t think it will go back. \n\nIt was decentralization they were after. the record industry was already beyond rescue (to go back to its heyday) so they wanted a better piratesbay where people can hear the music right away, and not the messed up mp3 that has been converted to different codecs multiple times. The platforms opening up to everybody is why someone like myself or my clients can upload any kind of music. \n\nI mention all of this to say\u2026 I think that\u2019s what they wanted. But I think they were hoping more people would use the free version so they can juice more profit out of the ads. I don\u2019t think they were expecting this many people to go premium, which lowers the value of each ads\u2026 (because they won\u2019t be listened to as much)",

I've also heard Orchids are on this difficult list. The company cool though and offered to replace it free of charge, so now we have a money tree and it's fantastic. Looks really cool and is thriving. We're fairly organized with our plant collection so I have a long list I can share, but I'd suggest a syngonium, fiddle leaf, philodendron, or monstera.

    "content": "If you\u2019re confident enough to hit various scales spanning 2+ octaves in each hand (in sync and delayed/one at a time) and you have a decently strong level of piano sight reading ability, then I\u2019d say a piano teacher might be worth lessons every so often if it\u2019s affordable because I\u2019d say you\u2019re starting to max the limits of your ability to assess your execution of technique (you\u2019ll want someone to actually watch how you move, see where you should go, and give you specific cues on what you can shore up from there). \n\nBut honestly when I was training classical piano regularly as a kid (good god I feel old saying that but I know I\u2019m not lol), majority of upper level technique mishaps stemmed from struggles with proper wrist & elbow position where students would let their form slide (the more advanced the composition you were playing, the harder it became to remember your technique) and so they\u2019d lack the actual strength and muscle twitch to hit harder moves.   That along with finger strength & dexterity would often result in stumbles or slips, which also vary based on how you strike the key. Most common error you\u2019ll see that slows down technique is wrists dipping below the fingers a la traditional keyboard typing at any point in the playing process, and you\u2019re never gonna swing an arpeggio or move fast enough to trill because your physical relation to the keys is what dictates proficiency. The physical aspect is why pianists are brought in so young (I started at supervised playing at 4 and I started instruction when I could get through the alphabet), because you can shape them into technique machines. \n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for max utility, finger drills, wrist position, and scales as much as possible is going to keep you sharp as hell.",

    "content": "@oaklandmatt Thank you for the suggestions.\n\nI'm very close to this point now. I'm doing 4 octave scale runs with both hands at various tempos to focus on consistency of fingering and of tone. The next frontier is doing a variation of these runs where one hand starts on a scale different interval (going up in 3rds, 4ths, etc...)\n\nThe exercise that's challenging me at the moment has been doing wide arpeggios (sometimes with intervals of a 7th or more) up and down a two octaves. I'm taking it slow and becoming more consistent, but I know I'm likely to start hitting a wall as I get them up to a quicker tempo, hence the renewed focus on really getting my technique right at these tempos.\n\nI've very much internalized the concept of \"Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.\" I'm starting things slow and not moving on until I can do them flawlessly at glacial tempos.\n\n@ehutton21 I think you're right about a teacher. LA is undoubtedly full of good ones. A lesson a week should help me to orient myself in the right direction.\n\nThank you for all of the insight.",

    "content": "> There was a noticeable number of US clients (artists + their entourages, certain producers, and especially writers - usually in pop or hip hop) who treated assistants like \u201cthe help\u201d / waiting staff / taxi drivers / some menial worker they felt was beneath them. The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nI want to add to what Ruair\u00ed and Matt B said with another perspective. I've had the privilege of working in some very professional settings, where everyone needs to fade into the background to do their jobs properly, and that's absolutely the case at higher levels. And it makes things work. And everyone's cool about it.\n\nBut much of my work has been as producer, assistant producer or project manager/fixer for people working at decidedly lower levels. \n\nAnd idk how it is in other countries, but we have a glut of people here in the US who have a certificate from a for-profit recording school that says they know what they're doing, who think they're *the shit* for being in the room with some viral star off YouTube/Instagram/TikTok. But don't know how to use a damn patch bay. \n\nAnd when you're on the come up, especially as a writer or producer, you interact with a lot of these people, and you get REALLY sick of them REALLY fast. So that might be the source of some of the condescension you see. It's hard not to get jaded when you have to wade through so much incompetence. I feel like a bitter old man just typing this paragraph tbh but I hope I'm not the only one with this experience.",

Imagine this tech in a DAW - move a chord change, or a section, and all of the bits that would need to be adjusted to make it feel natural just happen automatically. You'd still have the flexibility to go in and adjust as desired, but as a way to instantly try ideas (or, respond to notes), there is a lot of potential there.",

    "content": "So sound is captured as electrical signals by disturbing a magnetic field (or in the case of condenser mics, changing the voltage potential across a specially tuned capacitor), which generates an AC voltage corresponding to the compressions and rarefactions in the air. This is a whole topic on its own but tl;dr for dynamics you're moving a magnet back and forth inside a coil of wire, with ribbons you're moving the wire back and forth inside a magnetic field, guitar and bass pickup you're disturbing a magnetic field with vibrating ferromagnetic strings... anyway. \n\nLinear voltage amplifiers (ie class A, and AB for us audio guys) - which we use for mic preamps, line amps, differential amps, power amps, pretty much anything you can think of - work by using an AC voltage to vary DC current flow. In its most basic form, it works like this: That AC signal from the mic or guitar pickup hits either the grid of a vacuum tube or the gate of a FET, and changes the amount of current that flows from one end to the other (usually cathode to plate in a tube, and usually source to drain in FETs). Stick a resistor between the DC power supply rail and the amplifying element and you get a voltage variance because of ohm's law - current goes down, voltage goes up, and vice versa. So, you end up with a bigger version of the input signal, with its polarity inverted. \n\nDistortion is a *way* more complex topic and not one I'm equipped to explain, as I don't understand it very well myself.",

With respect to the power supply , . Id not heard this theory before , I wonder if Anyone else is familiar with it . So he said as a result of a limited power supply available to all the channels  , as the. Different frequency content of the individual channels varies it draws different voltages on the channels , with the lower frequencies (ie bass , kick channels ) demanding a larger share of the available voltage when they \u201coccur \u201c . This process occurs within the context of a limited available power supply , so it results in a simultaneous dip in power available in some of the other channels  . Hence a natural sort of side chaining in the console. What we saying ? Truth or myth",

The Question Is, Now that you\u2019ve worked with all these great artists, Taylor, Jack, Dominic, Lana, All these amazing legendary people, How do you approach your craft now, in terms of attention to detail. Do you reject artists if they approach you to \u201cMaster my album i\u2019ll pay you whatever you want\u201d if you think the level of their sound might not honour your history with all these artists. And, in general, how does it feel having a connection to these artists, i am sure you feel blessed to work with these amazing people, but does it ever happen that you feel like you are wanting more, at the end of the day, we all are humans right, we crave for more cuz thats embedded into our DNA. Congratulations for the new carpenter album. <33",

You'd think \"well of course all the sample libraries I bought can do that just as well\"  but not imxp....  its that the sample libraries can do \"an adequate\" job and satisfythe need.  But once you hire world-class players and play it live into mics....  for me it was instantly \"we could've bought every sample library and programmed for days but never gotten this quality\" in the tiny details.  The bow sounds. The players breathing together. Their adaptation to dynamics. The aleatoric sections where advanced techniques were improvised. Samples can be amazing and do things humans can't...  but the inverse is also true.  There are many context where it's got to be live players, or else your track is just \"adequate\"",

I blended that with a snare I found in the Linn itself, which was a 12-bit machine, so it sounded pretty edgy to start with.\u201d But the coup de grace for the sound was when Z pumped the processed and blended sample through an Auratone speaker set upside down atop another snare drum, which rattled the metal snares and gave the result some ambience and even more high end. The whole thing was limited slightly and then sent to a track on a roll of Ampex 456 running on a Studer A800 at 15 ips. Only a slight amount of reverb was added to the track later on.",

Like we came out of mono and into stereo and Jesus gains were made .!..for all the new clever software have we made those sorts of gains from it ? I think loudness techniques yes defo , but otherwise ? Hmmm . I feel like the best records today are being made by people who really know their engineering ish\u2026..like LWMR was kinda all about imho . \n\nSo it feels like a lot of the promo on \u201canalogue emulations / stem splitters / multi band resonance tools \u201c \u2026..although very clever \u2026.kind of miss the point when it comes to becoming good at this mindfuck of mixing",

Sad when someone of that influence has a take this off base.\n\nI believe the most valuable creative currency of the coming era will be authentic innovation of expression. Creating music that is ahead of the curve of expressing the human experience in a way AI couldn\u2019t have previously copied, since it\u2019s so true to that artist then as a representation of where they are at that time based on all the influences leading up to the moment of creating that art.\n\nThere\u2019s always been a flood of copies after something fresh is made, and I believe AI will make it easier for people to follow-up with products like that, but the forefront is too imbued with the energy of the lived energies zeitgeist to be emulated by code - Perhaps one of the few things that code will never be able to do.\n\nI\u2019m open to being wrong, but that\u2019s the thought this gives me.",

I got a thrill in \u2018seeing the Matrix\u2019 and coming up with my own ways to do things, but ONLY if it had results tied to it. \n\nI have a 6th place finish I got over 10 years ago that I\u2019ll never forget, because I was so obsessed with getting top 5 (preferably #1 but I\u2019d always lie to myself that the next threshold would be enough, but it never was) I was destroying my mind and body and my health was affected. I had to stop focusing on competing and find the deeper layers behind what I was really running from by attaching my self worth to competing like a parasite scared of losing its host.\n\nMusic was actually such a perfect remedy because I can always improve my ability to translate my ideas into reality, but there is no optimal result. No truly perfect song or finish line. Hunting world records was a life of quick-sand, always trying to keep up with the past while showing you can still do it in the present. \n\nThose days of competing taught me that entering the ring, doing my best, and letting go of any care of result is where true joy lies. Any connection to an activity and my self worth, or my complicated authentic identity, has nothing to do with the outcome of how my time was spent, but instead the win of having the ratio of the time I spend in life doing what fulfills me.\n\n-\n\nI made music at that time too, but ever since these breakthroughs my music has become far more authentic, which makes me feel like it\u2019s better. It jumped the quality of my work way more than any technique, because now I sit down to express exactly who I am in that moment, and everything else is a subconscious implementation of everything I\u2019ve learned thus far.",

You'll likely get better sonic results if you can find a room with some more volume... that will also allow you to play with position in front of the microphone. As far as the level you should record at, if you've got any half-decent mic pre than you can go into the computer pretty conservatively. Assuming you don't have a super noisy chain, there'll be plenty of headroom in a 24 bit recording to bring it up after the fact. If you're looking for numbers, I'd shoot to get things into your DAW at around -18 dBFS. Many of the plugins modeled after analog gear tend to be happier with that level (or less if you're unsure).",

It still seems in development, but the one thing that really bothered me about the interface was the inability to link mix versions under some sort of tree system. So you could quickly switch between V1 or V5 and have everything organized that way. I found the clients still referencing older versions when we had already moved beyond. The note system was really useful though if the client is into that level of detail (this particular one was, so it was a benefit).",

Now I just drive a lil longer to get to a show or a bar, whenever I go to one. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Long story short: LA (and greater LA) is huge and if you look around you can find loads of different options.\n\nAlso I\u2019ll say I would NOT have wanted to live where I am now when I first moved here. Living in Los Feliz was awesome for being central and meeting people/getting my bearings, and LA being LA maybe there was some superficial bullshit cachet to being able to say I live in the cool part of town. I am less oriented to the pop world specifically, but Los Feliz/Silverlake/Echo Park/Highland Park/Atwater are all the places where the shit I think is cool and exciting happens. If anyone is considering a move to LA, I\u2019d really recommend finding a place close to where the shows/people are that you\u2019re interested in. Live there and rent for a while.",

I'm listening to this Baby Keem/Kendrick track right now and it's ruining it for me.\n\nI recently re-listened to 'Blacks Reconstruction' by The Roots and it's completely unlistenable now that it has a good 80 edits in it, despite being labeled as the \"Album Version\": https://open.spotify.com/track/6cq1D3ZaL8SrrHkgHB8nwl?si=6720c9125a9e40b8\n\nIt's not as if records like this ever stood a chance of pop appeal and required an edited version to reach an audience. It's so dense with profanity that it'll never be played in public anyway. Now because of this censorship not only does it fail at being acceptable to a broad audience it's also rendered unlistenable to it's intended mature audience.\n\nIf I didn't already love this record and didn't already own an uncensored copy I almost certainly would never give it a fair listen and come to appreciate it. I can't help but wonder if a lot of great music today is being rejected out of hand and not discovered by new listeners because of the censorship.",

    "content": "Do you have any way of recording at home? You mention \"while you are not actually recording\". The best way to practice is to literally do it as often as possible even if it's by yourself. You won't train the social aspect, you won't really train problem solving of an external source (a guitarist with a particularly shitty amp or playing technique per-say), but you can certainly experiment endlessly on capturing sounds. Shootouts, micing techinques, it's pretty much endless. If you don't have a recording setup at home or are in an apartment where you can't be as loud as you'd want, I try to absorb as much information as I can. Podcasts (Andrew Talks to Awesome People / Unstoppable Recording Machine / Working Class Audio / Conversations Audio), Online articles, (Sound on Sound) GearSpace Forum Q+A, TapeOp interviews, Youtube Series (Making Records with EV, Sounds-Like-a-Drum), etc. These can be incredibly inspiring and keep your mind tuned into the recording process.  I sort of use this as my \"fix\" when I am not able to work actively on a project. Otherwise, what everyone else has said about mixing are perfect suggestions. Maybe set limitations like only using plugins you haven't used. or remove a plugin you are constantly using to force yourself out of a habit. Practice editing dramatically even if the track doesn't call for it so you can get your editing chops up.",

Only anechoic chambers provide that environment , so this is an unnatural sonic reality we begin composing in , in our DAWS . Obvs, analog emulation plug ins simply generate a little white noise to mimic the noise sound of real life electronic audio gear,  to trick us into the feeling of a more natural  ambience . I much prefer choosing a soundscape and placing it in the background throughout the track as a noise floor",

Your hand floats and stays loose over the pad.\n\n2. Can be placed right beneath the keyboard (if you're not already using a laptop) and cuts *way* down on travel time for your mousing hand as it travels from keys to mouse and back. It's always in the same place, so you never lose a moment of focus searching for the mouse with your eyes or adjusting your grip once you grab it, which adds up.\n\nIf you want to get *really* fancy you can press keys *and* use a trackpad with one hand in certain instances.\n\n3. Multi-touch commands, bebe! (swipe, stretch, pinch, etc)\n\n4. Can be ambidextrous if necessary.",

That combined with either LCD-X or Focal Clear MG Pro for quiet environments and HD25 for everything else.

It's simply not very high on my list of priorities. I'd say I'm self-centered in how I approach making music. I'm out to make stuff that *I* want to hear. Things that aren't being represented elsewhere. Flavors I've never heard. I'm not aiming for a broad appeal, but I'm also not shying away from it. I'm just not much of a people pleaser in that regard. I'm in it for the discovery and the exploration and the pleasure of making something that excites me.\n\nI think often about that Steve Jobs sentiment of \"People don't know what they want until they see it.\" I think about that a lot. I trust that if I follow what feels good to *me* then I'll get something valuable out of it, and maybe it'll connect with others. If not, that's alright too. I'll know that I've made something that feels great.\n\nI sometimes worry about this because I've always felt that it puts me at odds with a lot of people out here trying to make excellent records. Sometimes our goals will align, but I just don't feel motivated by the need to appeal to a lot of people and that can also make us diverge.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a different kind of taste that I'm trying to cultivate. It's one that runs parallel to the kind of taste that is good at appealing to a large number of people. I feel as if I'm aiming at an entirely different goalpost from people playing the other game. I want to tickle people in a way that they didn't know they were capable of. That's what's thrilling to me.",

(Lol.)\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to live in nyc my entire adult life and never have\u2014it\u2019s never made sense to do it career-wise and probably never really will. But every time I\u2019m there I feel totally at home and happy and excited in a way I don\u2019t anywhere else. I spent a summer there several years ago and always linger as long as I can whenever I can, have close friends there (not in music), end up there usually a couple times a year and relish it every time. I feel like I know it as well as is possible for never having been a resident.\n\nI know the music biz there is pretty much defunct (at least compared to LA), and I really *really* don\u2019t want to repeat the emotional and financial ruin that I experienced moving to LA and restarting everything 6 yrs ago\u2026 but from a non-career perspective it\u2019s where I want to be.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m in it to fucking win it in LA for my career\u2014though with an eye for sure on getting to a point where I can relatively comfortably make that move.\n\nAny wisdom/experience on making a mid-career move like this from folks here? I\u2019m 35 yrs old, some decent credits but not major traction yet, in a basically married but not actually married relationship with a school principal who is into the idea of a move there as well (though our finances are totally separate and I for sure need to earn!), no kids or desire/plan to have kids.\n\nAny benchmarks/goals that might be reasonable to aim for before seriously starting to make moves on this? I\u2019d do it tomorrow if I could, but would also stay in LA for 5+ more years no prob to set things up properly. Even open to things like a podcast (/radio?/other audio prod) gig to help smooth the transition if that\u2019s reasonable to find and lucrative enough\u2014but what I\u2019m really looking for is how to think of this as a full time freelance record maker. Or if someone on here secretly is hiring for staff gigs at Electric Lady, plz lmk \ud83d\ude09",

A lot of little things coming together is what makes up the \u2018innate talent\u2019. Things that give certain people a head start on different crafts can probably be analyzed into different components. While \u201ceither you have it or you don\u2019t\u201d can lead to defeatist thinking, I believe seeing them as a make up of different components can really bring out individuals\u2019 best self. \n\nwe all have our fortes, but not everyone is able to break them down and integrate the different strengths to create synergy. And the \u201ctalented\u201d individuals are the ones who has integrated the different strengths, whether it was through deliberate discoveries or something that was given to them circumstantially. I believe rephrasing \u2018innate talent\u2019 to something like \u2018natural qualities/traits\u2019 can lead to more freedom and more useful perspective than \u201cI could never be like X\u201d - because of course you can\u2019t, you are not X. \n\nWhich brings back to what you were saying about the value of  journey over the prize",

I\u2019ve heard so many people in my family say they have no musical talent or they\u2019re terrible at piano, but they\u2019ve never practiced for 15 minutes. What\u2019s the measurable difference between Yo-Yo Ma and your uncle?\n\nMy gut feeling is that most of talent comes down to commitment/focus (interest in the craft) and learning styles, and then culture and early exposure mold that into an affinity.\n\nSome people will suck at an art form, put in the work, and then not suck anymore. Some will be born with a brain that\u2019s wired to seeing shapes, and find it easy to visualize patterns on a guitar neck. Some will be auditory learners and may find it easier to learn to identify intervals by ear.\n\nAnd then some people will grow up singing or playing in church, and those people get the cheat codes from a *very* young age while their brains are still spongey, learning things like their first language. Of course they weren\u2019t born playing the organ, but it can look that way from the outside.\n\nIt seems both mystical and defeatist when people who don\u2019t think they have talent talk about people who do\u2014almost like an excuse. And maybe that\u2019s intentional, and exactly the point you\u2019re making.",

Decades later in the digital world of an instant studio in a box, it\u2019s not really obvious that some super bright tech came up with the routing ideas and then created the electrical circuitry for it .

You're pretty spot on in your assumptions - Slot 1 is the AMD graphics card which is currently holding my LG Ultrafine TB, Caldigit TS4, and Blackmagic Ultrastudio. That alone is a lot of TB connections. But then the afterburner card is in slot 5, yep. I can move that to slot 3 leaving my OWC Accelsior 8M2 in slot 4. I may also need to redistribute my TB connections to lighten the load. \n\nCurrently, my 3xApollo's are daisy chained and fed into Slot 8 (Mac IO) with two USB connections also there (1 is midi box). \n\nIt's mind blowing that I never really thought to think about WHERE I am plugging things in, so naive. \n\nI'm going to try moving some things around and will report back. \n\nLast thought - should I just...rip out the Afterburner all together?",

They won\u2019t be able to get a disability check, but will have harder time living than others with average or higher intelligence. \n\nIt gave me a new perspective on why I can\u2019t seem to communicate with or understand certain people, and that it needs to be approached with empathy whenever possible. \n\n+ poverty can affect people\u2019s brain development. not only from the lack of education but the stress that goes on in the household due to poverty can affect children\u2019s brain development.

If I\u2019m \u201cmaking content\u201d and notice that I\u2019m doing so out of a place that is less than genuine, I will just delete and move on. \n\nFor me, the \u201cmix tips\u201d thing came out of a sincere place of excitement and passion. I would, as a growing mix engineer, stumble upon something that excited me, and I would find myself wanting to turn around to the people in the room to share\u2026well, there\u2019s almost never anyone in the room with me. So, I channeled that passion and excitement in a genuine way to share with the small community of mixers, mastering engineers and producers that I knew on IG. \n\nAt the beginning of my career on to the middle of my career, that became a very fruitful source of business for me - people who followed me on IG, who enjoyed my posts, and began to view me as someone who MIGHT know a thing or two about mixing. \n\nAs my career has developed and my clientele has growing, that has become less important, but it was absolutely pivotal in helping me build a deep bench of great clients, both indie and signed. \n\nBut\u2026I NEVER did it for that reason. It was always (and continues to be) a genuine result of my passion for what I do.",

    "content": "I was recently inspired after going to the cinema to see *A Complete Unkown*, the movie memoir about Bob Dylan; partially by Bob's story, but also by Timothy Chalomee's performance as Bob. All of the shots of him performing in the movie were fully live - which is an impressive feat by itself - but even more impressive that he apparently wasn't much of a musician before making the movie. I didnt know much about Timothy before this, so I watched his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's YouTube channel. One thing I found really interesting was how available he made himself to learning the role. For example, he didn't turn his phone on for 3 months straight. Got me thinking about how much I can get distracted during the day, and how these distractions can get in the way of me actually giving 100% to the art that I'm working on. I'm sure you all can imagine how the distractions in your own life can effect your work. Might be TikTok videos, might be discord, might be lusting over getting new converters or monitors or guitars, etc, you get the idea. So I guess what I'm saying here is that if I want to compete with the best, maybe I have to understand how to impliment systems in my life that allows me to be more available to the things that I am working on. I want it to be like lifiting a heavy weight at the gym - at the bottom of a heavy squat, you've no choice but to focus on pushing the bar back up with good form, cos that think will break you otherwise. There's a certain thing that happens in your brain when you're forced to only think about one thing for a prolonged, or even short period. It's something akin to meditating. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is if anyone has ever given this subject any thought before, and if anyone has ever done anything to get better at these things? I'm still not sure if all this only makes sense inside my own head.",

Vocals and guitar recorded over a 2track beat. I typically throw a Waves L2 on my master, just to bring up the level for the rough bounce, never doing much more than a dB or two of gain reduction. In this case I had the threshold of the L2 set at -3.4. The producer said try -3.5, then back to -3.4, then -3.5\u2026 flipping back and forth seeing what he liked more. I couldn\u2019t hear a difference. (I should say that we weren\u2019t in a well treated room, working on some mid sized genelecs. It\u2019s a  setup neither of us is super familiar with.) He decided -3.4 was better and I was in disbelief that he could even hear a difference. I asked if I could do a blind test to see if he could tell which setting was which. He closed his eyes and I switched back and forth a bunch of times before landing on a setting, and he called it correct three times in a row. He said he could hear something in the kick drum but couldn\u2019t explain more than that.\nI need a sanity check. I know my ears aren\u2019t hall of fame, but I\u2019m still in disbelief that he was able to tell a .1dB difference in volume on the limiter.",

But on this topic, I find it hard/impossible to completely 100% enjoy a piece of work after the artist has done something disagreeable, taken a public downfall or occasionally if I had a negative personal experience with them. Even though I might intellectually appreciate the beauty of the work, my heart just feels a slight bit of ick -- akin to that feeling of trying to enjoy a meal that you know is super delish but you burned your tongue on a hot cup of coffee the day before. So I\u2019ll just end up choosing to listen to something else instead. This also makes me intensely appreciate my past experiences with the art. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever enjoy it the same way again but I\u2019m so glad I was able to completely enjoy Puff Daddy productions, R. Kelly songs, Woody Allen\u2019s movies, Bill Cosby\u2019s comedy, and Kanye West\u2019s early albums when they were coming out and having their day. I\u2019m resolved that it was a time in my life and in the universe and that time might be over now. Kinda like the ex-girl that you remember fondly but would never ever ever go back to.",

I've only come across Lemon Tree and had a friend at the lockouts at Kingsize. \n\nAnd then also a big question for anybody who's moved their set up out of their homes: Have you seen the ROI on moving your space out of your home/apt? I like the idea of moving my studio out because of the ability to have an artist/client come over without them being in my personal space. It wasn't that big of a deal to me when I was living alone and younger, but now that I'm getting a little older and living with my girlfriend, I grow less fond of the idea of people coming over to work. And if you did move out, did having that professional middle ground increase your business? \n\nI've never leased a studio before, but just a thought as life is moving along and I think I'll be able to lease a place! So, just wanted to see everyone's experience with this life and career move!",

I\u2019ve had many wins, but going a long period without financial wins has made me question the judgement I have when navigating everything.\n\n\u201cWinning\u201d to me is a culmination of things that can be summed up as living authentically while positively contributing to the world and lives of others. It helps fight of the tendrils of negativity I feel coming from so many angles of the outside world, especially in the last decade.\n\nI don\u2019t exactly know what I\u2019m asking. Or want. I\u2019m looking to process these feelings and synthesize them into a new level of awareness as I move forward with what I\u2019ve learned being integrated into my subconscious.\n\nSometimes being around others, or hearing their experiences and takes, helps me get angles of things in a way that I can piece together for a rough draft of what will become the lesson that I carry with me moving forward, regarding this topic at this time.",

It\u2019s tough to breakthrough in here (anywhere tbh) in English without the help of a label (which I do not want), so imo joining forces and fan bases on an EP could work nicely since playlisting can help. A friend of mine, not a very good EDM producer manages to get to great numbers with submithub and hypeeddit, which only make sense in widely spread languages and Czech isn\u2019t one of them",

Getting the full project player solves this. Have never had an issue delivering for mastering since it's simple, just a single player shared (never sharing individual parts within a project). But more points to @Rollmottle that Samply is an upstart and can have issues\n\nSo good to have an alternative method at the ready should people need. Dropbox solves this for me, it's on my phone at a second's notice. That said I don't think I've had an error pop up in Samply yet. Just sometimes people like the Dropbox for a complicated delivery",
