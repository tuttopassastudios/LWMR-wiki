    "content": "Ok Long Post alert, but touches on a few things we harp on around here. \n\nSo my little bro is in town- we made dinner for one of his oldest friends who just moved to town with his wife. He\u2019s a fantastic mandolin player and his wife is a singer/songwriter. \n\nOf course I did the ol\u2019 studio walk through, listening to all the tunes on the ear calibration playlist, then let them play some of their own favs. Of course they\u2019re blown away and have never heard music like this etc. \n\nBut to drive the point home I show them a song @Rollmottle and I turned around in just over 24 hours. \u201cThe reason for the speakers & treatment etc is so we can make decisions quickly blah blah blah.\u201d  I pull up the session and we listen through and they\u2019re loving it- but I\u2019m noticing it doesn\u2019t have the 3D thing that all the other music we\u2019ve been listening to has. \n\nThen I show them the mastered version. An mp3. It\u2019s louder and better sounding and all, until the first BGV stack hits\u2026 then it\u2019s IMMERSIVE. We listened to the whole thing again just to enjoy the magic and notice all the ways the master improved it. So far beyond zapping resonances and making it loud, @Rollmottle made it sound\u2026 important. Made *me* sound like a good mixer. \n\nIt was heavier lifting for him cause I didn\u2019t have the benefit of time for fresh ears or to detail the vocal the way I normally would. Also had the good fortune of having @Ross Fortune on speed dial and on GMT to give it a listen at 5am PST. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re curious, or dubious, I\u2019ll DM files so you can hear what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nTL;DR: monitoring matters, fresh perspective matters. Don\u2019t produce mix *and* master your own shit.",

Not judging anyone who has that opportunity AT ALL b/c myself and most of the rest of us would do the same, but it's always good to remember everyone has a situation that the rest of us won't be fully aware of.",

Producers moreso than mixers.\n\nWhen I find a record that resonates with me I'm very full-immersion and I'll devour as much of their adjacent body of work as I can. I'll start scrutinizing the record credits and pulling on threads as I see them. I really try to fill in the context around the record by identifying all collaborators, timelines, interviews they gave around that time, published works, etc. I've got a huge appetite for that thing.\n\nI really love reading books written by producers. The more old school the better. Phil Ramone's *Making Records* is a great one. That guy is a class act. Quincy Jones has both an autobiography *and* a book specifically on producing. The latter is a great no-shortcuts look at what it takes to be great. I enjoyed Daniel Lanois' *Soul Mining*, since he's got a very thoughtful immersive way of making records and working with artists that I appreciate.",

    "content": "Stereo. I tried out some Atmos headphone mixes at an Apple store kiosk a while ago because I was curious. I can't say that it had much of an effect on me. Maybe I need to live with them for longer and get used to it.\n\nLast week was the first time that I was able to sit in front of an Atmos setup that was meant for music (aka: not in a movie theater) and really get the full musical experience. In fact, I got to sit in front of *three* different Atmos rigs in three different (treated) rooms that evening and two of them were undoubtedly set up as good as they could have possibly been (One was a PMC showroom and the other built and tuned with their input). While the speakers themselves were impressive and very capable, the actual experience felt pretty disjointed. There was a pronounced feeling of phasi-ness that I didn't like.\n\nIt was great hearing these records on a rig that probably cost $250k, but my big takeaway was that they felt disjointed and odd. Even when sitting in the sweet spot.\n\nPerhaps my opinion will change with more exposure, but I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the time and effort. I will add, though, that half the mixes we heard were up-mixed from old stereo recordings with minimal track counts and only two of them were modern productions.",

We can go outside and listen to a band in a room and hear reflections all around us. But there is a chance to go deeper with spatial audio, to create something hyper-real, as much of record making has always been. Every new technology has the opportunity to enhance or detract from our experiences, and we have to meet them where they are. Maybe Atmos ain't it, but as someone who spends a lot of time in surround.. there is a feeling to immersing yourself in sound that isn't going to come from two speakers. So yes.. mixing in Atmos can very much be a part of steering the ship.",

I thought the headphones weren\u2019t on and the sound was coming out of my phone in the room the first time I tried it. Sounds crazy (pretty neat!). Not sure if it would make music more enjoyable but it seems Serban and Jon hanes have already been doing atmos versions of some of their major label releases for a while now\u2026 curious to see how it translates! I saw Josh gudwin built an atmos room too, and Greg wells was talking about it\u2026 so seems it\u2019s already happened. I\u2019d imagine the budget is higher/extra on those versions for the mix?",

The mixes obviously vary in quality, but two main problems I notice in all the songs I've heard are 1) A roomy/chourusy sound, which is not a creative choise, but rather seems like an algorithm, which ruins 'in your face vocals' imh. 2) Missing the glue. - These songs may sound amazing on speakers, but from a consumer standpoint, I believe that the binaural Atmos for headphones is gonna be the way 99.9 people are gonna listen.

I believe in the Atmos format for headphones for that reason. But i think it would require mixing engineers to mix with headphones in mind if that washy/roomy sound should disappear",

Some of the subjects were audio professionals and some were lay people.\nWhen the subjects listened back to these recordings, there was significant variance in their ability to localize the sound sources. If I remember correctly, they were generally better at listening through their own pinnae than others were, and audio professionals were a bit better at sound localization in general, particularly in the traditional stereo field. However, the really interesting finding was that there were some pinnae that were universally better or worse. People actually had improved localization through someone else\u2019s pinnae than their own, implying that although we are adapted to our own pinnae, there are material differences that make some better than others for localization of sound.\nThis is all from memory of reading something a few months ago, so I apologize if there are details that aren\u2019t 100% accurate, but I assure you that the surprising bit is correct!\n\nHRTF-based binaural mixes are not exactly the same thing as dummy head recordings, but I wonder if, in the creation of the aforementioned \u201cballer individual HRTF\u2019s\u201d there might be a place for some optimization beyond the exact copying of an individual\u2019s unique acoustic properties.",

They put electret mics in your ears, record IR sweeps of each speaker in your room through them, then put headphones on, record IR sweeps of those, then have some sort of sum/difference algo that translates it all.\n\nWhen you get measured, go for relatively high SPL sweeps.

    "content": "In my studio I have almost 10 kW of class D amps. Last I checked my entire studio idled at around 4 amps and with the system going full throttle with atmos it was hitting around 6 amps. That would be around 700 W. When I've had power outages I have had the breaker trip when power comes back on from everything trying to power on at the same time. No clue how much that would theoretically need but if you don't try to turn everything on at the same time, a 1800 W generator should be plenty for most set ups",
