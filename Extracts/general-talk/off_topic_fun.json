Did you catch it?\n\nIf not, which channel did he post it in? The hell if *I* know! Luckily we no longer have to trawl the Discord logs to locate it. His entire essay is now being hosted on the newly minted *Resources* section of the LWMR website.\n\nIn the coming weeks we\u2019ll be filling this section in with some of the very best posts and nuggets of wisdom that have come through the LWMR server so far. No more brilliant posts lost forever in the torrent of people talking about Topping DACs or asking for a collab channel. Today we\u2019re laying the foundations so that future generations might someday know how to make their 808s go *brrrrrrr*.\n\nhttps://www.livewithmattrad.com/resources",

And just bake into the equation that you\u2019ll suck for probably 50-100 songs. Because every success is built on a ton of previous sucking. Even Michael Jordan got cut from his highschool basketball team cause he sucked. But no one got worse at something the more they did it. You\u2019re not supposed to be good at something right away. You\u2019re supposed to suck, until you finally don\u2019t. But you get to the suck less phase by actually sucking lots.",

I crushed it on a deadline, then that same A&R hired me a year later to work on a band called Emblem 3 who was on X Factor US as well. I crushed that and then six months after that he recommended me to a UK A&R who was having trouble finishing a song for One Direction. I did a spec production on the song Best Song Ever and they liked it and used it and all of a sudden I become a big pop producer.

    "content": "Without going too therapist couch on the details, I was the only kid that had to lie to my parents in highschool and tell them I was going to parties (which were ok) and then went to work playing shows on the sunset strip (which was banned). Moving to Australia to join a band in my early 20s got me excommunicated from half of my family, some of whom I didn\u2019t get to talk to for nearly a decade. Some had credible experience in the industry, others just in life, but truthfully, if you care about someone\u2019s quality of life and ability to provide for themselves and hopefully a family, you don\u2019t steer them towards a career in music. \n\nBut, I wouldn\u2019t be told no, and every time I was pushed away from something I wanted to do (I couldn\u2019t go to school in LA because it was too close to the industry) I ended up somewhere that actually furthered my career (I ended up in San Diego, where I became friends with the Switchfoot guys which really helped launch me). It\u2019s why I have such little patience for the \u201coh the studio manager was short with me while I was an assistant\u201d crowd\u2026 if you want it bad enough, you figure out a way to make it work. And if you don\u2019t want it bad enough, there\u2019s a hundred more guys like me that do, that are willing to sacrifice their time/health/money/etc to the cause. I don\u2019t say that to frame it as admirable or healthy or anything positive, it\u2019s just the truth of how things are. \n\nSo, that person that\u2019s going to quit because a studio manager was challenging, or a teacher didn\u2019t like their song? They\u2019re going to get devoured by the people that really dedicate their lives to this, and it feels cruel to tell them otherwise.",

    "content": "\u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d - Ira Glass",

    "content": "Re; Brauer workshop\n\n-First 2 days were nothing technical, the 1st conversation he brought up was about TM and how meditation in general has helped him.\n-Everything is feel-based, most technical Q's for the first 2 and a half days got the same reply: \"It doesn't matter to me, i don't care what the thing is long as it feels good\". \n-MHB actually seems to leave the planet while he's mixing, it's wild how immediate he gets into that space. Seemed to go way past \"i love mixing and here's all the reasons i'm the shit\" and it was inspiring to see the ego leave the equation. His decades of experience are playing directly into his ability to access the story of the song and present it in a compelling, live-feeling way. He mixes from inside the song and performs. Well, he does discovery, then shapes the sounds, then performs just about everything on faders.\n-The biggest wake up call to me is that a lot of moves i've made on mixes did not have a good reason behind them. So continuing to ask \"why\" as I work is gonna be important, because I have to start catching myself and adjusting when the answer to \"why\" is \"because someone said this preset is cool\" or \"because this is what I do to a vocal/guitar/drums\". I feel music very deeply, it's why i got into this, but I feel like i've been poisoned against trusting that instinct and convinced that what we do is a technical job. I'm done being an observer of the art, i want to be bold.\n-It's critical to build trust with clients right away, you can't assume anything in what they understand about how you feel. Telling them you love the song and you're excited to mix it is important, and never blaming production/artist/anything else for the mix being less than what it should be. never okay to say \"i did my best\", because that gives you an out and implies somebody else could do it better\n-Therefore, you must believe when you sit down to mix that nobody is gonna interpret this song better than you.\n-Generally i'm skeptical to just take on someone else's \"method\" and start operating in that space just becuase of the success they've had with it. Putting this week into practice is going to mean using his template to get reps in, listening and feeling and interacting in a new way and letting my brain \"level up\", if you will, then zooming out and making it my own.\n\n\nI can distill this more and want to share about a couple other specifics, but I just realized I grabbed someone else's notebook by mistake when I left on the last day so I'll need to have them mail mine back to me.",

Music will always be there, and it's not an all-or-nothing proposition. \n\nI'm not trying to prescribe the way out of this, but give yourself some grace and permission to navigate it. You're not less-than because you take time to address your personal life and finances in the midst of building your career, you're human.",

It\u2019s SO MUCH EASIER to say \u201clet\u2019s try it\u201d than to say \u201chere\u2019s why that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d I find I learn a lot that way too. \n\nIn any case, going back in to fix or add only bugs me when I think I\u2019m supposed to be done. If I can stay open, then opening a session feels a lot easier. \n\nSo I guess my advice is: you might have fewer problem clients if you try to remember they\u2019re not problems to solve, they\u2019re people to serve.",

This is a great development and we love to see lively, thoughtful conversations. \n\nWith this increase in posting comes a lot of information that can sometimes be overwhelming to manage and parse. Especially when a channel has two different conversations happening on top of each other. I think we've all casually opened the app at one point and seen \"40+ unread messages\" and been taken aback by the sheer amount of convo that we now have to catch up on.\n\nMoving forward I ask the following from everyone:\n\n*1. If you see a conversation starting to ramp up use Discord\u2019s **Create Thread** feature to fork off the conversation into a self-contained thread. (see attached pic)\n2. Give the thread a descriptive name.\n3. Continue all follow-up posts within the new thread.*",

    "content": "Feeling like shite, scheduled an in person mix review, in order to finish this project - communication wasn't being effective, so I though it would be easier this way to get something that would make us both proud.\nGot the dry files from the producer 1h before meeting with the band.\n\nThe project is finished on my side. On to mastering now. Today feels like the first day of my life \ud83d\ude06\n\nAll of this to say what I think is really important and some things I learned that I wish I knew when I was in the middle of those project blues:\n1) you WILL get through it.\n2) it might be possible to turn it down or pass it to another person\n3) trust yourself and your skills to make the best you can\n4) set boundaries and expectations. From the start. With the artist and yourself.\n5) try to find something you can enjoy during the process - to me, it was on the very last day of mixing that I changed something on my workflow that got me excited, helped me get to the sound of the album we were looking for and will probably be something I will do for every project from now on\n6) surround yourself from colleagues/friends who can help you - I know this needs a strike of luck too, but I'm sure if you don't have a reliable in-person \"work friend\" who can be there for you (with kindness, while keeping it real), this discord might be a good place to ask for that kind of help.",

But it took years of patiently learning the ropes at the highest level to be trusted by the folks in the highest circles. I look back upon that now and I\u2019m still amazed that I was paid to do that. It was essentially like a paid college degree in making records.\n\nSo now when I go into studios with a big client, I see the assistant through those eyes. I\u2019m kind but communicative. If they can hang in the back and figure out how I work, anticipate breaks \u2014 get the menu book ready \u2014 know that we\u2019re going to change gears \u2014 start setting up for that \u2014 then they get looped in. They get my running commentary on what techniques I\u2019m doing. They get the inside baseball\u2026 \u201cI wish they fired this fucking drummer\u201d. \n\nI agree with Ruairi that this type of coming up through the ranks is a loss for up and comers. It was tried and true way to make people understand the ins and outs of studio technique, etiquette, professionalism. I\u2019m glad I got to ride one of the last waves of it. I wouldn\u2019t be here making records at this level if it weren\u2019t for the opportunities I had at the bottom levels of the industry.",

    "content": "To piggyback on @cian riordan 's point, there are real, tangible benefits to being quiet in the back of the room. I would love to be a fly on the wall while @BatMeckley is producing a chart-topping vocalist, or see how Cian works through a first pass of a mix for his next Grammy-winning client. I guarantee they've learned a thing or two about how to talk to sensitive, demanding, highly respected artists. And they've learned how to interpret vague feedback (\"make the vocal less green\")  and working with people who can't articulate what they want. These are things you can't learn by watching Youtube videos or going to school.\n\nWhen I was an assistant at Remote Control, getting to sit in and see how Hans handles a note from Jerry Bruckheimer taught me more than years of music education. Watching my boss struggle for 6 months on a 10-minute cue and then sit in a meeting with grace and calm while he's being told to change everything he just spent many long nights working on. \n\nThat's not to mention things like learning how the real pros handle file management, deliveries, deadlines, tech problems, etc.. There is so much beyond learning the gear that comes from being a good assistant. If Matt knows you're going to shut up AND have his back with lackluster cookies, he's going to let you hang in the room longer. Which means you can absorb and learn more. It's a win-win.",

For me, getting out of my own way is not over analyzing every step I take and re-litigating every mix decision to the point where I end up only releasing a handful of songs every few years.  At some point, no matter what our individual issues are, we have to log off the internet and actually make music instead of constantly talking about all of the individual reasons why we can\u2019t. Sometimes, at least in my case, we get analysis paralysis because it\u2019s easier than actually hitting record and just doing the damn thing.

If what you're doing is not having the desired outcome, then it demands a reexamination of what you're doing or what outcome you're aiming for. For some, that can be catastrophic because the worldview they've built, all hinges on everything lining up perfectly. In reality, that is a moonshot mostly out of their control and they need to reset expectations about timing and outcomes. If this person hasn't shored up the fundamental needs of their family or relationship or finances, then it stands to reason they aren't grounded in their reality and for me, would call into question whether they actually have put in their best efforts (best efforts to me would include integrating these factors into my equation and making sure my pursuits aren't the source of added strife for myself or others).",

Despite his very explicit statements about hating political division, it has of course been wildly politicized because everything on the internet is these days.\n\nThe second song is a white male country singer covering a black lesbian female's iconic song ALSO about class. Talk about intersectionality...\n\nThe third song is the longest running solo male #1 song on the Hot 100 from the biggest star in country music (and really one of the biggest stars in the world... just, again, not covered by the current fashion of mainstream culture). It's a kinda-country-but-kinda-just-pop song co-written by the biggest country writer in history (Ashley Gorley) as well as once-rapper-and-Dr-luke-protege J Kash.\n\nThe rest of the chart is interesting too. #4 is a four year old taylor swift song that has gained traction online from her current tour so the label started pushing it as a single. \n\nThere are two Olivia Rodrigo songs, signaling a true new superstar.\n\nThere are two songs from the Barbie soundtrack. In a \"dying\" movie industry currently on strike, when is the last time two songs from a movie soundtrack have been in the top 10? I dunno.\n\nAnd lastly, there's only 1 trap song. The majority of these songs are people playing real instruments and writing more \"classic\" singer-songwriter songs. Rap music is really having a lull after a decade of dominance.",

While she was making her entrance on stage something weird happened to the sound. Loud pop, clicking, and then no signal, but seemed like the in-ears / on stage monitoring were still working. Her and the band played through the entire first song while everyone in the audience was just looking around confused. Many heads turning to the sound board. Eventually the crowd started a 'we can't hear you' chant and Janelle and the band realized what was going on. They all calmly walked off stage. Took maybe ten minutes for it all to get sorted with the sound. Then Janelle and her band proceeded to come back out redo the entire intro / first song and give maybe the greatest live performance I've ever witnessed. The show ended with a double encore. It felt like such an amazing example of class and professionalism. I got the sense that she decided, after walking off the stage the first time, that not a single person in the audience will remember this show being anything but amazing and it was. Truly undeniable. If anyone here has a chance to catch any of the remaining shows on her tour, I could not recommend it enough. \ud83e\udd18",

Let\u2019s set the time horizon to 25 years and acknowledge the seemingly increasing pace of change in the world\n\nOk, the sliders \u2026\n\n**#1 Classics vs Cutting Edge**\nOn this slider 0 represents maximum knowledge in a classical sense - literature, math, mythology, fundamental accepted basics in Biology/Chemistry/Physics etc etc. 10 represents complete literacy in the cutting edge of culture, science and technology - from memes and Reddit culture to AI to synthetic biology and Blockchain etc etc \n\n**#2 Specialist vs Generalist**\nHere 0 represents a very deep and specific knowledge of a chosen field (could be a doctor or a producer) vs 10 representing a modern Jack of all trades who knows a little bit about a lot of things \n\n**#3 Short Term vs Long Term**\nOn the slider 0 represents a disposition all about short term wins, fast plays that close out over a year vs 10 representing long investments in a given idea/field/belief system\n\nIt goes without saying that the zero sum aspect here is artificial, you can of course have some long term plays happening alongside some short term, but it\u2019s just to get the juices flowing",

I knew the singer liked coffee one way, another guy did something else\u2026 I\u2019d start to have that stuff ready. Instead of chumming it up with the band trying to fend off boredom while Eric was mid task, I stuck around on the couch\u2026 watching patiently. Those were the moments where he would start looping me into what he was doing, explaining his techniques. Before I knew it, I could start anticipating what he would need next. Someone mentions trying some vocals on a thing? I immediately got going on setting up a mic, getting headphones, even starting to dial in a mix on the headphone box. Percussion? Grab the trunk of junk and start laying out potential options. Once I started actually being useful, I\u2019d be given real tasks. \u201cHey, do you think you could try doing a preliminary comp of this vocal?\u201d I had been in the room for all the vocal takes, heard the discussion about approach and vibe, even made the singers coffee the right way\u2026 why not? That evolved into being trusted with recording stuff in the second studio\u2026 we were always running behind, and having me chip away at guitar tracking or re-amping was really useful. Years of this and we were a well oiled machine. I\u2019d get looped into pre-production phone calls and meetings, he would start asking my opinion on things.. drum sounds, microphone choices.",

I've been super under the pump the past few months with corporate AV work and had a last minute session yesterday that went really well and everyone's super happy with! \n\nThis was only the second session I've done in this studio, the first was a semi nightmare which lay beyond my control (I had two hours to setup from scratch and record 4 tracks with a trio in a brand new room.. and I'm no Noah Needleman) although everyone's happy with it, it was somewhat disheartening to have my first session back in the studio be completely rushed and slapped together \n\nThis time I really wanted to prepare and took to digging in the server for a game plan. Shout outs to @chrissorem and @Eric Martin, I picked up 2 x m88s for vocal and double bass.... I'm super impressed and stoked with how these sound and I wouldn't have found them without your suggestions. (I also got a great deal on a M130, I haven't heard many people talk about them but it ruled on overhead)\n\nBut mainly, as someone who's not recording everyday, after a pretty average session a few weeks back, just reading this servers helped really refresh my perspective on why I'm doing what I'm doing and to go into the next session better prepared and focused. Very nice to have great feeling tracks right after and pretty average session in a new space\n\nBig thanks to everyone!!",

Everybody tells me the producer/band leader is this prolific asshole, constantly blowing up at people and impossible to please. The previous mixer had been mixing this thing for months/over a year and everyone was worn out/not getting results. I was really reluctant to take on the project for fear of being intimidated/failing to deliver.\n\nI've made a point of greeting the producer at every step with clear communication, enthusiasm, and an open mind. I genuinely love the music and have made a point of letting him know how much fun it's been to work on the stuff. And, similar to your story, we were basically approved on the first track within 4 mixes and the guy seemed really really happy.\n\nEveryone just said this guy was a hopeless asshole, but what I saw was a guy who was working so hard to bring a vision to life and just struggling to get there; self-financing, overseeing everything, etc... and it's fairly complex, hip hop and soul vibes with practically a full orchestra and 3 vocalists, so it's a lot to manage. Not trying to excuse the asshole behavior, but I see the frustration and I really wanted to highlight how much cool work he had done and that, without any fuss or needless back and forth, we would just get it where it needed to go. i tried to just think about how exciting it could be to finally hear these songs that've been bouncing around in his head actually come out of the speaker the way he imagined. We've got 7 songs almost done now and I've grown so much just from these attitude alignments i've picked up from spending time here.",

There\u2019s that extra gear that panic gives me that helps me lift the car off my leg or put up with Cian or do whatever else seemed impossible  at first glance. \n\nOnce I got out of college I spent my days selling clothes to the rich and thin before I got enough music work to leave that gig. We all go through the 40 hour week of day job and 60 hour week  of music making grind at one point of our career or another. And even when you get to quit the day job, almost everyone I know in our business has gone through what i call the \u201cCell service rack\u201d, where you get a couple of gigs and your rack gets filled with cool gear and then all of the sudden it\u2019s quiet for a few months and there gets to be less gear in those racks as you sell things to make rent. It looks like the changing meter of how much cell signal you have. There\u2019s no shame in that game. \n\nFor better or worse, it never ends either. I know 9 figure millionaires that are like \u201cmaybe I need to get rid of the fifth house in Aspen and free up some capital\u201d. There\u2019s nothing wrong with proactively taking stock of your life every once in a while and re evaluating which particular juice is worth the squeeze.",

I've thought about this a lot lately - the idea that things outside myself happening randomly might result in something beautiful, non-2nd-law, that there's a future for my kids. Been struggling with the death of a very close friend for the last 6 months, and I (for some reason, I'm not going to defend or explain it) started reading the works of Rene Gerard, the mimetic desire philosopher (\"Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind\" etc.) Previously I had read more stoic philosophy and resonated with that. Historically I come from a Christian perspective, though never bought into evangelicalism even as a kid.\n\nSo, something very bad happened, and it rocked me harder than anything has in a long time. Spoke at my friend's memorial, told part of his life story, and wept with hundreds of people. Didn't end for me there, though. Became very... depressed is probably the wrong term. Nihilistic is closer, but also wrong. Maybe just \"not hopeful\".\n\nDon't really have a logical conclusion for this, like I usually try to have, except to say: I still believe in beautiful things, people, experiences. Coffee while my kids chat with me in the morning. Sitting on the porch watching the sun rise earlier. And I do believe that all manner of things will be well in the end, and I choose to relax that tense knot inside myself, and I choose to move forward, and grow or decline, and move forward with as much grace as I can muster. I don't surf, and I find the overuse of the analogy annoying, but yes, to surf through the ups and downs instead of trying to master the waves.",

Cutting edge in creative pursuits, but classics in my personal taste. Specialist in my mode of expression, and generalist in my interests.\n\nThe more I subdivide and examine the question the more I find exceptions to everything. I am steeped in knowledge, but I seek wisdom above most things, which some philosophies would consider contradictory.\n\nThis Anais Nin quote comes to mind:\n\n> \"We do not grow absolutely, chronologically.

He was deep down a Fuzzmeasure rabbit hole and we were just moving, shooting, moving, shooting, moving back, shooting, etc, etc. When we'd finally make a change to the speaker position that seemed listenable, that was always the first song he would play to hear the speakers, followed by Back in Black. It's one of those few songs that's just cemented in my brain from hearing it so much -- like when you leave an image on a TV screen and it burns in -- that's that song in my ears.",

But I didn't get toward understanding these things until I'd tried and failed to feel fulfilled from other things (acquiring knowledge, living different experiences, hedonistic pursuits, status games). I also see other people having the same experience, whether they consciously know it or not. Both watching people fail in the ways I've experienced and seeing what seems to give people a deep sense of meaning.\n\nFeeling useful and productive and competent while connecting with other people is the current best way I can describe what is important to me. But that's pretty meta and I'm sure will evolve and refine.",

If only we had pure meritocracy here. Sam Fender put it really well this week with regards to the music industry so I won\u2019t go over stony ground, you can google his thoughts which I largely relate to.\n\nAs an individual I\u2019m horribly determined and annoyingly persistent when I have a goal in mind, as well as always balancing that with being the kindest person I can be towards others (sometimes to my detriment) and pretty much always in a headspace of bettering myself personally and professionally. This has generally been the key to many of the opportunities I\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s an English word for it, \u201cnous\u201d, which I think is similar to agency but also encompasses the notion of having \u201cgood sense\u201d. I quite like that as it\u2019s less about intelligence, and more about personal character. Just my two cents. As always firing off quick thoughts in a session break so I\u2019m sorry if my take is a bit disconnected.",

Into the coaxial cable that runs into the center console, for that true old analog gold plated warmth. Turned the windows and volume all the way up, then as I prepared to hit play. I was blanketed with the all to familar tension. That very same feeling from when I was going to have to sit next to one of the two dudes on the middle school basketball team. Who took as their daily task, to pay homage to ancestral animal social structures, by drowning any nearby male counter part with sack taps, donkey punches, and nail whip flicks. You just preemptively flinch at the inevitable pain from their onslaught. I hit play on a mix that is -5.8 lufs at peak. No proverbial donkey punch to my thighs this time. The song didn't overload the speakers at any point. As I heard the mix in my studio. I heard it here. The things I loved about it. I loved it here. The things I was unsure about. I was equally unsure about them here. My eyes welled up a bit with fulfillment and gratitude. It took me longer and cost more than I could of ever imagined, when I started this journey. But I got here. No longer do I have to worry about translation of the mix. I can focus all my worry on the feeling and vibe of the performace. I'm willing to let my ego have this one, this mix punches with any modern mix on earth. On any system. (Sounds killer on the Meta Ray Bans. And those speakers are rutheless honest. Ive heard alot of overloaded low end mixes on em) And back to the gratitude. I wanted to thank this place. I couldn't have done it without yall. I'd still be in a pitch black room looking for a switch that felt like it was hidden on the ceiling. Now back to work! Have a great day yall!!",

    "content": "This completely resonates with me. The business of music doesn\u2019t sit as well with me as the business of construction. There\u2019s a camaraderie and kinship in physical labour on construction projects, and an embodied intelligence in that world that offsets the subjective and (for me) atomised work of hours alone mixing.\n\nWhen I\u2019m doing construction work, I\u2019m also free to think objectively and from a distance about my audio engineering work.\n\nMost of all, something changes for me when I\u2019m being paid for musical \u201cwork\u201d that I\u2019m not entirely happy with. I\u2019ve discussed this privately with a few folks here, and it seems the relationship between music and its commodification is problematic for more than a few of us. Simply put, it\u2019s sometimes less enjoyable \u2014 though equally amazing \u2014 being paid for a passion.\n\nI couldn\u2019t recommend a construction or skilled trade career enough. It\u2019s incredibly flexible and offers a tonic to music careers: you know you can walk onto a site tomorrow and get paid quickly and well. It\u2019s always going to be around, and in my case, the certifications allow me to consider migrating to most economies globally as a skilled worker.\n\nConstruction allows me to be my own patron for my musical endeavours, and that feels really good.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a bigger debate here about how working in the upper echelons of the music industry feels long term \u2014 challenges, payoffs, economics, job security, retirement, healthcare, family life versus work life, and a world where socialising is networking.\n\nConstruction is a simpler engagement: competency, find a solution, do the work, go home.\n\nI came across @cian riordan discussing becoming a fireman on Conversations, and much of what you said, Cian, is exactly what I get from construction.\n\nI love how for you, though \u2014 instead of the firehouse bell calling, it was multiple Grammys!",

    "content": "On this note, I'll say that I LOVE these drives. My workflow in the past has basically been to buy a new 1GB SSD drive every few projects. When I had my setup on a laptop, this allowed me to always have access to projects I was working on the go (printing stems on the couch while watching TV? Yes please). In addition to using these SSDs, I'd always keep local backups with 'Sync Folders Pro' -- RIP Sync X -- on a cheaper, larger capacity USB drive. Being an anxious data archiver, I also signed up for Backblaze a few years ago as a cloud solution in case my studio burns down. Its a really great service, but the caveat they have with your drives is you *can* back up externals, they just need to be connected to your computer every 30 days. So I bought this monster USB3 hub and just had all of these fucking SSDs connected to my computer whenever it was setup at my studio. It worked fine for a few years, but I ran out of space again a few weeks ago and decided to futureproof mysetup a little bit. I ended up getting a thunderbolt Drobo. That way, I could have redundant storage for archived projects (which also gets uploaded to backblaze) but without having 16 drives on my desktop. Now I just have two of those samsung SSDs -- one work, and one as a backup. They run lightning fast and I get to keep having local backups in case I fuck the dog moving files around after a few glasses of wine. Then, when I run out of space, I just offload onto the Drobo and it's locally redundant, and also backed up on the cloud. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",

In my teaching I get them active early in the process.  Get them excited by the process, find out if there are any players in the group.  Get thme to jam, let the others engineer.  Rotate roles frequently.  Teach them fundamentals while they work.  Some people spend 3 hours teaching them how to coil a cable, and while this is important I always work it into a real environment.  Always, always ask what their favourite songs are and relate the teaching to that.  Got a room full of EDM kids?

(obviously outliers exist)\n\nI've literally seen art save lives. mental and emotional health is a necessity and music (even sound in general) I find is a key element. \n\na ridiculous amount of cultures (read:indigenous) placed immense value on the art in their culture..often as part of their spiritual beliefs. even colonists co-opted and modified songs to allow conquests though culture more easily.\n\nI think accessibility makes us think art isn't a necessity. it is. a lot of us would probably have lost our minds at this point (and I've seen that happen) if we didn't have it to lean on for various aspects. I'm not saying it should be #1 priority but I do think the inherent value we (the world) give art can directly affect how we value other things \n\nit's also the source of community and support for a lot of people and we are community based beings at our core  (though we can seperate to some extent).\n\nthe mindset things is also v interesting. being from Haiti I see American payment mindsets and European (a lot of both out there) and there's also more traditional ones that are more based in community - usually ones that survived colonialism to some extent. see:taino culture (mostly survived in pr, almost non existent in the other islands now). those are more focused on everyone getting there part fairly. the work is for the community not for yourself. while juxtaposition w the other mindset has flipped some folks' wayof working a lot of them are fine as is.\n\nthere's  o clear solution to the value of art thing. diff fields and different positions have to find ways of presenting value but I see that as a Consequence of the mentality we've adopted not a solution",

If the kid doesn\u2019t want it bad enough to have an initial \u201cfuck you, I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else this is MY LIFE\u201d response, they\u2019re simply not cut out for today\u2019s realities. Too many people leading too shitty of a life because a family member gave them the \u201cyou can do it!\u201d speech because you\u2019re \u201csupposed to be supportive of family even without cause\u201d. It\u2019s like sending them off to war with a tennis racket, and to me that\u2019s ultimately cruel. \n\nSo the next step is on the kid. If they come back 6 months later and are like \u201chey I know you said not to, but i hit YouTube and figured some stuff out and here\u2019s 30 tracks I got here that someone other than my mom or girlfriend says is pretty cool\u201d THEN I\u2019m all in, and matching their effort, and providing them every opportunity to grow and succeed. But if you need constant validation you\u2019re doing the right thing, and you can\u2019t fight through the first (or tenth) wave of people telling you not to do this, you REALLY don\u2019t belong in this game. It\u2019s way too much work for way too little reward unless the work IS the reward.",

So in that way, pre-internet pop culture is undervalued. We see this with iconic brands and reboots dominating Hollywood, non-hip hop samples and interpolations taking a bigger slice of pop music. \n\nRod sold pub, records, and likeness. Irving Azoff has not made a lot of bad decions, historically. I also wouldn't be so confident in making calculations based on a few press release numbers. Catalog deals of this kind are incredibly complicated and have so much nuance. Like, does a $1mil record deal mean something? Yeah, but to make any judgement about it, you'd need a lot more detail. Catalog deals are much more complicated than a record deal.\n\nLike I said, you might be right. But many good counterpoints too. Very interesting times. I definitely enjoyed reading your thoughts.",

That alien sound came about because extremely loose muscles create far less sympathetic intermodulation which sounds cleaner. It\u2019s the same as how a speaker makes your desk vibrate and create out of time interference pattern distortions. Muscle tension creates hard surfaces that do the same when singing and opera singers obsess over undoing this. This is a big reason why so many of your favorite vocalists are opioid and benzo addicts. It\u2019s not just culture. Downers are performance enhancing here. (Please don\u2019t get any ideas artists) \n\nThe modern pop voice is just maintaining that exaggerated opera looseness but with adaptations for the modern medium: English diphthongs instead of Latin ones, way less air in their lungs because the target is a foot from their mouth instead of 50 feet, and softened fricatives because a capsule right in front of the mouth harshly exaggerates fricatives. \n\nFrom a physics perspective it\u2019s the perfectly optimized way to sing in 2024. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance sounds like",

I pulled this from the article I was reading:\n\n\"Building 20 became a strange, chaotic domain, full of groups who had been thrown together by chance and who knew little about one another\u2019s work. And yet, by the time it was finally demolished, in 1998, Building 20 had become a legend of innovation, widely regarded as one of the most creative spaces in the world. In the postwar decades, scientists working there pioneered a stunning list of breakthroughs, from advances in high-speed photography to the development of the physics behind microwaves. Building 20 served as an incubator for the Bose Corporation. It gave rise to the first video game and to Chomskyan linguistics. Stewart Brand, in his study \u201cHow Buildings Learn,\u201d cites Building 20 as an example of a \u201cLow Road\u201d structure, a type of space that is unusually creative because it is so unwanted and underdesigned. (Another example is the Silicon Valley garage.) As a result, scientists in Building 20 felt free to remake their rooms, customizing the structure to fit their needs. Walls were torn down without permission; equipment was stored in the courtyards and bolted to the roof. When Jerrold Zacharias was developing the first atomic clock, working in Building 20, he removed two floors in his lab to make room for a three-story metal cylinder.\"",

When I get busy and she gets mad, it\u2019s because, historically, my business and fun big opportunities have meant she was going to have a lot of domestic labor and an overwhelming amount of loneliness to deal with. So now when I have a busy time coming up, I meal prep beforehand, I clean the house beforehand, I acknowledge that it\u2019s hard for her, I express tons of gratitude, and I always plan to block out some dedicated alone time for us afterwards. Anything to show that I understand the concessions that she\u2019s making and make my own big efforts to foresee what that means from her and minimize the negative consequences it could have. Maybe even make it something we can both look forward to.

Whether it's earnestly engaging with critiques, listening to what your partner is doing, listening to what your body is telling you, or opening yourself up the phenomena that surrounds you.\n\nListening is such a foundational skill. I don't know that listening as a practice receives a lot of attention, but I think we all recognize it's profound value in our lives.",

I\u2019ve taken the summer to work back on a construction site to get away from screens and endless inside days , get some vitamin d and all that . There\u2019s this kid who is on as a labourer . He\u2019s just pushing dust around all day with a broom and carrying whatever crap the supervisors tell him to move  just to keep him busy . He found out I mix and produce and has been sending me his songs and is waiting for me to give him the nod and set up a tracking session . He\u2019s pretty good and really young . Maybe he could be something . Dunno . But I do know when I walk past him on site looking bored as fuck and wondering why he\u2019s even here \u2026..he\u2019s just writing bars in his head , cause he spits them to me when we are done and all heading home . This sounds corny but it\u2019s so weird being an engineer and having all the skill and gear required to turn someone\u2019s vision into a reality . In the world of music you become their best friend and confidante . Those threesome stories lol , sometimes they get replaced with something deeper \u2026..stories about absent parents and betrayals by friends and lovers . These things are rarely discussed between men here , vulnerability is a weakness \u2026..so it\u2019s crazy how many times I\u2019ve been tracking and thought \u2026\u2026damn this is deep, im a part of a therapeutic process . Or just some made up shit about menages \ud83d\ude02. I will record this kid though . He needs it",

There an old Native American saying that laughter scares away fear . This is why clowns appear in our culture over and over again and have that curious ability to frighten us and entertain us . One of the things I love the most about being back in construction for the summer is the 24/7 ripping the piss out of everyone and everything especially including oneself. . Imo Considering we know Nothjng of the life after this one , except that when we pass on all@our hopes and fears are evaporated like we never had them at all \u2026..I will not waste my life in fear . . When thoughts are not our own creation but discoveries we stumble upon shared around amongst humanity like presents (or curses ) and these thoughts precipitate emotions we then call our own \u2026..it\u2019s easy to become infected with the assumption that these things are who you are . I really believe they are not . Iwe are something much more profound than any ideas or emotions we borrow from each other . There\u2019s a serendipity a coincidence a beatification , a story unfurling we are all involved in .

Sam and a few other engineers brought it up and instead of listening or acknowledging something was strange, people got defensive and claimed that they couldnt hear or see the issue (including Colt and Darrel Thorp \u2014 who just engineered an advertisement video for them.) A rep from Lauten then chimed after all that and said that there was in fact a limiter built into the mic\u2026 which they don\u2019t mention anywhere in the specs of the mic or any of the adverts. The mic could sound killer (the vid with Brad Wilk is awesome)\u2026 but engineers need to know what their tools are doing\u2026 and in this case, Lauten fucked the dog on that front.",

I also liked what he had to say on the information he's unintentionally prescribed in past live videos and the Peter Attia quote -- many times i've wondered if a new engineer hears \"I don't compress\" wihtout any context and goes ok, compression is cancelled, but really that was a thing specific to Jon's brain at that time. though yea, a lot of people could get away with compressing *less* lol",

The bad experiences I\u2019ve had have been all female perspective stuff - male producers/engineers being dickheads and talking down to me like I\u2019m a child or over complicating things so I can\u2019t keep up. \nFrom those experiences, I\u2019ve educated myself (currently studying music production at university), I empathise with musicians when I\u2019m producing - currently working on my first production project with an artist and her band and she has no knowledge of anything production but she wants to know what I\u2019m doing so I explain it in smaller bites so it doesn\u2019t freak her out as I know what it\u2019s like to be freaked out by it \ud83d\ude02 \nOpen communication is the BEST BEST thing for me!

It took me about a year to pull in enough income from mixing and spotify streams where I could stop living off savings and only on music income. \n\nBut, It IS so expensive to live here, and I like to do things. typical night out is like $80 after drinks and ubers. Gas is $80. An egg sandwich is $16 lol. The constant worrying of if i was going to make enough that month got to me, so of a couple months ago, I returned to a freelance software engineering gig 3 days a week. Never been happier. A _lot_ of people in LA are doing the same: _side hustles are your friend_ . \n\nAnother thing i'd add is when you first move here, try to combine your studio and living expenses. Studio spots here start at like $1800 a month and go up from there. I live in a beautiful house in silverlake with roommates where I have a room, my own bathroom, _and my own studio_ in the furnished garage for $1300. Try to get something like that.",

Maybe I need to live with them for longer and get used to it.\n\nLast week was the first time that I was able to sit in front of an Atmos setup that was meant for music (aka: not in a movie theater) and really get the full musical experience. In fact, I got to sit in front of *three* different Atmos rigs in three different (treated) rooms that evening and two of them were undoubtedly set up as good as they could have possibly been (One was a PMC showroom and the other built and tuned with their input). While the speakers themselves were impressive and very capable, the actual experience felt pretty disjointed. There was a pronounced feeling of phasi-ness that I didn't like.\n\nIt was great hearing these records on a rig that probably cost $250k, but my big takeaway was that they felt disjointed and odd. Even when sitting in the sweet spot.\n\nPerhaps my opinion will change with more exposure, but I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the time and effort. I will add, though, that half the mixes we heard were up-mixed from old stereo recordings with minimal track counts and only two of them were modern productions.",

Recording took us 7 days and they still needed to add synths and bass fot some of the songs after that (side note: the production wasn't finished by the time we tracked, so I edited everything I had - 10 songs, none of them with less than 5 minutes. It was the band's first time in the studio, also, and had to edit lots of drums and bass stuff). After doing a first pass, I sent them the multitracks they asked for, to track the rest of their stuff with their producer (a colleague of mine). The next 8 months were spent waiting on their files to start mixing (this was supposed to last 1/2 months, max). When I finally got the files, you have no ideia how messy the project turned out (track names, bounce mistakes, ultrapocessed tracks with artifacts - even the ones we've tracked at the studio before, audible edit points,... all you can imagine going wrong at this point), so it took me a bunch of time to organize everything in a way that I could work with what I've got (going back and forth asking the producer for some files that didn't even get to me or asking if there was the possibility to get some of the tracks dry, without processing or fx - keep this in mind).\n\nNeedless to say, when I was ready to start mixing, I was already overwhelmed and tired of it, and I knew I still had a long way to go...\n\nFirst version took me probably too long to get right (2 months, approx., working on other projects that got scheduled on those 8 months) and I've sent it before I went on a few days vacation.",

I'm approaching the end of a self-imposed 3 month break from alcohol and as I near the finish line I don't feel as if I'm in any hurry to return to where I was.\n\nI've been a casual drinker for over 15 years and recently have found that even 1-2 drinks the night before were leaving me feeling like shit in the morning, so I opted to remove them from the equation and see how I felt after my trial period.\n\nNo surprise, but it's been a positive one. I'll still drink on occasion, but it feels great not defaulting to that habit. It's probably been the confluence of several factors in my life, but right now I feel as good as I've ever been. I feel present and in-tune with the world around me and I think I'd be far less effective if I hadn't taken this break.",

My problem solving brain is always on and it's hard to turn it off. It's really easy to fall into one's work and feel guilty or bad when you're not working even though you should be or have to be. Gotta just accept and walk away and not beat yourself up for needing to be unproductive. The bigger picture frame is a day or 3 or 10 of doing \"nothing\" is going to be a bigger payoff in the long run than in the short term trying to superhero through it half-in and potentially doing shitty work which could have compounding unintended long-term effects. \n\nGet high, have a drink, go for a walk, get out of town, watch a show, cook a meal...do nothing.",

    "content": "Hi, yes so......within the genres I\u2019m most involved in currently hip/hop , drill and rnb the samples we choose and the patterns we create for these samples are all \u201ctrendy \u201c in a sense that it\u2019s important in our genres to be seeking to present new sounds and patterns that others catch onto . This would be being the new wave . It\u2019s vital in uk street music to be a creator of the wave / up on the new wave .....to garner attention . This dates back to jungle....where the producer/engineers were pioneering completely new sounds and rhythms via sampler technology midi and sampled breakbeats (amen , funky drummer etc ) . When a snare backbeat transitions from the use of a snare to instead a rimshot......or a particular clap sample.....and that track blows up, the wave moves . If you a year later release a track with the old snare on the backbeat instead of the rim .....that\u2019s dated . The same goes for the other percussions, the bass sounds (eg 808 / Moog in intro/bridge combi ) .....and the patterns . So this is why In twelve months most of the productions these artists are dithering over , will be out of date. It\u2019s just silly imo. Music is moving so fast and is ultimately so disposable at the mo holding onto it like some sort of special Tolkien esque ring is really just a vanity. Personally I\u2019d venture this is also the essence of what makes pop music trends discernible . That\u2019s just my opinion tho with respect to these genres. My overall goal is to record and mix work like rumours. Smokey , earthy and nourishing . A bit like @popaganda.  s last work .\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

When i was at uni i used to run the rehearsal rooms attached to a pro recording studio (claim to fame ...wet wet wet\u2019s all around me lol)...so i could just sit in on the studio sessions once I\u2019d booked in the practice bands in the other part of the building. . After uni I\u2019d do stage management/engineer assisting  at local venues in bristol volunterrring just to get experience......i did the wailers, ozomatli, pharcyde.....tons of two tone ska....while volunteering in dj workshops for local kids.....and up to today i always do some free stuff for rappers and singers in my area...because (and this is where i think mainstream often misunderstand rap lyrics).....it helps youngers express themselves and get shit off their chest....and off the streets.....and focuses their minds on ambition and change. In this way i think music is about grace....and as you said @BatMeckley  ...magic. What it brings into peoples lives and how it affects lives. The money i can take it or leave it....but the music i have to have. The most enriching musical experiences i can look back on have nothing to do with how much money was transacted",

    "content": "Sure! But probably not for the reasons many would think, it\u2019s not just about having a lot of low end, but it\u2019s character and how it sits and feels:\n\n1. Bad For Me by Stacy Ryan (Castelli mix/Becker master) \u2014 so much lows to be for this type of vibe, and like .05 db more in 200ish area would be too much. LOVE how it sits on the edge there, but I\u2019m a big Jon fan so no surprise\n\n2. Disco Break 2 by Brasstracks (Castelli Mix/Becker master) \u2014 crazy good and deep transients with a wonderfully articulate but big low end. Quite dynamic, maybe slightly on the edge there so great to study translation to streaming. Recommended to me by the wonderful @YianniAP \n\n3. 30 for 30 - T Shyne. Not quite sure who mixed it, but I actually DON\u2019T like the lows, or really the overall mix that much as an engineer but there is such a wonderful energy to me, this thing played before a sports game or a workout is it. So I have it here to remind myself that not everything has to be amazing sonically to feel great. Actually don\u2019t like the low end on this at all, but the record still hits for me. Told @alexstein this was on the warm up list\u2026he was like \u201cwhy??\u201d haha. Because I think my job is to love records for what they are and understand why they work, hopefully be more of themselves, not some target curve that\u2019s ideal to me. and this is a great example of something like that\n\nAlso just have to mention that \u201cTattoos\u201d by Georgia Webster is on there\u2026probably my favorite vocal I\u2019ve ever heard. @YianniAP mix Nathan master, I cannot look away from the vocal and the mid density is perfection to me",

Mine is more focused on how I want to hear (or rather deeply understand how I'm hearing) every day as close to consistent as possible, given we are human of course.\n\nMy 2 cents (which of course is just my experience): \n\nSome sort of routine before you work. Mine is that I wake up almost exactly at the same time every day, will work out at similar times (if possible), literally eat the same thing basically every day before during the work day, coffee at similar times, have  the same routine when I sit down to start work. Not all of that is possible or useful for everyone, but I think we can all find something that would focus us in a way that's useful and ablet to be put into practice for us.\n\nTruly I find it helps a lot. We are physical beings, how our systems and bodies interact can definitely matter, especially in our ability to be available to the music.\n\nThat said, sometimes things happen and you gotta go. You will be tired, stressed, whatever. You have to do excellent work under those conditions too, it might be the most important skill if we are being honest about making a career of this. So training specifically for when you feel rough is definitely something I personally find important.  Which is where physically training helps, it's a way to force yourself into (fake) adversity and train response\n\n@Slow Hand I know you know all this, just my experience",

For example, if (intention) is what you are going for trying (suggestion) may work well. But if (a different angle) is what you are going for, (a different suggestion) can be another thing you can try. This, I do more often as a producer. As casual feedback, I don\u2019t do this very often other than people I am close to.",

Many snorkelers and scuba divers are familiar with this marine sound, since the crustacean appears along most ocean shorelines and reefs, and in estuaries. It has a staticlike sound that permeates the entire underwater region, and it generates a signal with its large claw that can meet or exceed 200 dB underwater\u2014a sound-pressure level equivalent to around 165 dB in air. With every 6 dB change representing a doubling or halving of intensity, we can compare the shrimp output to a symphony orchestra, which may generate loud moments peaking around 110 dBA. Indeed, the lowly, unsophisticated shrimp will not be outdone even by the Grateful Dead, a rock group whose concerts have been measured at levels exceeding 130 dB. Get this, Deadheads: the shrimp is louder by close to a factor of five\u2014all that without a huge stack of stage speakers!\u201d",

    "content": "And sorry to bang on about this, but something that is critical to the audio quality on a record that is way out of most pro-audio people\u2019s view is the state of the cutting lathe being used to do the master cut. Many people working in audio have never even seen such a machine. They are complicated - there are techs who work on consoles who won\u2019t touch cutting lathes. IMO the best lathes were made by Neumann in the 70s/early 80s, and that was a long time ago. You have a TON of electronics and mechanics that need to be refurbished / restored to get the lathe to make some great cuts. Some engineers are cutting on some nicely restored systems and some are using some OLD stuff which should have been pulled for maintenance decades ago. Imagine if 50% of the records today were mastered on 50 year old loudspeakers with blown drivers and mismatched crossovers. We might notice.",

This comes a lot easier if you have close friends in the same lane looking for jobs, I've seen people have their \"double(s)\" move in with them for a limited time too, with the intention of them soaking in exactly all you do.\n\nOnce my double(s) started doing pretty well, we started hiring more specialized people, and the doubles could then oversee their work, feedback etc - early on I would always be part of this, then slowly phase myself out.\n\nWhat I wish I would have done earlier would have been to hire a producer/overseer/manager/'my boss' - someone with a bit more skin in the game/responsibility, and who keeps you in line if you start wavering. \n\nAgain, I didn't love the setup of 10 and dissolved it eventually - as a creative it's easy to feel like you built a house/efficiency machine and one day you wake up and it's a prison that's not as flexible as you want. That's another thing I'm trying to keep in mind (I'm putting together a new similar team for this fall) - how do you keep the team agile and ready to shift when priorities shift? It could be as easy as accepting a little bit more churn & letting people go when they don't fit what's going on, but it's hard to let go of people you've trained and know well. I felt a friendship connection with my entire team, in hindsight I think that was a mistake too.\n\nThose are some thoughts haha - what have you found so far? Are you experiences lining up with mine? What kind of roles are you hiring for?",

He told me all about his experience and how impressive he is. Then proceeded to tell me he \u201cheard from a friend\u201d that my artist (I\u2019m her manager and her engineer) sounds bad live and that he should be her live engineer because he is so good at it and really wants to.\n\nReally really highlights how much being a considerate, mature, and pleasant conversationalist can get you. This guy might be super talented (he had some cool experience) and I actually would have kept in touch and been excited for the connection if he was a good hang! But he came across green, arrogant, and needy all at the same time. Terrible look.\n\nAnyway! Be cool, everyone! Play the long game.",

It\u2019s not so much a defeatist attitude, that there\u2019s no point in even trying. It\u2019s a little more that I may never be able to fully grasp certain things - being a being of (very, lol) finite intelligence - but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no merit in seeking to grow my understanding of them all the same.",

A song called \u201cInto the Blue\u201d by an \u201cartist\u201d named Sienna Rose came on in my gf\u2019s car and I consciously thought she\u2019s got a great voice and that\u2019s a great chorus. Had her text it to me and I liked it on Spotify. Later found out it\u2019s suspected to be AI. Most of the AI music I\u2019ve heard has been sort of mechanically impressive but simultaneously some level of dog shit. This song actually got me out in the wild and I liked it. Most convincing AI dupe I\u2019ve heard. If it is in fact AI. Even the social media seems fabricated but it\u2019s still pretty convincing. Apparently some celebrity used it in a post too and it\u2019s having a viral moment. That artist profile has over 3 million monthly listeners.",

I've mixed the song this way because its how I hear things, and most changes tend to deviate away from that -- and thats OK! But just know thats where I'm coming from on most heavy-handed revisions. When I send back the revision, i will put my notes in bold/color next to their notes... usually explaining what I did in vague detail. If it was a note like you're referring to above where I don't really agree with it, I'll make the adjustment best I can, say that I don't agree with it, but here it is anyways. If it's something I feel really strongly about -- I'll still execute, but be a little more forceful in my language saying something like 'I really don't think this is a good idea, but hear it anyways'. You want the band to know that you're open to feedback but that you also have skin in the game and care about the end product. This is something that gets easier down the line once you build up a rapport.",

I'm not in the stratosphere in terms of accreditation, but I'm comfortably making a healthy living, am married, have a child, and own a house. If I relied on big breaks, I'd be absolutely nowhere. 99% of my success has come from rubbing shoulders with the right people and finding opportunity that way. A night out drinking with friends leads to meeting other people who you stay in touch with. Pretty soon they'll need help with something and then off you go, that leads to the next. 75% of what I work on is smaller potatoes... most of it will never get heard, but it pays most of my salary. And the 25% of work I have that makes it through the filters has all come through connections I've made through smaller gigs. Networking is really key. And if you're a social person, it's even better as it'll help offset the time spent alone in a soundproof room, pulling your hair out over a stupid kick drum sound.",

Did anyone ever realize that that's simply your eyes aliasing? It seems the \"sample rate\" of our eyes is too slow to catch up with a wheel spinning at highway speeds. We're perceiving the tire after it's already done almost a full revolution and we see it in the position *behind* where it once was. Hence the perception of spinning backwards. It's the same thing with audio. If the sample rate isn't fast enough it reads the super-high frequencies as being lower than they actually are.",

Lots of exciting and novel tools exploding right now that are threatening to replace certain modes of illustration, writing, programming, and audio.\n\nIt seems likely that certain roles for creators are going to be diminished. Photography was a huge blow to illustrators when it emerged. Portraiture and photo-realism used to be the domain of painters. But when those skills became trivially easy to replicate the next generation of painters had to pivot into something else that played to the unique strengths of painting. I can't say what the actual causation is for sure, but the entire 20th century was dominated by abstract representation in painting, as one example of what that shift might look like.\n\nPerhaps as creators our domains will need to shift into something else. Something more taste-driven and creative.\n\nThese AI tools can emulate pre-existing material well, but they still lack creativity, taste, and informed judgement. So I think the roles that are likely to remain (until another massive development) are matters of taste and curation. Somebody still needs to steer these tools to make something useful or novel.",

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

    "content": "@Jeremy Klein some thoughts on home ownership... my wife and I have done pretty well on our house. We've got a large one for our kids (3 kids, my dad also lived with us when we moved into our current house, so 6 people total) and we do plan to downsize if / when they move out. Current rate is 2.65 (I got a good deal, and spent a little to buy the rate down at the time - payoff on that was like 7 years).\n\nWe kept the old house, and for about 6 months I considered renting it out. I did not enjoy being a landlord, though, and abandoned mission quickly on that. I'd definitely go the prop manager route if I was to even attempt it. Portland rental scene ain't great though.\n\nPrices in Portland specifically... if you chart them out, the more expensive houses aren't doing great, some zip codes aren't doing great, but in general anything in that \"starter home\" range that's also near a decent school has done pretty well.\n\nIn terms of investing in S&P 500 or total market or whatever, I think you can pretty easily see that they're more correlated than not these days. That was the big thing about the housing crash - RE crashed along with the market crash. In the past those could be decorrelated, so \"diversification\" worked in your favor. Housing crashing? Rebalance into stocks. Stocks crashing? Rebalance into RE or REITs. Truthfully, though, that's just not the case anymore. Nothing is safe \ud83d\ude42\n\nI think there's also some psychology here. You can run the numbers, and they do pencil out at times in favor of renting (and I do intend to rent at some point in the future, though I've mostly owned a house). However, being a bit \"house poor\" sure is a good way to do some forced saving. For years my wife and I paid an extra $1k a month toward our house, and had a very low rate, and we really saw our net value go up quickly. It was nice.\n\nOne final thought... you often make money on RE when you buy, not when you sell. Place I'm in (which is in a nice part of Portland up on the Alameda ridge) wasn't selling, and I offered $80k under list, and got it. Put $80k into it in improvements (had an ugly small kitchen) and it's worth a lot more now.\n\nOverall tho? I'm mixed. Bad neighbors suck and you feel stuck with them. Maintenance is a killer (3% a year is about right IME). Sometimes you just don't want to deal with problems. But then... renting sucks too in other ways. Choose your poison! \ud83d\ude42",

In the case of MWTM, if you write to them and say \"Hey, I disagree with this and will be cancelling my subscription,\" they might notice. If 500 users do it, they certainly will. If they lose 5000 subscribers, maybe they'd rethink it.\n\nIf their user base isn't passionate about the issue, MWTM doesn't have any financial incentive to change what they're doing. Spotify and the other streamers have Chris Brown, and I can't imagine the amount of pushback they would need before pulling his catalog from their services.\n\nAs Noah said, everyone can vote with their wallet and decide where to focus their attention on a personal level.",

To someone who doesn't work much with other people to whom success is largely predicated on their lone creative genius maybe the question of balance is neither here nor there.\n\nHowever, if you are on a team, are a leader, teacher, or coach suddenly you are on the hook with others and the performance of the group matters. The highest achievement, future funding, drawing in more talent, etc... might all come down to the performance of the group. Would it then be wise to be so laissez-faire about undermining the intrinsic motivation / confidence of others? What if an unintended consequence of that attitude is less actual human connection?\n\nLast thought I had is how do we know the truth of someone else's potential?

    "content": "Quite a bit.\n\nMy learning is less music-focused these days, but I budget a lot of time for self-development and continued study.\n\nSometimes it's  20 min a day in a technical book that I'm reading. I move slowly and make sure I understand before I move on. It may take two months to complete, but I'm steady with it and I do a little bit most days. It's common for me to transcribe notes from high-density talks that I want to learn from and revisit them often over the span of a week. I'm constantly printing out my notes and reading material so that they're easy to revisit throughout the week.\n\nI'm currently taking a project management course through MIT, which has been great. It's uncommon for me to do formal schooling these days, but this is work related and a direct application to my future capabilities that we thought would be beneficial for the company.\n\nWhen I buy a new plugin (rare) I set aside time to go through it and turn every knob and try each feature to see what it's capable of. Learning a tool on the spot is a good way to kill the creative flow, so I do the exploration up-front when possible.\n\nOften I'll have ideas for novel ways to use a tool (layering distortion, for example) and I'll set aside two hours to explore it and see what I find.\n\nThat said, I think my day-to-day may be quite different from a lot of folks here. My eggs aren't all in the business and pressures of record production, and so I rarely find myself buried in such commitments. I tend to keep \"normal\" business hours these days and keep a hard separation between my commitments and my leisure.\n\nIn fact I'd say that I'm actively structuring my life so that I can retain my leisure and don't find myself overwhelmed with commitments. That's a whole other story, though.",

It probably hits harder because my dad is around the same age and has Parkinson\u2019s it's not the same but\u2026 \n Dave always seemed like a genuinely good person, and I\u2019m grateful for how he tried to spread knowledge.\n\nI\u2019m with Cian on the interview quality \u2014 a lot of them were just awkward (the Justin Meldal-Johnsen one is a perfect example), and the absolute worst part was Herb. In the end, his stupid ego kinda killed the show. It was really annoying how he kept interrupting all the time and talking way more than Dave or the guest, about random shit that had nothing to do with the conversation. Fucking terrible.\n\nBUT I can\u2019t forget that back in the day, Pensado\u2019s Place was one of the very few places where you could actually see your mixing heroes talk about making records. Even when the interviews were pretty bad like 85% of the time, I still had great moments watching Eric Valentine, Tchad Blake, JMJ, Ken Andrews, etc\u2026 and I learned some useful stuff too.\n\nI\u2019m from a small village in Northwest Spain (BTW, I heard Pensado has family roots here), and I had zero access to any info about how real records were made. So when I discovered Pensado\u2019s Place, it was huge for me. Big thanks to Dave!! And I wish him nothing but the best in this sad new chapter. Good people and love for this art will always win for me, no matter the flaws. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "content": "Not sure if anyone else had this experience, but I had literally never heard of Joshua Slone until the other day when everyone was posting about his album release. First of all, great record / artist. I checked out his Spotify and saw that he had no music out before this album. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but my understanding is that he got some tik tok traction then went on the road with Zach Bryan before any of his stuff was out? Was so stoked to see the amount of excitement around an artist\u2019s first release (which is so sick that his first release was an album as well). This might be a hot take, but I think I\u2019m a pretty big fan of the way tik tok has impacted music discovery. Obviously it\u2019s not perfect or going to satisfy everyone, but it\u2019s pretty awesome that all the doors are wide open. And I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a bigger interest in songs, writing, lyrics, etc. From what I\u2019ve heard, it sounds like people got to know some of these Joshua Slone songs well enough to be singing along at his live shows, and I would dare to attribute that to the fact that his lyrics are literally on the screen in his videos. Who knows, maybe that\u2019s all bull shit lol, but wanted to throw it out there. Would love to hear y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts.",

But honest, open communication is almost always the best solution. \n\nThe only other thing I'll add regarding @Zack Hames's initial question is that I find it super valuable to continue to do all kinds of different roles. If I've mostly been programming and finishing productions, I'll take some time to write a song and sing it myself, so I stay \"in shape\" with writing and recording vocals. If I don't do something myself, how can I empathize with someone? My communication style is always one of \"I know how you're feeling and you can trust me because I've done it a ton.\"",

James* era Aphex Twin. He's super handy with Max/MSP too.\n\nIt's interesting to see him evolve over the years, because at this point he's very much also a Nashville singer-songwriter with a fantastic voice.\n\nHis *Mulitply* record has had \"instant classic\" status for me ever since it came out in 2006 because it's basically Otis Redding heavily filtered through the Warp Records catalog, which is *right* in my sweet spot.",

I agree with your perspective.....I think that we as humans have boundless potential for invention and ingenuity (its just convenient to some that we aren\u2019t educated to see ourselves this way when we are in school).....and its unquestionable IMO that the aesthetic pendulum of \u201caugmented/artificial\u201d processes will swing back hard the other way as soon as it reaches saturation. I was stood on a building site in Kings Cross with an old bricklayer under a bricked archway he was renovating.....and he explained how his trade was dying ...that no-one built brick arches anymore...its all breeze blocks and cladding....and we looked out across london and all the new buildings going up around us and he was right. Not a real brick in sight. One day someone will come up with the idea of using stone and bricks again for hi end projects and stone masonry and bricklaying will be considered art. The yin and yang of our desires i suppose\n\nWhat turned you off Brett out of interest?",

He\u2019s currently discussing fractals and the nature of our perceptions as being at one order in a fractal , and that colours and sounds don\u2019t exist in the real world , I love this .This gets to the heart of the science and the magic of what we do as musicians and engineers imo . He describes colours and sounds  as oscillations, and perceived harmonics as synchronous oscillations in the brain  . One of the things I geek out on is as engineers  is we get to learn and play with psycho acoustics and physics between  our and other peoples perceptions. ( Buddhism teaches pretty much the same thing Bach is describing here , it describes these things s aggregates . ) . This attention to how we perceive sound is what struck me about you and spiders discussion on lwmr ruari . It\u2019s curious and inspiring imo that somewhere between the maths , the physics and the deception of our perception , we are all capable of communicating something we all seem to be able to share In , a connection in a vast array of unreal oscillations .",

I was on duty, and spent 3 and a half hours troubleshooting it. Eventually it got to the point where I had tried everything that I could do and had to devise a workaround that would at least let the studio limp along until our tech team could take the room offline on Monday morning to fix it.",

    "content": "@austenballard  On a similar thread I try to frame those situations like this. There\u2019s no point worrying about something because if you can\u2019t change it why worry and if you can, change it so you don\u2019t have too. A huge simplification but something I find helpful with dealing with tough times in a studio. \n\nYou can get that weird moment in a session when something goes wrong  usually the best course of action is to be a positive and hopeful force for the band or artist to rely on. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this sorted as quickly as possible and get back to work\u201d\nDeep down I don\u2019t think anyone really thinks you\u2019re responsible for what ever happened, they\u2019re just looking for a solution. Except of course Trevor, Trevor knows you did it and he\u2019s mad. \n\nLol but really sessions are emotionally intense situations and places and sometimes that can boil up in interesting ways.",

Having started as an intern, becoming an assistant after a few sessions and only later into engineering new projects and running my own sessions at the studio I work at nowadays, it's really clear to me that is you succeed at being a good assistant, people will trust you and you will be blessed with an opportunity to learn and evolve in a totally different and better way... I still assist some of the my colleague senior engineers and engineers that come to the studio for their own sessions, and I'm always eager to be on that spot... If you're that good and keep your mouth shut, you can only win - either by knowing the coolest people in the industry, by learning the craft, by learning how different people do their thing, different mindsets... And you REALLY learn what it takes for a session to run smoothly and for people to be comfortable in the studio, which will probably be the best skill you'll ever develop in this career... \n\nBeing an assistant is great, and all the assistants I know are usually the coolest people to hang with (and yes, I'm including myself, of course \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude02)",

Wherever it got into any perceived sense of entitlement , was off track as the core of the question was about leveraging and better pay/benefits for the successful elite (nothing to do with people striving to get there ) . It wasn\u2019t a question about working hard.....or having talent......or how to share a pie and how much pie there is ......that\u2019s all a given in the original discussion I referenced that was between two Grammy winning engineers.  It was a discussion about marketing and the idea of engineers  leveraging for more as a community looking forwards . One  platform was mentioned here earlier that I have experience with.......and they are definitely driving value down with their marketing.  Through the history of time workers have had to fight for more (pay/benefits/better working conditions / contracts ) and imho that\u2019s a legitimate and beneficial force in society. Noam Chomsky describes a point at which society collapses is when the imbalance of the societal structure is such that the vast majority of the workforce can no longer afford to live . In the uk we are currently experiencing strikes across many services/industries. It\u2019s not really my way to say if they are write or wrong ......but I think the concept of unionising and leveraging for \u201cfairer/better :::::whatever you like \u201c is legitimate not entitled or moany  . The suffragettes did it ......I digress. I think IME it\u2019s a fair observation that people employed on the business side of the music business in the big music companies in the  uk work with the expectation that this will result in take home regular pay, without fear of non-payment , working with full benefits re\u2019 holiday pay , maternity pay , etc etc.......",

I understand there are statistics about how this is the best time in the history of human kind to live, but I find that talking point to be pedantic and just plain insensitive. This is a server filled with more successful people than truly struggling people, and the world is the exact opposite. It's hard to hear from the former that things are ok.  \n\n\n2) it's absolutely ok *not* to want children. There seems to be a one way street of judgement (not just here but socially) where the people who've chosen a life without children are indifferent to those who have / want, but most parents or want-to-be parents instantly throw shade to anyone who chooses not to be...and in most cases even towards people who nature has chosen for them, my partner being one of them. \n\nIt's like all cat people *also* being dog people, but dog people just despising cats, but way less funny. \n\n3) you don't need, and absolutely shouldn't have, children in order to find some transcendence within your life.",

When the production company wants world-class sound, and it's your job to create the budget...   knowing that sample libraries can only take you so far is key to explaining to the client WHY they should allocate budget for humans. \"I can create this with just the computer, and it will sound great....  but it won't sound like your example.  There's a real VALUE to humans playing the music and that extra 10% of the quality you're looking for requires a studio session with real players\" \n\nInstant path to budget upgrade.  Suddenly the expense makes sense to them.  Now you get the pleasure of hiring all your friends and deliverying something that sounds top notch...  and you can take the client on a mind-blowing field-trip.  It took me years to learn this trick...   clients don't want to pay mountains of money extra for you to sit in front of your computer and massage CC lanes....  and if they have a mindblowing time in the studio and the track sounds ALIVE?  You win six different ways.",

Usually the questions don't follow from, or relate to each other which ends up with the \"knowledge\" being disembodied surface level data at best and it doesn't seem like it's even relevant to them  that what they're learning is applicable to the real world\n\nThis has gotta be one of the worse ways to learn imo, typically you'll see the same person asking the same question a week later with no memory of what they'd learnt or why it's even relevant, there's zero chance of this kind of approach getting you \"knowledge\" that you can actually implement which should be the goal\n\nI like Andrejs post a lot, esp when it seems like the bulk of the world is loosing their value in doing the more difficult and meaningful things in life, along with their attention spans",

I definitely got a lot of other things out of my Master's program (skills, network, artistic development, my Protools perpetual license, etc) and the degree would qualify me for certain academic jobs if I were to ever go that direction in the future.

I'm looking at several avenues for doing this, including an education degree, a research based music education degree, or a popular music degree. \n\nItay and I both know there are a ton of popular music programs out there that aren't worth it but just thought we'd ask if there are any that are!

Could we have a bigger audience by now if we just decided to produce the best most clickable content? Probably. Maybe I\u2019m turning into a crotchety middle aged man but I do think there\u2019s something to be said for musicians actually being able to play and singers actually being able to sing without help from computers.

AVOID anthuriums and calatheas. we have 50+ plants in our home (my lady works with plants for her job) and we've never been able to keep either one alive, even from Easy Plant (so sorry @kylem we love you and appreciated it though). I've also heard Orchids are on this difficult list. The company cool though and offered to replace it free of charge, so now we have a money tree and it's fantastic. Looks really cool and is thriving. We're fairly organized with our plant collection so I have a long list I can share, but I'd suggest a syngonium, fiddle leaf, philodendron, or monstera. Favorites are philodendron billitiae or monstera thai constelation. both are kind of rare and eye catching, but not wildly difficult to maintain.",

The reality is, for a lot of artists, we may be their first recording experience, their first record, etc and they\u2019ll grow a LOT during and move on and grow. I think this was mentioned In the Conversations podcast. So for me sometimes it\u2019s letting certain things go that aren\u2019t going to change in someones performance and trying to make it work. I did a pretty emo influenced record recently, and the vocalist isn\u2019t the best. I tried to give him tons of vocal tips and train him the best I could, and it ultimately made it so much harder to record him because it sounded so unnatural and unemotional. We ended up using a lot of earlier scratch takes for certain songs (and they feel super good/relatable/captivating even though it\u2019s maybe nasally) and then using particularly emotional driven takes at the very end. I think there\u2019s a balance of being honest/giving feedback and being delicate/not destructive in your response. Also, @oaklandmatt , your point about learning 10 different ways to say something needs to be better, is spot on.",

I can always HDMI I figure if I need the extra real estate.\n\nThe only acustica plug I run regularly is Ruby 2 - seems to cause pretty drastic spikes on the CPU short term in Ableton (running rosetta mode and VST3 by the way) but then it levels out.  In general I've been super impressed with the performance vs my desktop.  I'd say for my mixes it runs maybe 80% as well on large projects (75+ tracks, lots of processing) which was more than I was expecting.  Smaller projects and productions and softsynths it absolutely chews through compared to my desktop.\n\nWas just trying out a little mix in Studio One just on the 14\" and it felt very cramped to me.  I think it'd be hard to completely mix at this resolution but again it probably has more to do with what I'm used to.  Would definitely recommend a separate display if you are going to be doing all your work on it.",

After moving to the states I found more restaurant work but kept it to only fri/sat/sun and tried to focus the rest of the week to build contacts and do studio stuff. I got super lucky with my boss who was also in the music thing and very understanding about calling out. It eventually got to the stage where I had to call out like 3 weekends in a row so I made the jump to doing the studio stuff full time. So far it\u2019s been working out and I\u2019ve been lucky to keep a good basis of projects, supplementing quiet periods with studio build stuff. It can be super stressful relying 100 percent on the music thing and it\u2019s ultimately different strokes for diff folks. I\u2019ve seen some people who get really burnt out taking music stuff that they don\u2019t like to pay the bills and conversely I\u2019ve seen people getting burnt out doing other stuff that\u2019s not music getting effected in the same way.

    "content": "If you\u2019re confident enough to hit various scales spanning 2+ octaves in each hand (in sync and delayed/one at a time) and you have a decently strong level of piano sight reading ability, then I\u2019d say a piano teacher might be worth lessons every so often if it\u2019s affordable because I\u2019d say you\u2019re starting to max the limits of your ability to assess your execution of technique (you\u2019ll want someone to actually watch how you move, see where you should go, and give you specific cues on what you can shore up from there). \n\nBut honestly when I was training classical piano regularly as a kid (good god I feel old saying that but I know I\u2019m not lol), majority of upper level technique mishaps stemmed from struggles with proper wrist & elbow position where students would let their form slide (the more advanced the composition you were playing, the harder it became to remember your technique) and so they\u2019d lack the actual strength and muscle twitch to hit harder moves.   That along with finger strength & dexterity would often result in stumbles or slips, which also vary based on how you strike the key. Most common error you\u2019ll see that slows down technique is wrists dipping below the fingers a la traditional keyboard typing at any point in the playing process, and you\u2019re never gonna swing an arpeggio or move fast enough to trill because your physical relation to the keys is what dictates proficiency. The physical aspect is why pianists are brought in so young (I started at supervised playing at 4 and I started instruction when I could get through the alphabet), because you can shape them into technique machines. \n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for max utility, finger drills, wrist position, and scales as much as possible is going to keep you sharp as hell.",

I\u2019m not quite in LA, my move there is next month end of September, but CoL in San Diego is nearly identical to LA in most ways. Once I put my shit into an excel spreadsheet and did the math on \u201cthis is break even; this is what it looks like if I go out every once and a while; this is what it looks like if I\u2019m off my rocker with my credit card\u201d I could put rather definitive numbers on things and it gave me peace of mind.\n\nAs for more of the how: I think gaming the roommate system is your best bet. I\u2019m moving into a two bedroom place with my roommate/collaborator as well as my long time girlfriend. If you can find a way to split a bedroom, that\u2019s gonna help. 2 bed room houses for rent aren\u2019t that bad if you\u2019re willing to sit down with a drink or two on Zillow for a few nights and really figure out your living area. I\u2019ve found places for the $2300 in East LA and Pasadena. Splitting that and other key living expenses (we plan to have a few nights where we eat together and we\u2019ll sorta rotate meal ideas, that way everyone\u2019s not shelling out super ridiculous individual grocery charges) among 3 people each month is fairly easy so long as we hustle well.",

    "content": "> There was a noticeable number of US clients (artists + their entourages, certain producers, and especially writers - usually in pop or hip hop) who treated assistants like \u201cthe help\u201d / waiting staff / taxi drivers / some menial worker they felt was beneath them. The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nI want to add to what Ruair\u00ed and Matt B said with another perspective. I've had the privilege of working in some very professional settings, where everyone needs to fade into the background to do their jobs properly, and that's absolutely the case at higher levels. And it makes things work. And everyone's cool about it.\n\nBut much of my work has been as producer, assistant producer or project manager/fixer for people working at decidedly lower levels. \n\nAnd idk how it is in other countries, but we have a glut of people here in the US who have a certificate from a for-profit recording school that says they know what they're doing, who think they're *the shit* for being in the room with some viral star off YouTube/Instagram/TikTok. But don't know how to use a damn patch bay. \n\nAnd when you're on the come up, especially as a writer or producer, you interact with a lot of these people, and you get REALLY sick of them REALLY fast. So that might be the source of some of the condescension you see. It's hard not to get jaded when you have to wade through so much incompetence. I feel like a bitter old man just typing this paragraph tbh but I hope I'm not the only one with this experience.",

When I landed in LA for the first session, my mindset was \u201cI can\u2019t wait to show off all the knowledge and experience I had.\u201d I very quickly ran up against the \u201cnobody-gives-an-absolute-fuck-what-I-have-to-say-about-anything\u201d wall. It was very clear that I was there to sit in the back of the room until I was asked to do something\u2026 order food, help with a mic setup, shuffle cars in the parking lot, etc. Not to mention working for someone like Eric who is extremely self sufficient\u2026 he was terrible at asking me to do things. It was always just quicker for him to do it\u2026 even if it meant getting up from the seat and walking all the way across the studio to adjust something. I made the absolute mistake in my second or third week of suggesting something to the drummer in the band after a performance. Eric overheard and pulled me aside. Basically said something along the lines of \u201cyo, you really can\u2019t do that. If you have an idea, run it through me. Absolutely inappropriate, however well intentioned it was. This was really deflating to me. I went from running the show at my own place to spending 14 hrs a day waiting for something to do.",

In hindsight, it was incredibly formative for me that ear training practice and actual theoretical/sheet music knowledge always came alongside the practical element of sitting at keys and performing the pieces I was assigned that week.\n\nI like the idea of breaking down modern pop structure, I like the idea of covering signal flow a lot. I think you can teach and test signal flow in theory while allowing someone to practice their recording technique by mimicking the song structure of their favorite pop song.

Currently it lacks certain contextual awareness about how a part fits into a larger design/ecosystem, and so it's guidance on how to code or design something may be limited to low level coding at the moment.\n\nI've got some friends experimenting with using it to generate content for their Dungeons and Dragons game and while it's been good about generating serviceable scenarios and providing responses to player choices, another limitation that they've encountered is that it doesn't remember things like player state (what was their health when we started, what is their location, etc). That is to say it lacks certain kinds of long-term memory that allow it to maintain continuity.",

    "content": "So sound is captured as electrical signals by disturbing a magnetic field (or in the case of condenser mics, changing the voltage potential across a specially tuned capacitor), which generates an AC voltage corresponding to the compressions and rarefactions in the air. This is a whole topic on its own but tl;dr for dynamics you're moving a magnet back and forth inside a coil of wire, with ribbons you're moving the wire back and forth inside a magnetic field, guitar and bass pickup you're disturbing a magnetic field with vibrating ferromagnetic strings... anyway. \n\nLinear voltage amplifiers (ie class A, and AB for us audio guys) - which we use for mic preamps, line amps, differential amps, power amps, pretty much anything you can think of - work by using an AC voltage to vary DC current flow. In its most basic form, it works like this: That AC signal from the mic or guitar pickup hits either the grid of a vacuum tube or the gate of a FET, and changes the amount of current that flows from one end to the other (usually cathode to plate in a tube, and usually source to drain in FETs). Stick a resistor between the DC power supply rail and the amplifying element and you get a voltage variance because of ohm's law - current goes down, voltage goes up, and vice versa. So, you end up with a bigger version of the input signal, with its polarity inverted. \n\nDistortion is a *way* more complex topic and not one I'm equipped to explain, as I don't understand it very well myself.",

Not the big chef but one of the chefs. During covid he said \u201ceh I have this crazy passion for cooking but never cook for myself. Why don\u2019t I go sell cars?\u201d And he fucking did it and ended up being the only dude I knew who could make $20k a month selling Toyotas without ever having stimulant dependency in his life.

Maybe marginally, if you are already at the extremes of being very very good. This isn't to say it doesn't matter, ala gear, it's just that it's way better to become an AMAZING player than worry about whatever your current instrument is.\n\n2. Sports -- as close as to a meritocracy as anything, literally everyone has to play on the same field with (generally) the same gear, or close to it (especially at higher levels). A lot of the time if I'm feeling like I'm a \"piece of gear away\", I think...would upgrading my cleats make me better? Almost certainly not in any way that would matter. Go practice, that may help, and if you are Lionel Messi or Patrick Mahomes then maybe the gear could give you a tiny advantage you could use\n\nNot so simple, great gear does do a thing, but recentering on yourself is worth a lot I think too",

I also just spent a couple hundred pounds on three new release n-hypen cds for my daughter as a gift the other day (which she told me about )  . Beautifully boxed , artwork pamphlets , high quality print gatefold posters , unlock web codes , stickers , loads of stuff . She cherishes them bless her It\u2019s a touch I still have an older imac with the cd/dvd drive because she is definitely about the cds\u2026\u2026..and it\u2019s mad to think there\u2019s no way to play anything physical on contemporary computers . The loss of the physical format is a huge loss for music imo .fwiw im not a vinyl lover (even though I\u2019ve tons of it and releases of my own on it ) but I do love \ud83d\udcbf I bought up tons of second hand cds  a few years back at 99p a time for sampling purposes (the highest quality format available at that point  compared to vinyl and streams ) . Now my cd collection let\u2019s me listen to all the great pre - 2000s music without needing to suffer the horrific streaming remasters )",

I've got a motto that I say to myself as a matter of process: \"Always invert.\"\n\nWhatever the subject facing me: a problem, a reply in a conversation, an object, a principle I'm adopting, a rule, or an idea, always start by inverting it's properties and seeing what you get. Turn it upside-down and see what that extreme reveals to you, then make a choice.\n\nOften, with an inversion of perspective you get something hilarious, and that can be valuable in it's own right, but just as often you get newfound empathy, or something unexpected, or catch yourself from stumbling into a foolish move. Although, quite often the inversion itself *is* the foolish move because it flies in the face of common sense. \ud83d\ude04",

I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong in any of those boxes. I\u2019ve sat with this feeling of discontent for a long time and realized that the boxes are mirages of idealization, and that NO ONE truly fits into ANY boxes. Part of themselves might be scattered in different boxes- but not all of themselves\n\n\u2018since I\u2019m in this box, I should be this way\u2019\n\nbut this really hindered me from finding my true self.

Silly name, but a stimulating read.\n\nIn the article David describes his epiphany about how popular flavor profiles in recipes re-occur across cultural boundaries. How a Chinese spicy pork sausage and rice cake has the same fundamental flavor profile as an Italian ceci e pepe and they share underlying structures that are expressed differently in their respective cultural incarnations. In math this would be called an isomorphism.\n\nWell this immediately rang to true to me because I'd observed the same thing in music. I thought about this article for a year. Finally I saw that they were giving a talk in a hotel showroom with 500 people in attendance and made it a point to attend.\n\nWhen the open mic was passed around I asked my prepared question, expressing my admiration for their insight and how it was applicable to other domains beyond food. I asked them if they'd had any additional insights on this phenomena since publishing the article.\n\nThey both looked to each other, didn't say a word, and then proceeded to ask for the next question \ud83d\ude15.\n\nTo this day I have no idea what happened.",

At the end our lecturer had us play a game where we had to blind tests deciding whether the string arrangement we're about to hear is real vs. programmed. \nSafe to say, even in a room full of producers, no one got it right enough times to convingly say that you can undoubtedly tell the two apart every time\nI think part of the issue here is that most producer don't bother learning the in and outs of sample libraries with every little nuance which might allow them to get incredibly close to a human performances. This is different when you listen to programmed strings made by someone who does mockups for a living",

The problem I was trying to solve was making my working drive available to me for when I\u2019m away from my studio so I can continue to be responsive to clients at all times. \n\nTailscale allows you to create a secure, private VPN without having to have a networking PHD and compromising your network. Basically install the client on a device, 2-factor auth into the client and any other client you have installed on any device signed in with those same credentials are available to you as if you\u2019re on the same local network, even if you\u2019re on another network anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s an actual game changer.\n\nFor a variety of reasons including keeping my mastering rig lean and clean and because the rig is not always on because I don\u2019t want to run my HVAC 24/7, I sync a clone of my working drive from my mastering rig to a drive attached to an always-on Mac in my home network that has the Tailscale client authenticated. I\u2019ve got screen share enabled on that Mac and now from any other device, I can sign into it and grab whatever I need from that clone drive. You can install the client on virtually any device including NAS\u2019s and mobile phones so it opens up whole new avenues in how to think about availability of your data, traveling, 3rd party cloud vs. rolling your own, etc. Tons of possibilities. Really big fan. Love the future.\n\nhttps://tailscale.com/",

I don't even necessarily listen to everyone's music, I'm often more intwrested in their personal approaches - especially since lost are folk who we'd consider \"established\"  and what I found to be true for most of them is they split into 2 main camps with most of us dancing between them. \n\na) have 0 clue wtf they're going for a lot of the time. kind of going with the flow of whatever is happening /they're feeling in the moment. very similarly to people starting out or me. the approach can vary wildly and a whole concept can be born of something seemingly unimportant at any given moment. \n\nb) there's an outline that comes to mind early and might give some direction. whether that's thematically or sonically. how tightly they stick to this can vary a lot depending on the artist. \n\nI think there are many factors that come into play - how good and ready the team they have is might be one of the most important imo. that's both for the creative side and admin side. \n\nas far answering  your questions as a producer, it depends. \nsome artist I work with will literally dream up the whole production and I'm kind of facilitating and bringing it into the real world. others will come with loose ideas and others will show up with absolutely nothing and go off the feeling in the moment. some are more involved than others in the production\n\nyour relationship with them is probably the biggest factor in knowing how far you can push their creatively bounderies. \nsame artist that dreams up their production usually gives me free range to try whatever I want when the session is over and I've overhauled whole songs.  recently a post-punk ish artist picked up a video game ost /jazz fusion prod I was sketching",

I got a thrill in \u2018seeing the Matrix\u2019 and coming up with my own ways to do things, but ONLY if it had results tied to it. \n\nI have a 6th place finish I got over 10 years ago that I\u2019ll never forget, because I was so obsessed with getting top 5 (preferably #1 but I\u2019d always lie to myself that the next threshold would be enough, but it never was) I was destroying my mind and body and my health was affected. I had to stop focusing on competing and find the deeper layers behind what I was really running from by attaching my self worth to competing like a parasite scared of losing its host.\n\nMusic was actually such a perfect remedy because I can always improve my ability to translate my ideas into reality, but there is no optimal result. No truly perfect song or finish line. Hunting world records was a life of quick-sand, always trying to keep up with the past while showing you can still do it in the present. \n\nThose days of competing taught me that entering the ring, doing my best, and letting go of any care of result is where true joy lies. Any connection to an activity and my self worth, or my complicated authentic identity, has nothing to do with the outcome of how my time was spent, but instead the win of having the ratio of the time I spend in life doing what fulfills me.\n\n-\n\nI made music at that time too, but ever since these breakthroughs my music has become far more authentic, which makes me feel like it\u2019s better. It jumped the quality of my work way more than any technique, because now I sit down to express exactly who I am in that moment, and everything else is a subconscious implementation of everything I\u2019ve learned thus far.",

No one wants to watch someone get drum sounds for hours or any sounds for hours yet we expect the results to sound as if we did.  We have to stay out of the way but always be prepared to catch someone falling.  This job is hard, there are many details that go into making  a session go well.  Id suggest thinking about the things you feel need to go further. Are there ways you can be ahead of the curve ?  Are there ways that you can surprise the room and you can say \u201cI  actually just took care of that, we can move on to the next thing\u201d? We have to be steps ahead of everyone else in the room. Some things do in fact take time and you can decide if doing certain things are disruptive to the flow and you might need to bust it while everyone is getting a coffee or telling the room  \u201c hey gang I need 15 mins to take care of \u2026..\u201d",

So if you like easy grid based edits of overdubs etc it gets a little more complicated than usual . I wasted a bit of time trying to work out the problem then slaving the mpc to daw MTC which then just removes the mpc swing which is counterproductive . So yeah , if at any point it\u2019s gonna be tracked into the daw familiarise and strategise for that asap in the process .",

For context, a band I\u2019m currently working with worked with someone who, locally, is quite popular which is why they hired them but they did not have a good experience/didn\u2019t like the end result (maybe similar to your experience). they complained that engineer they hired had 0 input good or bad and was not super flexible when it came to sounds (drummer likes open toms as opposed to dead, the engineer basically shrugged and said that it was going to cause problems or something to that effect) So I made it a point to communicate my thoughts on takes as much as possible and make suggestions and guide them when needed. It\u2019s been my first full band project in a while, I was doing mostly solo artist production (where I had a lot of creative input and played a lot of instruments and was dealing with one persons vision instead of 4).",

    "content": "I had another job up until the pandemic actually, was working 20+ hours a week, and doing college while working on music, then the pandemic hit and the place I worked at shut down, the business is fully closed now but that's another story. Right now with the government restrictions in Ireland, sooo many businesses are closing and it's near impossible to get a job. \nSo my college then went remote, meaning I had alot more free time on my hands, and no steady income.. This kinda forced me to go all in on production. College finished last May for summer, and I worked hard as fuck on being a better mixer and producer (with the virtual help of Matt and Jon) and also tried to figure ways of making money from it.. Apart from working with local artists (there aint too many here in Dublin) most of the work I got and still get was through soundbetter.com, after a while of grinding I got to a stage where I was and still am, only making a little bit less than the job I was in before, so I can at least survive lol.\n\nBasically long story short, I'm actually kinda full time music right now while finishing off my college degree. Then I've to make a decision of whether I remain fulltime music here, go part time and get a job from my degree, or move to the US or London to pursue music there. It'll prob be one of the latter 2 options cos the scene here is very much in it's early days and not sure if a sustainable career could be had.\nAlso as I said here before I'm very fortunate to live in a country where you can get free education, so debt isn't a worry for me. \n\nThat's my long ass story anyways, since you asked \ud83e\udd23",

There's a lot of people out there with similar unconventional principles to him (like putting load thru knees over toes and back flexion etc) but are definitely much more educated on the topics they're speaking on, and won't block you when you confront them..\n\nId personally reccomend the likes of Jeffery Wolfe (@theflexibull), moses Bernard (@mosesbernard), Dan van zandt (@flexibility.research), Nicholas Simpson (@nicholassimpson_)\n\nI've reached out to them before and they're always very helpful, nice people, I know they often do live videos themselves, maybe it could be worth asking one of them to do a podcast with you..\nI definitely don't consider myself an expert on this stuff, but I feel I have a very good base knowledge on health and fitness, I've been heavily involved in track and feild most my life, competed internationally too, so keeping strong, flexible and pain free is definitely something I've experience in lol",

    "content": "Anyway: uncompressed PCM audio (.wav and .aiff) is made up of digital words generally 16 or 24 bits long recorded however many times a second for a given sample rate, for fixed point (integer) values. Each bit represents ~6dB of dynamic range. Every time you go up in level 6dB from that particular sample point, another bit flips from 0 (off) to 1 (on). The least significant bit defines your noise floor, so 16 bit audio has 96dB of dynamic range at maximum from noise floor to full scale (every bit turned on). Seems simple enough, right? And it isn't super complicated. But it has one problem: you run out of dynamic range real quick if you're changing levels with (virtual) faders at 24 bits. There are two ways around that:\n1, make the mixer engine run on a much higher integer word length (like old Pro Tools HD systems, which use 48 bit integer), and the mixer automatically converts the audio (if anything is done to it, including fader moves) to 48 bit. Think of this as adding more digits to the fractions side of a decimal point. \n2, make the mixer engine run on a floating point system (almost every other DAW, including more modern versions of Pro Tools) - that is, you move *where the decimal point is* . 32 bit float effectively works as 24 bits that can be moved around more or less with impunity, up or down.",

Thankfully BJJ is good for all ages, you can start at any age and still improve a ton for the entire life without a need for above-average physical strength.

Where everyone trains with everyone regardless of skill level (when covid is not a thing) and where people aren\u2019t training to feed their egos. Always talking about what happened, what could have been better going back and forth is a constructive training attitude. No shit/trash talking (unless it\u2019s a joke between close friends/training buddies), and teachers who focus on the fundamental principles of how guards work and leverages work.  Definitely recommend physical hobbies though. We\u2019re always on a chair staring at the screen for hours. Anything that involves moving all four limbs is the way to go.",

I see so much talent on there, genuine talent and artists who have worked hard on their craft getting 10 views due to the algo... once the algo has tried your vid on a few people and it didn't stick the vid is dead... so it's totally hit and miss based on your first small sample of viewers.\n\nI see this having a huge impact in many ways. On the plus - you are getting exposure to incredible new ideas, skills, trends, methods for being creative... on the negative it's demotivating to the nth degree, and cheapening the creative process, in my opinion.\n\nMatt and Jon recently talked about track lengths getting shorter and shorter, now 2 minutes is the normal. Partly due to the attention span of people... well what is this going to do... 1 minute pop tracks incoming? Just gimme the hook in 30 seconds and let's move on please. :p. How can we get young people to lay on the floor and listen to 10 minute vinyl tracks again? In my opinion humanity NEEDS this :)) \n\nI also swear I've heard the influence of trending memes from tiktok coming through in music in the charts, but cannot really back this up.\n\nWhat's everyone else's thoughts? I have a friend in LA who says everyone has gone crazy there for tiktok fame? \ud83d\ude1b",

Most of my feed is just quirky jokes so have yet to see the music side of things. Interested to explore it.",

As long as the core material is compelling it's all fine to me. My one reservation might be if you need to have full cultural context to appreciate the \"meme-ness\" of the song. If the record doesn't hold up on it's own outside of that cultural context then it's probably weak songwriting. It's window of relevance is limited.",

I have made a few myself that I like and found I expressed the feeling and emotion in that time and it didn't need more... but.... what if you are confined to 1 minute for every track all the time... your form of expression is going to change no? Can everything be truly expressed in 1 minute snaps. What about songs that keep you in the vibe and space by having space and time to unfold.... my concern is everything is getting shorter and shorter with tiktok being a big influence. instant gratification, move on, \"i need to find the next hit for my brain\", swipe swipe. this speed, this haste... how is there any chance for music to settle, sit and unfold in the listeners mind? --- and even if you manage that, it's gone almost instantly as they continue swiping for the next \"hit\".",

If they\u2019re not reaching out, could be anything from personal problems to who knows what, give them the benefit of the doubt. if you\u2019re waiting and hungry for it I would wait at leastttt 4-5 days.

First things first can you change it out to a solid core door and add weather stripping and some beefed up stops all the way around? You can get special door seal kits with a droppable bottom seal that seals tight to the floor when the door shuts, although these are like 200 bucks a pop and you can get similar if not better results making something yourself. You want to start by figuring out a rough mass per square foot for your wall assembly (include drywall, stud work, insulation etc) and then bring your door up to the same mass per square foot. Solid core door, good seals all the way around and then you can even add more mass to the door with drywall or plywood. Once your door is at least the same mass per square foot as your wall assembly you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere to gain more isolation",

So many of my opportunities came last minute and having the ability to pivot and make things happen for people was extremely important. For example, I was living in the Bay Area working out of a studio when I reached out to Eric about assisting. He asked if I could come down to LA that weekend to interview/hang-out -- so I got on a plane. At the end of the weekend he hired me and basically said, \"record starts in two weeks -- can you get down here?\". I had to move out of my studio, pack up my life, find a place to live, and get down to make it happen. Obviously that was a great opportunity and most folks in my position would trip over themselves to make it happen -- but I always wondered had I had a day-job with real obligations and financial leverage over my life, would I have been able to make the timeline work... probably not!",

Instead their interest lies in their allegorical representation of people and places. Their unique value lies in the curation of ideas and the story, concept, or idea that they convey. They're telling a pretty sophisticated story under the surface.\n\nLook at these paintings. There's no individual element of either of these that I couldn't render right now with Dall-E and photoshop my own remake together. But right now AI is nowhere close to creating such a cohesive visual composition with it's unspoken message. For now great art still requires a human operator with intention.",

I digested as much as I could about who these people were, what they looked like, what they wore, what guitar they played, etc. etc..

It gives you a year of living in the house to sort out whether any of the major appliances and plumbing are breaking or broken and the peace of mind that those major expenses would be covered. I think it was around a $500-600 value, but I used it enough that first year that it was absolutely worth it.",

    "content": "Which brings me to one of the biggest problems here. Healthcare. Even with good insurance, you will still be paying fairly substantial amounts of money for mediocre service. Your insurance network determines which doctors and hospitals you can go to. God forbid you get sick in the wrong state and need to go to the hospital - even if you have insurance, you might end up paying out of pocket if you're not covered at your point of care. Just don't get sick, and DEFINITELY don't have any chronic illnesses.This dysfunction applies to social services in general. Where things can be privatised, they have been, and where they haven't, they don't really work.\n\nThen there are socio-cultural factors. Politics is a spectator sport, and Americans LOVE sports. Red team and blue team *hate* each other with a passion that is unmatched by political parties pretty much anywhere there isn't an active civil war on. Related but slightly different, race-based animosity is becoming more and more of a problem again the last few years after half a century of social progress. You will be able to avoid getting dragged into this by being an expat/resident alien/what have you, but you need to be aware that it's there. Another related issue to this is education. The vast majority of people in the US did not receive anything close to an adequate education to function in the modern globalised world, even if they went to college. This leads to a lot of parochialism and narrow-mindedness that spreads bad ideas fast.",

Even if your particular way of expressing it doesn't hit home for some people, the beauty of this server is that there are several of you speaking to similar values. \n\nAs C\u00edan just noted, his generation was one of the last waves to get that education. I got a little bit of it early on, but by the time I was working in this full time, it was attitude over aptitude everywhere I looked except for a few people who were lucky to get into the remnants of the previous system.\n\nI guess this is partially me trying to express gratitude and appreciation, and also begging y'all not to hedge what you're saying, for the sake of the people coming up now, coming up through the mess.",

Ran on a ton of mixing sessions and helped his guy out tho in that time...  the main assisting gig was a band called thousand foot krutch. I think maybe also a day or two on five finger death punch? I dont have it written down tho so not sure. Just digging back into my iCal now... the last long session i ran on before that was nickleback dark horse.. was like a month+ i think? I remember one day getting a fax from Mutt and it was just the song lyrics and little up and down arrows to show what vocal rides he wanted on like a bunch of words/parts of words and phrases lol.

My question is what is an asset id and where do you find it?\n\nMy friend released one EP through Tonetree and those tracks do have an asset id but his back catalogue was through Tunecore. MB suggested he switch his entire back catalogue over to Tonetree just to get asset id's for those tracks which frankly seems pretty dumb to me. Anyone familiar with this?",

The conversation threads are very meandering and I would have to rephrase instructions up to a half dozen times sometimes before it understood what I was trying to do. It would provide a suggestion, I'd do it and get an error, share the error, and it would correct itself. Several of those loops in a row. A buddy of mine who is a computer programmer was telling me about a peer of his who created a program that prompts chat gpt to write code then automatically feeds any errors back into chat gpt and it keeps looping and looping and looping until the code works. Pretty cool stuff",

Some of the subjects were audio professionals and some were lay people.\nWhen the subjects listened back to these recordings, there was significant variance in their ability to localize the sound sources. If I remember correctly, they were generally better at listening through their own pinnae than others were, and audio professionals were a bit better at sound localization in general, particularly in the traditional stereo field. However, the really interesting finding was that there were some pinnae that were universally better or worse. People actually had improved localization through someone else\u2019s pinnae than their own, implying that although we are adapted to our own pinnae, there are material differences that make some better than others for localization of sound.\nThis is all from memory of reading something a few months ago, so I apologize if there are details that aren\u2019t 100% accurate, but I assure you that the surprising bit is correct!\n\nHRTF-based binaural mixes are not exactly the same thing as dummy head recordings, but I wonder if, in the creation of the aforementioned \u201cballer individual HRTF\u2019s\u201d there might be a place for some optimization beyond the exact copying of an individual\u2019s unique acoustic properties.",

The first LWMR i ever tuned into i was like, dyauuuummm this guy is really getting riled up about this stuff (in a good way)..lol, its great ...and matt is a real gent and a great host and shepher of the convos......i hope jon keeps doing it and enjoying it ....and again....i really enjoyed your quote ruairi about self being the cause of suffering. this is another core buddhist teaching. ego is the source of all suffering. destroy self destroy suffering. dukkha is self.  From an outside perspective it was also weridly v cool to hear yall had been telling jon how great the 6lack album sounds....i agree...serban couldnt do that . no shade...but he couldnt. im glad jons mixing records in hip hop and r and b . he's keeping the standards up....obviously , you ruairi and spider discussiing this place (the discord) ....your read on it ....as someone giving so much ...and mine as someone receivng so much....is that youre doing a great job man ...its much appreciated.",

    "content": "It\u2019s funny you mention California.......so, my sis lives outside a old market town called tavira right in the countryside by the sea....just next to the Spanish border down the v bottom...its so quiet and just all orange and olive fields for miles. So i go out there to decompress from london regularly.....i mention Cali myself because when my sis moved there a few years back I\u2019d go out on long runs....and its just fields and semi arid hills as far as the eye can see and ocean on the other side. It reminded me so much of SOCAL , the only difference is that it is so underdeveloped still and must be what Cali was like 100 years ago. A land of orange farms and v little water. I told my sis this a couple years ago and sure enough local news reports Hollywood films being made over there in the next few years (a bit like Sergio leane with the spaghetti westerns in Spain ) . Would love a dm about those local spots as well man thanks. Did ya ever make it to Bilbao? It\u2019s a great town and the museum of modern art by gaudi is a sight",

    "content": "I can't stop thinking about this idea of \"Why don't you play something that people actually like?\"\n\nI personally wrestle a lot with the idea of making music *for* other people. It's simply not very high on my list of priorities. I'd say I'm self-centered in how I approach making music. I'm out to make stuff that *I* want to hear. Things that aren't being represented elsewhere. Flavors I've never heard. I'm not aiming for a broad appeal, but I'm also not shying away from it. I'm just not much of a people pleaser in that regard. I'm in it for the discovery and the exploration and the pleasure of making something that excites me.\n\nI think often about that Steve Jobs sentiment of \"People don't know what they want until they see it.\" I think about that a lot. I trust that if I follow what feels good to *me* then I'll get something valuable out of it, and maybe it'll connect with others. If not, that's alright too. I'll know that I've made something that feels great.\n\nI sometimes worry about this because I've always felt that it puts me at odds with a lot of people out here trying to make excellent records. Sometimes our goals will align, but I just don't feel motivated by the need to appeal to a lot of people and that can also make us diverge.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a different kind of taste that I'm trying to cultivate. It's one that runs parallel to the kind of taste that is good at appealing to a large number of people. I feel as if I'm aiming at an entirely different goalpost from people playing the other game. I want to tickle people in a way that they didn't know they were capable of. That's what's thrilling to me.",

I also don\u2019t feel like someone who only likes to listen to the top of the charts has better taste, although you could say it\u2019s empirically true that they do.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019ve deliberately chosen to create something that\u2019s not for everyone brings me back to the Conversations episode about the Service-Artisan Continuum. There\u2019s no need to plant your flag on the service end of the spectrum if it doesn\u2019t bring you joy and there\u2019s food on your table. And there\u2019s nothing that says you can\u2019t serve clients by day and let creativity run wild by night.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got something profound to say, it would be a damn shame to water it down for the public\u2019s taste. I don\u2019t think Radiohead would have had the impact that they did if they\u2019d written another \u201cCreep\u201d.",

Maybe a big lift to integrate, but I'm doing so much stuff over text/DM/whatsapp that I really would love everything in a single window (including email) that I could label and pin and track over the course of projects\n\nImagine all current projects pinned to the top, categorized, etc. and can reply to everything from one window and arrange the most important stuff at the top. And you avoid the issue of having to have anyone use some other form of communication than they already are (signing up for something, etc)\n\nNot as great as I'm making it seem probably. But on my end it would be a big improvement. Stupidly you need another user to invite you at the moment\n\nDiscord idea for Nomograph very interesting as well!\n\nUPDATE: Apparently you can get a free trial now if you sign up to pay after its over (can cancel during the 30 days).

Not said in this context with a political motivation, but, in capitalism we just have these things popping up all the time with no regard to whether we *want* them or whether they will make our lives *actually better*. And no, I don\u2019t think an app that streamlines you getting your dog groomed or whatever is actually a substantive improvement in human life. So much stuff we have now actually makes us *less* happy and fulfilled, and so I always want to push back on the next new thing having had the hindsight of how these products have played out over the last two decades.

The incremental projects drive has saved me countless times when I need to revert some changes or accidentally write-over a cue when I forget to save-as. \n\nWhen projects are done, they get backed up to two duplicate hard drives plus an NAS which has copies of all those hard drives but in one place. \n\nI haven't done the Backblaze thing yet, so I'm still at risk in the event of fire/flood/zombie attack.",

The way I see it is sync placement is fulfilling more of the utility aspect of art, while making records for people to listen to is a more artistic endeavor in service of the people that listen to the records. But the reality is that everyone\u2019s streaming and that doesn\u2019t pay. Even with the biggest success- it won\u2019t make money correspondent to the level of success. \n\nBudget for record production is now more of a PR for their shows or tours. (As far as what I can tell)\n\nSo why in a sane mind would anyone spend money on making it other than for their own satisfaction? It\u2019d be insane to see making records as business investment unless you\u2019re really aiming for sync in mind. But then, what most of us fell in love with are the amazing records that we grew up listening to. Maybe a song from a movie occasionally, but probably not quite a track from sports spot nor a jingle. \n\nAt this point, is there really a way to monetize real money from records other than sync? If there can be, what would that be?",

Sometimes, our brain; designed to survive does not serve us in actual survival. For example, the reward system will likely value time spent watching a movie over working hard to make the dough. \n\nThe less \u201cworking\u201d matters for survival, the more likely we will start seeking meanings beyond survival. Humans are likely going to go through existential crisis and figure out what it really means to \u201clive\u201d",

There isn\u2019t much reason for them to question ROI. I don\u2019t say this to invalidate your point, I think we\u2019re just in a different playing field with different rules. \n\nIf I lowered my price to $300 a song, I\u2019d have no problem getting work.

And of course maybe that\u2019s what I need to do to get to the point I want to be, but I\u2019d rather do it for no money and have more freedom in controlling my portfolio and having more potential long term returns. \n\nAll of your points are valid points though",

(Lol.)\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to live in nyc my entire adult life and never have\u2014it\u2019s never made sense to do it career-wise and probably never really will. But every time I\u2019m there I feel totally at home and happy and excited in a way I don\u2019t anywhere else. I spent a summer there several years ago and always linger as long as I can whenever I can, have close friends there (not in music), end up there usually a couple times a year and relish it every time. I feel like I know it as well as is possible for never having been a resident.\n\nI know the music biz there is pretty much defunct (at least compared to LA), and I really *really* don\u2019t want to repeat the emotional and financial ruin that I experienced moving to LA and restarting everything 6 yrs ago\u2026 but from a non-career perspective it\u2019s where I want to be.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m in it to fucking win it in LA for my career\u2014though with an eye for sure on getting to a point where I can relatively comfortably make that move.\n\nAny wisdom/experience on making a mid-career move like this from folks here? I\u2019m 35 yrs old, some decent credits but not major traction yet, in a basically married but not actually married relationship with a school principal who is into the idea of a move there as well (though our finances are totally separate and I for sure need to earn!), no kids or desire/plan to have kids.\n\nAny benchmarks/goals that might be reasonable to aim for before seriously starting to make moves on this? I\u2019d do it tomorrow if I could, but would also stay in LA for 5+ more years no prob to set things up properly. Even open to things like a podcast (/radio?/other audio prod) gig to help smooth the transition if that\u2019s reasonable to find and lucrative enough\u2014but what I\u2019m really looking for is how to think of this as a full time freelance record maker. Or if someone on here secretly is hiring for staff gigs at Electric Lady, plz lmk \ud83d\ude09",

Have $250k we\u2019re about to write off (and we\u2019re not big enough for that not to hurt bad). Commit to something you end up not being able to deliver on? Having to tell clients \u201csorry\u201d a lot? All sound like PM issues. And no, you can\u2019t \u201csolve\u201d them, but with clear process and communication you can nudge a project towards more repeatability. I try to be up front and just very clearly and kindly lay out what I have seen before and consider \u201cnormal\u201d (I mean, for me, I\u2019m Portland of course). I find people like it when I bring the PM structure to the project\u2026 all depends on framing but I have good luck. And even some basic checklists I follow in initial meetings.",

Wants to throw away their entire fan base in rock music to do pop (which is pretty damn bold considering they have 2m followers on tiktok lol) and they told me they really want do the blinding lights thing. Which IMO is not a great idea as I think new artists making top 40 sounding tracks is kinda hard to pull off. And then you also have the fact that the whole 80s thing is feeling dated already. I think they need to go more indie since their voice suits the genre and their image won\u2019t have to be tweaked too much and there should be a solid crossover of current fans, but I ain\u2019t the artist here. So I just talked to them about it and told them I\u2019m gonna take a few extra days and make sure this feels right for the above reasons and if they hate it that\u2019s fine we\u2019ll try again until it\u2019s right. So I guess I\u2019ll post his response today when he writes back.

Things that give certain people a head start on different crafts can probably be analyzed into different components. While \u201ceither you have it or you don\u2019t\u201d can lead to defeatist thinking, I believe seeing them as a make up of different components can really bring out individuals\u2019 best self. \n\nwe all have our fortes, but not everyone is able to break them down and integrate the different strengths to create synergy. And the \u201ctalented\u201d individuals are the ones who has integrated the different strengths, whether it was through deliberate discoveries or something that was given to them circumstantially. I believe rephrasing \u2018innate talent\u2019 to something like \u2018natural qualities/traits\u2019 can lead to more freedom and more useful perspective than \u201cI could never be like X\u201d - because of course you can\u2019t, you are not X. \n\nWhich brings back to what you were saying about the value of  journey over the prize",

I still keep all files on the old external drive in case I found anything has been damaged or broken during the move to LaCie.\n\nThe plan is to set up LaCie with Dropbox. I wiped my dropbox (that used to be a clone of the old drive) completely from the browser in order to set it up with LaCie.\n\nNow, setting it up with LaCie it says that the file format (Exfat) isn't compatible and I need to change the format of the drive to HFS+ or APFS. I know that while changing the format the drive will be completely wiped. So before doing this I need to transfer all the files again to another location. I have two external drives, a macbook and an iMac. None of them have enough storage to store my 2.5tb folder.\n\nAnyone have any idea of a good option other than to get ANOTHER external drive just to perform the move?\n\nIs my best option to make a back up of the old drive to Dropbox backup, then wipe the drive, move all files from Lacie back to it, reformat Lacie, move all files back to Lacie, wipe the old drive and download the backup from dropboc back to it?",

That they are turned off by middling success after many attempts over time.\n\nWould a truly amazing *undeniable* record have a better shot at commercial success under a new artist name with no previous middling successful tracks or nah?

In 20yrs those catalogs will not have a multiple value, but it will be a diminished return (less than 1x) ....  not a growth (greater than 1x multiple).  \n\nIf Rod Stewarts catalog generated $300 Million during the height of his popularity (including tours)...   The value of his catalog over the decades would be a fraction of that.  To recoup $100 Million would require $10 Million x 10yrs in ROYALTY alone to break even. He (reportedly) earned $7 Million from his music in 2013.  So the ROI couldn't profit until 2037 (without touring income).  His fanbase will be effectively extinct by 2040 and it's going to be hard to break 1980s trends on future generations.

Numbers were bigger a before the last year or two before interests rates went up, because the catalogs were basically being bought by borrowed money.\n\nAs matt said, Irving has a long track record of making really smart business decisions both for himself and his artists, so I was curious if @SoundsLikeJoe had specific information regarding the financials of Rod\u2019s catalog or if he was speculating.",

We talked about a bunch of stuff but one of the themes we explored was the idea that one needs a \u201cportfolio\u201d of slick & great sounding work to get hired\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided that then it becomes the focus, and changes the way things feel and the way decisions about time, who you work with etc get made. Concepts like \u201cI\u2019ll suck it up and work for free but *then* I will have a singular \u201cgood track\u201d for my portfolio\u201d. Of course there are exceptions but it feels to me that there\u2019s something very constricting and materialist about this way of being in the world. There can be a tension between what the artist wants or what the song wants to be and what makes you look \u201cgood\u201d in your portfolio - they want mono and grimy but you want wide/lush/impressive\n\nIn our jam I proposed a kind of thought experiment, an end of the line or extreme of the \u201cneed portfolio\u201d way of thinking\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say you are here, a young writer, producer, mixer. You\u2019ve been doing it 3 or 4 years. You feel that one of the reasons you are not getting hired, getting shots or getting paid well is that there isn\u2019t a body of work for a potential client to judge you by. Ok, here\u2019s comes the magic trick. I\u2019m going to grant you a genie wish portfolio! 5 killer tracks with  great collaborators. Not hot 100 #1 but the kind of work that you really feel would represent you best in the world. Boom. There it is\u2026\n\nSo now what? You get some DMs and sessions start happening. But you\u2019re not ready. You\u2019re not fit for game day. You\u2019re in over your head, and don\u2019t have the fluency, the experience, the reps and the humblings that build a great music business pro. In short you\u2019re not ready for the opportunities the genie wish portfolio granted you",

    "content": "when we think of how language and words get created out of necessity, we can also use that to work our way back and analyze why certain words become popular or lost its use over time. especially with internet, language started driving a good part of pop culture. we don\u2019t want the words to limit our expressions, we want words to enable more articulate expressions and thinking -> both are happening from what I see. \n\nWhy does the new generation feel the need to minimize and maximize everything? Why can\u2019t we spend our effort into exploring everything in between? \n\nDo everything in between come with labels or do they become lengthy sentences and paragraphs? \n\nI think the answer to all of this is complexity of life that us humans brought onto ourselves. That is the cycle of \u201cwhy older generation can\u2019t understand newer generations\u201d\n\nolder generations make the world \u201cbetter\u201d - (technologies and advancement of civilization & cultural understanding ) for the new generation. But what this \u201cbetter\u201d comes with many times though, is complicated soup of mess. This causes overload in young people\u2019s minds trying to make sense of this world. Many or most don\u2019t have the patience to keep on trying to explore the nuances in between. Or can\u2019t afford to take the time / invest the energy to do so. I believe the lack of dimensions in the new generation\u2019s language is a product of this. \n\n@NoahNeedleman said older, less nuanced in opinion & younger, less nuanced in language. I believe both are true for both younger and older people *if they ended up giving up trying to dig deeper to explore and ponder on \u201ceverything in between\u201d*. I don\u2019t think age has anything to do with it. It\u2019s just that the disparities between those who had the patience for nuance vs those who gave up trying become more apparent as people get older.",

They won\u2019t be able to get a disability check, but will have harder time living than others with average or higher intelligence. \n\nIt gave me a new perspective on why I can\u2019t seem to communicate with or understand certain people, and that it needs to be approached with empathy whenever possible. \n\n+ poverty can affect people\u2019s brain development. not only from the lack of education but the stress that goes on in the household due to poverty can affect children\u2019s brain development.

If we can agree that thoughts become things by the use of words ( I have an idea \ud83d\udca1, I communicate this by the use of words ) the idea is received and expanded on in the listeners mind . They add to the idea . We communicate these ideas in dialogue with bankers and engineers and this idea is manifested in the physical world . A thought becomes a thing . Imho this can be described as magic . \ud83e\ude84 so words are indeed powerful , they are in fact magical . No surprise then that \u2026.in school we are taught that the process of creating words from letters is called ???? Spelling .

    "content": "I loved the analysis, I had thoughts about a few points he mentioned. \n\n1. Paradox of climbing up to the highest level\nCould Michael Jordan have become Michael Jordan if it wasn\u2019t for the feeling of someone chasing behind him to become one of the greatest of all time? There is only one Michael Jordan, and can anyone else be that one and only without going through what he has put himself through? \n\n2. Acceptance vs Dissatisfaction\nI think the dilemma here is between satisfaction and acceptance vs beating. I don\u2019t think one or the other is necessarily the answer, but I think a good place to be is finding acceptance in where I am right now while still beating on myself to keep on improving to the highest level I could be. \n\n3. Potential\nThis is a crazy concept to me. Who is anyone to evaluate someone\u2019s ceiling of improvement? Spider defined the meaning of \u2018potential\u2019 perfectly in my opinion. Not his exact works but; one\u2019s capable/willing range of adaptation. Did the professor in Whiplash really expand his students\u2019 potential in this sense? \n\n4. Abusive Internal voice \nI love how he saw the professor as our internal voice. And it made perfect sense to why I was so obsessed with this movie and the character. He was myself to me all along. I went back and forth over and over on whether this relationship was worth it to either of them. I think perhaps limited to this particular two people, because they had common goals/interests and made it happen. \n\n5. Joy?\nI feel that this is the most simple and complex out of all things here. Can anyone NOT experience any frustration while trying to get better at something? If the answer is no, is there a way to better manage the frustration? \n\nPursuit vs Result, our brain works the most consistently when we look towards pursuit. Result feels good but not for long, but what if the result meant more than just the goal being achieved? What if the \u201cresult\u201d portion leads to another pursuit after another?",

The expression of self that I see or the lives they lived; I just can\u2019t be convinced that they believe in what they sing often times. \n\nToo many people want to be cool/hip - which in turn makes it lame. but what if they can be their \u201cuncool\u201d self, and still be loved, therefore being \u201ccool\u201d again?",

If I\u2019m \u201cmaking content\u201d and notice that I\u2019m doing so out of a place that is less than genuine, I will just delete and move on. \n\nFor me, the \u201cmix tips\u201d thing came out of a sincere place of excitement and passion. I would, as a growing mix engineer, stumble upon something that excited me, and I would find myself wanting to turn around to the people in the room to share\u2026well, there\u2019s almost never anyone in the room with me. So, I channeled that passion and excitement in a genuine way to share with the small community of mixers, mastering engineers and producers that I knew on IG. \n\nAt the beginning of my career on to the middle of my career, that became a very fruitful source of business for me - people who followed me on IG, who enjoyed my posts, and began to view me as someone who MIGHT know a thing or two about mixing. \n\nAs my career has developed and my clientele has growing, that has become less important, but it was absolutely pivotal in helping me build a deep bench of great clients, both indie and signed. \n\nBut\u2026I NEVER did it for that reason. It was always (and continues to be) a genuine result of my passion for what I do.",

They may be credible, but since they don\u2019t recognize your potential, they\u2019re not coaches who will help you improve. Their disbelief quickly becomes your insecurity. It shatters your confidence and stifles your growth. That\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. But the research suggests that when they come from an uninformed audience, low expectations can become a self-negating prophecy. You\u2019re motivated to shatter their confidence that you won\u2019t succeed. Samir calls it the underdog effect.\" - Adam Grant, *Hidden Potential*\n\nAlso related are the concepts of the Pygmalion and the Golem effect in social psychology. Where low / high expectations for students / beginners can become self fulfilling prophecies. Begs the question how do you find the balance between being honest / truthful with folks just starting out without significantly undermining their intrinsic motivation and confidence?",

It\u2019s pushed them to self-assess hardddd and actually make some of the most vulnerable, confident and best sounding music so far. Never thought about it but yeah. If you can handle having an enemy you should have one. Someone who passionately and vehemently disagrees with you, fundamentally. Great opportunity for growth.",

    "content": "Without telling the story about two years ago I had my first \u201cbad\u201d client. They were in the middle of building a house (unknown to me) and decided this would be a great time to manage that project but also make a record with me. Because I was under the impression that studios were financially out of reach for this person, I worked at half my usual rate and allowed them to give me a small deposit to start working together. MY MISTAKE.  Every time they came to the studio they were stressed out and unfocused. I did my best to make their home recordings sound great but there was very little good communication and it ended up that when I sent a mix over, I got a 8 paragraph dump about how nothing is working out, the mix was nothing they would ever release, then proceeded to call me a bunch of names - just taking out all their frustration on me. I zipped up all the work I had done so far and sent it over saying I think it\u2019s best if we went our separate ways, you can do what you like with what we\u2019ve done so far - I don\u2019t want any credits at all. Since then it\u2019s motivated me to make sure that I am following my process and OVERcommunicating every step of the way to be sure there\u2019s no confusion about the work I do with clients. I learned that this former client bad mouthed me to a few artists and I lost some work because of it. Eventually work got back to normal and it\u2019s been steady rocking ever since. The memory of how I felt motivated me everyday to be better than the day before, no joke - I know there\u2019s going to be bad days here and there but I\u2019ll be damned if I ever let someone take advantage of me like that again.",

I\u2019m with you . \n\nI think what I\u2019m wondering about is \u2026..with our modern lifestyles I totally get how the consumer is listening mostly by headphones now . And we as music makers are freed up enormously by working in headphones . I think rod waves album got a Grammy and was mixed on headphones iirc, perhaps it was a number 1 . Anyhoo , so I\u2019m not contesting the movement to headphone mixing , I\u2019m wondering for those who intend to or are doing all their work on headphones \u2026..how will you know how it feels in air ? As one day , the artist will perform it live . I come from club and sound system culture , so the ultimate destination is a wall of speaker boxes \u2026..and in the end music has to be re inforced for public performance . How do we know we ve got that balance right if we don\u2019t use speakers ? (Honest question )",

    "content": "the word \u201cemotion\u201d needs a better definition sometimes in the space we are in. \n\nEmotion isn\u2019t necessarily something that you are always aware of \u201cfeeling\u201d. Some reactions are merely state of mind, until it is given a name. Some reactions are visceral because of what the chemicals do to our body. \nsometimes, it\u2019s neither visceral nor label-able. Which makes us assume that it\u2019s not a feeling or emotion. But can we really differentiate emotions and thoughts? What exactly would differentiate them? \n\nOn the other hand, there is music that pushes more, versus music that pulls more. \n\nJust like how audio is bipolar, we can\u2019t have connections just be a one way communication. Tame Impala is a type of music that pulls. You don\u2019t know why, but you just want to know \u201cwhat was that song? I GOTS TO FIND OUT\u201d. \n\nPush is more like\u2026 \u201cI can\u2019t unhear it\u201d a lot of Pop hits are push with some pull factor. \n\nthe ones that make you bummed out that you couldn\u2019t shazam are ones that pull you in. it\u2019s a slight push that gets you listening, and the rest of it is just pulling you in. (my own reaction when I first heard tame impala and couldn\u2019t find out whose song it was)\n\nCulturally, I think the love for (dreamy sound) can be explained with a desire to escape reality. \n\nSo really, the emotional reaction is that \u201cit transports me into a different space\u201d. My theory on \u201cwhy do people like that feeling?\u201d is that many people aren\u2019t happy with the reality of our lives because of economy and what not. And the idea of \u201cescape from reality\u201d became more and more a viable thing for us to want after experiencing digital devices and internet.",

I've already sent over consolidated sessions with the \"best takes\". Anyone run into this before? Would take me at least a day. I feel like the standard has always been consolidate and zip the session folder? Please educate me.",

    "content": "With credits, is there a general consensus or definition on the distinction between  \"producer\" and \"additional production\" or is it always a case by case thing? Had a song I worked on (finished the production and did the mix) come out today. At the beginning of the project I had asked to be listed as a producer and mixer but realized when it came out, that the artist had listed himself as the producer and me as additional production/instrumentation, and mixer. The artist is a really good and longtime friend and I am going to just talk to him and ask that he fixes the credits (and will start making written agreements before all of my projects) but I am curious if there is any broader context that could help how I approach the conversation? \n\nNot super critical to the main question but here are some specifics of my situation: Artist wrote the song, and recorded some basic tracks (drums, vox, guitar). We then worked on it in my studio and I played more instruments (bass, guitars, keys, lap, steel, percussion). We then finished it remotely a few months later. Sent the Ableton production session back and forth a few times times and then I prepped and exported the files myself and mixed it in Protools. And I had to do what I would consider a fair amount of heavy lifting in the mix: song was pretty complicated and recorded at home so I ended up do doing a lot of clean up, some tuning, and a lot of sound shaping and effects. All that to say, this case feels pretty cut and dried but I am curious to know what types of work would appropriately fall under \u201cadditional production\u201d and what is standard in the industry.

    "content": "The main reason I was planning on bringing this up with the artist is because we had initially agreed on roles and credits before I started working on the song (just not in writing because he's a close friend and it didn't seem necessary at the time).  And I agreed to do the project and set my rate (offered a pretty significant friend discount) under the premise that I would be credited in a certain way. I totally understand that some artists want to be the only producer on their projects and if I was ghost producing a song for someone I would have probably charged a lot more. Either way, that doesn't seem like something that an artist gets to decide on their own after the song has already been completed. In my case I think it was just an honest mistake or he forgot or we had a miscommunication and its an easy thing to check in about and resolve. But it just made me wonder going forward if there is a clearer distinction between the two roles.",

    "content": "I was recently inspired after going to the cinema to see *A Complete Unkown*, the movie memoir about Bob Dylan; partially by Bob's story, but also by Timothy Chalomee's performance as Bob. All of the shots of him performing in the movie were fully live - which is an impressive feat by itself - but even more impressive that he apparently wasn't much of a musician before making the movie. I didnt know much about Timothy before this, so I watched his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's YouTube channel. One thing I found really interesting was how available he made himself to learning the role. For example, he didn't turn his phone on for 3 months straight. Got me thinking about how much I can get distracted during the day, and how these distractions can get in the way of me actually giving 100% to the art that I'm working on. I'm sure you all can imagine how the distractions in your own life can effect your work. Might be TikTok videos, might be discord, might be lusting over getting new converters or monitors or guitars, etc, you get the idea. So I guess what I'm saying here is that if I want to compete with the best, maybe I have to understand how to impliment systems in my life that allows me to be more available to the things that I am working on. I want it to be like lifiting a heavy weight at the gym - at the bottom of a heavy squat, you've no choice but to focus on pushing the bar back up with good form, cos that think will break you otherwise. There's a certain thing that happens in your brain when you're forced to only think about one thing for a prolonged, or even short period. It's something akin to meditating. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is if anyone has ever given this subject any thought before, and if anyone has ever done anything to get better at these things? I'm still not sure if all this only makes sense inside my own head.",

Rn I'd feel very uncomfortable listening to Kanye, however, I don't think I'd have too much of a problem turning on the TV and popping in a Polanski movie, even though what he did is incredibly heinous. \n\nMaybe it's bc for me as a European what Kanye did goes so against everything I've been taught and that's been engrained into me since I was a little kid (showing the swastika or doing the nazi salute is a crime here and can get you into prison mind you) - very rightly so -, or maybe what he does feels so terrible bc he has so much influence and it will likely directly or indirectly influence millions of people who already face more than enough hatred even without Kanyes input. \n\nNot to mention the last time he said stuff like this it directly lead to hate crimes. \n\nBut still, an interesting observation.

    "content": "Me personally, Yeezus was the last album that I was super moved by and I've never really had much of a desire to revisit any of his stuff, as brilliant as it is (though I might try after this convo). But on this topic, I find it hard/impossible to completely 100% enjoy a piece of work after the artist has done something disagreeable, taken a public downfall or occasionally if I had a negative personal experience with them. Even though I might intellectually appreciate the beauty of the work, my heart just feels a slight bit of ick -- akin to that feeling of trying to enjoy a meal that you know is super delish but you burned your tongue on a hot cup of coffee the day before. So I\u2019ll just end up choosing to listen to something else instead. This also makes me intensely appreciate my past experiences with the art. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever enjoy it the same way again but I\u2019m so glad I was able to completely enjoy Puff Daddy productions, R. Kelly songs, Woody Allen\u2019s movies, Bill Cosby\u2019s comedy, and Kanye West\u2019s early albums when they were coming out and having their day. I\u2019m resolved that it was a time in my life and in the universe and that time might be over now. Kinda like the ex-girl that you remember fondly but would never ever ever go back to.",

They Never deliver it. Despite you sitting in an empty room. All day. Reading 14 automated messages over two days to be prepared. They said Monday. I had to be back to work Monday. And canceled for moral reasons. And sourced the materials thru a local lumber and rest from Lowes. Then got refunded two numbers that didn't match any I got charged. Started today looking for 284.71. Got back 155.15. Sales rep thought the only difference was the 89.99 they were still charging me for the delivery they never made. But that left me looking for 40 more. I had to spend 10 mins walking him thru the math. And that his subtotal wasnt what i got charged. So they coukd put it correct on a report. To Be pushed up the chain to a more senior person.

Sold my car, got rid of my apartment, and flew out to Melbourne. Band had a moment but I got tossed out just as the song was going number 1. Had no money to get home, no where to stay, and was literally 23 living on our producers couch in a country about as far from home as possible. And I called my pop, basically telling him how bummed/scared/fucked I was. And he goes \u201cyou know, I just got off the phone with **** (a very famous actor friend of ours). If there\u2019s anyone that had it all, you\u2019d think it was him. Big career, wife on the cover of sports illustrated swimsuit edition, fans everywhere. But it turns out his Dad just passed, his wife is cheating on him, and if this new show doesn\u2019t get picked up they might lose the house they just bought. EVERYONE has their share of crap they have to deal with, give or take, no matter how easy it looks from the outside. Life isn\u2019t about what happens to you, it\u2019s about how you deal with what happens to you. Figure out a way to make the most of what\u2019s going on\u201d. For some reason, knowing that EVERYONE\u2019s life sucks to some degree, was immensely helpful in getting me back on my feet.\n\nThe other was a year or two later, when I started tuning vocals for Rob Cavallo. One of his wrecking crew of session musicians had been in a band with a huge hero of mine, who had sadly took his own life mid way through making his second record. I asked the guy if there was anything he could tell me about working with said hero, and he said \u201che was the best musician I\u2019ve ever met. Whatever instrument you played he was better at it than you were within 10 minutes of picking it up. But he seemed to think he was the only guy that ever got a raw deal from the music industry\u201d.",

    "content": "I like the idea of agency as practice. A really talented artist I've been working with recently is young and very new to the industry. They don't know much about being a recording artist, how publishing works, how the business side of things goes down, or what kind of a team they need to build around themselves etc. So I suggested some further reading, shared some of my experience and gave them some tips (as I always try to do with younger artists, to do what you say @spectrummasters and support them). Their response was 'Honestly my manager can do all of this for me, I just want to focus on the music, it's all too complicated and goes over my head'.\n\nSo what can you do \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nThis, I guess, is one example of someone who could really do with some personal agency. If their manager walks, they're a bit fucked. There are thousands of other young artists out there who will be actively educating themselves on the business, joining Discord groups like this for furthering their networks and education, and proactively looking at how the arc of their career can be navigated 'by them', not 'to them'. This kind of proactive attitude would immediately gift the artist I'm working with a leg-up, giving them an advantage over peers, with a higher chance of success. The more they do this, the more control they have over their career. It's a win-win.\n\nSo back to a more definition-based view of the term 'agency', or like I said before 'nous', a lot of folks could do with more of it and I totally see both sides of this conversation. It's good to explore the cultural and societal effects on something like this as nothing exists in a vacuum, but on a general, everyday level, it's SUPER useful and important to try and exercise control over outcomes. Is the opposite of agency apathy?",

They put electret mics in your ears, record IR sweeps of each speaker in your room through them, then put headphones on, record IR sweeps of those, then have some sort of sum/difference algo that translates it all.\n\nWhen you get measured, go for relatively high SPL sweeps. We tried it at a few different levels and at lower levels, the result was pretty unimpressive. You can also go too high and distort, but worth trying a couple times if they\u2019re game, which I\u2019m 100% sure they will be for you",

I\u2019ve had many wins, but going a long period without financial wins has made me question the judgement I have when navigating everything.\n\n\u201cWinning\u201d to me is a culmination of things that can be summed up as living authentically while positively contributing to the world and lives of others. It helps fight of the tendrils of negativity I feel coming from so many angles of the outside world, especially in the last decade.\n\nI don\u2019t exactly know what I\u2019m asking. Or want. I\u2019m looking to process these feelings and synthesize them into a new level of awareness as I move forward with what I\u2019ve learned being integrated into my subconscious.\n\nSometimes being around others, or hearing their experiences and takes, helps me get angles of things in a way that I can piece together for a rough draft of what will become the lesson that I carry with me moving forward, regarding this topic at this time.",

    "content": "For sure , I completely agree with you that weight should be given to the apparent findings of rigorous work . Absolutely. I also think it is a disservice to all of us if people are discouraged to approach unpopular ideas and ask questions about them for fear of mockery . Or that newcomers simply accept dogma of the day . That is anti science . Our greatest scientific discoveries usually shatter the pre existing concencus view (for the benefit of all ) Newtonian physics gives way to relativity, classic physics to quantum etc . \nAs you will know Cian , science is not about proving  things with absolute certainty it deals in probabilities . \nScience works to bring us to a place where we can say p< 0.05 . So imho we shouldn\u2019t loosely  present science as absolute and unchanging truths in service of quietening and/ or deriding people and/or their ideas . \nImho what is being missed in so doing is that it is those who dare to challenge dogma,  who challenge and constantly review empirical evidence that bring us the new discoveries . My point is less about discrediting null tests and more about celebrating people who dare to challenge dogma . And that science is also in support of those people . If young people / newcomers are to chase a few rabbit holes and cul de sacs for the will of exploration and finding things out for themselves , who would deny them that ? Those who probably did much the same thing themselves at the start of their journey into audio ? It certainly appears to be true that under observation and current technology the daws sum. Yet we are also at a moment in science where mathematicians are suggesting our reality may only be an avatar and time as a concept is outdated . In mind of these leading edges of scientific thought someone as clever as Jon challenging a consensus on nulling may or may not be genius . But laughing at or dismissing his and Aaron\u2019s and many others sense on it \u2026..doesn\u2019t serve any of us imho .",

Does anyone else experience a kind of uncertainty/mild anxiety about their work that might derive from the fact that you're not really specialized in a certain area? I feel like I'm not always as excited or confident about getting into a certain task not only because I know i'm not very good at it yet (which i know is all relative, I could still be exactly what someone else needs for something), but also because I know others are out there, sometimes in my personal circle, who are much better? For a little added detail, my fulltime career is as a voice actor, but I love mixing, and sometimes I produce some baby artists, engineer ADR and video game/commercial voiceover. This week i was asked to dialog edit an animated film, I have to comp vocals for someone's song, and there's always a litany of othere stuff, none of which I ever feel prepared to do so the work usually takes longer than I know it should. Maybe the answer is simply to stop trying to be everything to everyone, but honestly I'm terrified to put all my eggs into the voiceover basket even though it's what I've got the most momentum with.",

I'm considering switching to an email manager like *Mail* or *Thunderbird* because I have multiple Gmail accounts (personal, work, creative work, etc) and I want to access them all in one window.\n\n**But here's the thing I can't solve:** All of my incoming emails (useful, updates, promotions, notifications, etc) get dumped straight into my inbox. Suddenly my inbox goes from being empty to having 8000+ unread emails.\n\nI've become accustomed to Gmail's *categories*, which automatically files promotions, updates, social notifications, etc to their own tabs. This keeps my inbox tidy and focused. However it seems to be a proprietary feature that doesn't exist in all other email managers.\n\n**So. My question:** Has anyone found a way to make their email manager sort incoming mail into categories like this? Yes, I could manually create rules and filters to sort into folders. But the initial setup labor and ongoing upkeep is not something I am interested in doing at this time.",

Even though you can look at each account's inbox individually, it does put every accounts messages into the main inbox too.

It seems like streaming is about as easy as it\u2019s going to get, and I don\u2019t really hear any Spotify users with qualms about their experience.\n\nI do wonder if artists will become less partial to Spotify over time though. It seems like there are so many different metrics of success now (Spotify streams, instagram followers, tik tok followers are the main ones I think of) that aren\u2019t always mutually inclusive of each other. And I wonder if that takes a little weight off of streaming numbers being the only metric that legitimizes an artist. And I hear people like Ryan Tedder talk about the importance of \u201cworld building\u201d for artists now - I wonder if fans of artists will care more about being part of that artist\u2019s ecosystem than the artist\u2019s music being a part of their music library. I think of how K Pop bands sell crazy numbers of physical copies as an example. They can still stream the music but it seems like there are more variables now.\n\nThinking out loud a little bit, I might have just said absolutely nothing with a lot of words lol.",
