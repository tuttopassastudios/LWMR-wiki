Having only experienced studio work as a cottage industry up to that point, PP opened my eyes to avenues I could pursue that I wouldn\u2019t have known even existed otherwise (recording engineer is different to mixing engineer is different to producer is different to songwriter??!). It all seems very rudimentary now, but I was starting from literally nothing in a place with few (if any?) visible role models.\n\nI learned so much from it on a technical level - from basic stuff like what a Pultec is and how people use it (connecting the dots between my cracked Waves bundle - Puigtec and who tf JJP was), what \u201ca vocal chain\u201d might look like and the purpose of each stage\u2026\n\nTrue, the interviews did become unbearable, but there was a golden era between eps around 30-90 at a time when outside of working in the studio world, there weren\u2019t many other sources of good information from people who were really doing it.\n\nHuge appreciation for Dave, and I hope he and his family get the support they need.",

    "content": "In the midst of a kinda unique side quest at the moment - label pulls me in at an hourly rate with an artist (and good friend) that I\u2019ve mixed for many times because the production sessions were such a mess that they felt like they couldn\u2019t even finish the records until some light mixing and organization took place. Songs spread out between multiple project files, DAWs, laptops\u2026vocals tracked to mp3s with the ~50ms delay thing\u2026Some of these producers templates\u2026brilliant stuff. Saw one vocal travel through maybe 7 or 8 auxes and hit probably 4 different rvox\u2019s along the way. It was like a labyrinth of signal flow that was nearly impossible to follow (and once I deleted half the auxes and waves plugins, it started to come back to life). In short they\u2019re having me un-mix it, hand it back for some more production, then do the final mixes later this year. A true testament to the importance of organization and more importantly minimalist, straight forward session files. I wonder how often this need comes up and how feasible it is to be involved ahead of the handoff as a mixer these days. And before you frown at me for griping, this is an absolutely incredible project, many insanely talented musicians I respect. Very right brained, free flowing group. So it felt cool to be able to play more of a part on the project as the more left brained participant and see the stress relief happen in real time.",

Brauer is really tuned into the frequency I see reflected on here often and it\u2019s leading me down a really freeing and passionate path that\u2019s inspiring instinct and fun lead the way rather than thinking and obsessing. I have many thoughts from this week, happy to share whatever if anyone feels like that would be helpful. But I\u2019m equally happy to just take all the lessons from here and there and move forward with a fucking awesome renewed excitement for this work.

I would challenge you to reflect on where you started 2025 and where you are now and take inventory of what growth or lessons you experienced. \n\nThe most rewarding bits of this year for me wouldn\u2019t make sense to post about. Paid off my first business loan. Improved the efficiency of signal flow in my studio. Learned to fix some gear. Stood up for myself in a hard conversation with some assholes trying to rip me off. Got out of the UAD ecosystem. \n\nNone of that I\u2019m posting about or adding to a playlist, but it feels just as essential (or more) to my business than the songs that got released.",

But it took years of patiently learning the ropes at the highest level to be trusted by the folks in the highest circles. I look back upon that now and I\u2019m still amazed that I was paid to do that. It was essentially like a paid college degree in making records.\n\nSo now when I go into studios with a big client, I see the assistant through those eyes. I\u2019m kind but communicative. If they can hang in the back and figure out how I work, anticipate breaks \u2014 get the menu book ready \u2014 know that we\u2019re going to change gears \u2014 start setting up for that \u2014 then they get looped in. They get my running commentary on what techniques I\u2019m doing. They get the inside baseball\u2026 \u201cI wish they fired this fucking drummer\u201d. \n\nI agree with Ruairi that this type of coming up through the ranks is a loss for up and comers. It was tried and true way to make people understand the ins and outs of studio technique, etiquette, professionalism. I\u2019m glad I got to ride one of the last waves of it. I wouldn\u2019t be here making records at this level if it weren\u2019t for the opportunities I had at the bottom levels of the industry.",

There was a very \u201calive\u201d life to the hardware that really transformed the keys part -~~ the soundtoys sounded comparatively like a blurry stereo gauze around the sound (but can be cool as its own thing).~~ [*That was my memory this morning of what it sounded like in 2019 - see edit below though, I now disagree with my memory*] \n\nThe closest I got to the \u201cspirit\u201d of the hardware was the microshift section of the Ultrachannel strip. It\u2019s definitely not for everything, but on that occasion it made the most sense.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s interested I can share some of the channels (wurli, gtrs, and BVs) and the hardware H3000 returns I printed so you can see for yourself what gets you there.\n\n\n[*Out of interest I reopened the session just now and tried out Soundtoys Microshift again - it's not bad at all. I'd even say that somehow sonically it's closer to the hardware than Ultrachannel, but still I think Ultrachannel gets closer to the spirit/vibe/neurophysiological impact of the hardware H3000 patch.*\n\n*Here's the patch I made in Ultrachannel - if anyone wants the session with parts to compare, DM me: https://strongroomstudios-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ross_strongroom_com/EvlK_gdag9dFhrmOQasFPt0BCPTv0qnr3Hiu3dwoLx5DrQ?e=A2m9u7*]",

HOWEVER, that intro guitar tone, and only that intro guitar tone, was a direct mic on a tweed combo run through Audio Ease\u2019s Speakerphone plugin \ud83d\ude02. Sometimes fake works better than real. I needed the contrast between the intro, where he could bring it down to, and then where he was going by the end. That plug-in gave me the different color that sounded big, but didn\u2019t ruin the surprise of where the song was going to end up",

    "content": "This is something where you need to figure out your own path. There are certain rules you can go by, but if you're just starting out, I would forego metering and start wrapping your head around some reference tracks. If you're able, have another track (that you know translates well) that's in stylistic ballpark of the song you're working on play out of a separate set of inputs. If you can toggle between your mix and the reference on a monitor controller, this is the best. There's a plugin called Metric AB that you can put on your master buss that will help as well. Then set the level of your reference track to 0dBFS so it's playing back full volume, and try and work your mix up to that level of 'loudness'. You're not necessarily trying to ape the sonic characteristics of the reference, but it will help guide you in making decisions throughout the mix process that add to the overall sense of volume. This will be much more insightful than chasing a single LUFS value or having a bunch of analyzers.",

Not just the concept you're trying to teach (let's say compression, for example). \n\nNot only are they trying to understand the concept you're explaining, but they'll want to know how you opened up the plugin window, what the key command is, what plugin type you're choosing, what the exact name is, and what channel you're putting it on. They may be learning the software at the same time, which is a whole other mindset to juggle.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to clearly state what they should be focused on, and once they listen without using their eyes, then you can repeat it with the monitor on and show them *also* how to set up and use the tool. Reassure them that for now they can let go of trying to figure out the DAW (for example) and then you will double back around and demonstrate the implementation.",

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

I move slowly and make sure I understand before I move on. It may take two months to complete, but I'm steady with it and I do a little bit most days. It's common for me to transcribe notes from high-density talks that I want to learn from and revisit them often over the span of a week. I'm constantly printing out my notes and reading material so that they're easy to revisit throughout the week.\n\nI'm currently taking a project management course through MIT, which has been great. It's uncommon for me to do formal schooling these days, but this is work related and a direct application to my future capabilities that we thought would be beneficial for the company.\n\nWhen I buy a new plugin (rare) I set aside time to go through it and turn every knob and try each feature to see what it's capable of. Learning a tool on the spot is a good way to kill the creative flow, so I do the exploration up-front when possible.\n\nOften I'll have ideas for novel ways to use a tool (layering distortion, for example) and I'll set aside two hours to explore it and see what I find.\n\nThat said, I think my day-to-day may be quite different from a lot of folks here. My eggs aren't all in the business and pressures of record production, and so I rarely find myself buried in such commitments. I tend to keep \"normal\" business hours these days and keep a hard separation between my commitments and my leisure.\n\nIn fact I'd say that I'm actively structuring my life so that I can retain my leisure and don't find myself overwhelmed with commitments.

    "content": "My main tip for using Live live is try and replace as many third party plugins as you possibly can with stock, freeze as much as you can, and most of the latency you experience is going to be coming from internal delay compensation vs I/O latency.  If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

Watch your accumulated plugin latency like a miserly hawk and do what you can to use Ableton stock plugins when you can because they are incredibly stable within the DAW and the last think you want is A) for your session to crash during a show and B) you don't want to be troubleshooting a fussy set that was working fine yesterday when you have to be onstage in 15 minutes. That'll make you sweat bullets for sure. Been there.\n\nAlso *yes* to the Daniel Mintseris Ableton live set videos. If you're seriously considering using Ableton on stage with live instruments it's rich in strategies for streamlining an elaborate performance set.",

When doing it this way MD  stand-alone has the edge over the plug-in because it\u2019s all right there in front of me. It\u2019s easy to visually reference a quad tracked lead vocal, and then align and de ess or consonant 8 harmonies. That\u2019s where the stand-alone really shines, is massively dense stacks vocals like that, and not having to keep opening up a plug-in to change a different part or vibrato or formant of a particular track  of the stack or what not. Especially once you get the groove locked in on the lead, it\u2019s just so easy to make all other 30 tracks lock in with it. \n\nFor a solo vocal soul song? I\u2019m probably just audio suiting AT in graph mode in PT. It ultimately sounds the best.",

If you bought a Waves plugin 15 years ago, how long are they expected to provide support for the one time purchase? Given that operating systems and DAW updates are always going to provide a moving target, it doesn't seem unreasonable to have some sort of upgrade fee or plan for them to cover their costs in the development of updated software. I just think with Waves, their whole pricing model is on drugs and it's hard to attain any semblance of sanity from their upgrade plans.",

The update plans are annual now though, so it would have to be renewed annually if your OS was being updated with each release ( at least from my experience). I ran into that issues after one or two years with those plugins. But honestly I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m really happy with the plugins I\u2019ve subbed in to replace what I used in the past. My main tools are the MCDSP channel strip, some fabfilter plugins, soundtoys bundle, UAD, and a few other things here and there. I think Waves marketing convinced me to buy tools I really didn\u2019t need. But as a beginner at the time, plugin manufacturers can be pretty deceiptful in their marking strategy in my opinion. It wasn\u2019t until after buying a bunch of different things, that I realized what tools I truly needed long term.",

I can always HDMI I figure if I need the extra real estate.\n\nThe only acustica plug I run regularly is Ruby 2 - seems to cause pretty drastic spikes on the CPU short term in Ableton (running rosetta mode and VST3 by the way) but then it levels out.  In general I've been super impressed with the performance vs my desktop.  I'd say for my mixes it runs maybe 80% as well on large projects (75+ tracks, lots of processing) which was more than I was expecting.  Smaller projects and productions and softsynths it absolutely chews through compared to my desktop.\n\nWas just trying out a little mix in Studio One just on the 14\" and it felt very cramped to me.  I think it'd be hard to completely mix at this resolution but again it probably has more to do with what I'm used to.

Ill review this also. \n\n@David Fuller thank you v much for taking the time to write and explain that . Particularly your explanation of tube and FET circuits . Really great thanks. I suppose in a sense, if we think of the signal flow from mic through analogue electrical circuits , back out to analogue at a listeners speaker......I\u2019m fascinated with how sonic information and its identifying qualities (such as harmonic content of an instrument , and its pitch....and say for a vocalist for example .....how does the character of a consonant .....or a vowel...how is this encoded into an electrical circuit to then again be recreated into an identifiable analogue reproduction upon return to the world of sound waves ? How do we manipulate these harmonics in a controlled way electrically And how did we discover this ? It\u2019s imho mind blowing ......\n\nto your point about the complexity of understanding distortion , I feel like maybe this is what I\u2019m going to need to understand \n\n I need to find the answer in physics as to how can a voice be transmitted as an electron flow, then re rendered as a human voice again .....its  fascinating to think a voltage / current can carry the information that is someone\u2019s voice and the emotion of a performance \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.

The only tangible difference I know of is that VST3 is designed to only use CPU when audio is running through the plug-in. Can be quite handy in larger sessions. Though maybe AU has caught on to that by now.",

    "content": "In a space that small, as much absorption as you can have will help you. Do you have a bigger room to record in or do you need the isolation? You'll likely get better sonic results if you can find a room with some more volume... that will also allow you to play with position in front of the microphone. As far as the level you should record at, if you've got any half-decent mic pre than you can go into the computer pretty conservatively. Assuming you don't have a super noisy chain, there'll be plenty of headroom in a 24 bit recording to bring it up after the fact. If you're looking for numbers, I'd shoot to get things into your DAW at around -18 dBFS. Many of the plugins modeled after analog gear tend to be happier with that level (or less if you're unsure).",

Also, most of the songs I mix tend to be one\u2019s I\u2019ve written and produced as well, so hoping to cut down on session set-up time.\n\nSome of mine are an instant \u201cduck bus\u201d, which I picked up from Ian Kirkpatrick. It\u2019s a pre-loaded aux with something like LFO Tool or shaper box on it, so you can quickly route and uniformly make things side chain.\n\nAnother quick workflow thing I love is having Pro Tools audio playlists with a bunch of reverse sweeps, impacts and other transition fx/ear candy hidden and ready to go in the session, so you can quickly try out a bunch. \n\nI also have the trim plugin added as the first and last plugin on every new track preset, as I use them to quickly manage the gain in and out of each track and so I don\u2019t have to search for them constantly.\n\nOzone Spectral shaper on some music busses and as a replacement for Soothe on the mix bus has also been a real win (thanks Jon!) Although these sorta things aren\u2019t turned on whilst writing as they have a ton of latency.\n\nKeen to hear what you all find useful!",

I'm using the new computer solely for new ideas right now.\n\nThe software I'm not getting to work are the few Waves plugins I use, *Wavesfactory Spectre*, and... I think that's it? The big holdout for me was the NI Massive X synthesizer, which *just* got Rosetta compatibility *today*. That was probably the big \"can't live without\" thing for me.\n\nI even got my UA Apollo to work, though it seem to have an additional 2 ms or so of input latency, so I think it'll have to be optimized better.\n\nI haven't tried installing Pro Tools yet. Honestly, if Pro Tools never touches my new computer it will probably be better off for it. I loathe Digidesign's software.",

    "content": "Do you have any way of recording at home? You mention \"while you are not actually recording\". The best way to practice is to literally do it as often as possible even if it's by yourself. You won't train the social aspect, you won't really train problem solving of an external source (a guitarist with a particularly shitty amp or playing technique per-say), but you can certainly experiment endlessly on capturing sounds. Shootouts, micing techinques, it's pretty much endless. If you don't have a recording setup at home or are in an apartment where you can't be as loud as you'd want, I try to absorb as much information as I can. Podcasts (Andrew Talks to Awesome People / Unstoppable Recording Machine / Working Class Audio / Conversations Audio), Online articles, (Sound on Sound) GearSpace Forum Q+A, TapeOp interviews, Youtube Series (Making Records with EV, Sounds-Like-a-Drum), etc. These can be incredibly inspiring and keep your mind tuned into the recording process.  I sort of use this as my \"fix\" when I am not able to work actively on a project. Otherwise, what everyone else has said about mixing are perfect suggestions. Maybe set limitations like only using plugins you haven't used. or remove a plugin you are constantly using to force yourself out of a habit. Practice editing dramatically even if the track doesn't call for it so you can get your editing chops up.",

Main culprits are the original Neutron and Vocalsynth (which I was using a lot at the time).\n\nI figure that in this situation I\u2019m going to have to recreate some sounds (which is fine as I\u2019ll be reproducing some of the more dated elements anyway) but it got me thinking about future proofing sessions going forward. It\u2019s made me even consider not using certain plugins in my productions if it\u2019s likely they won\u2019t be supported in the future (*cough* izotope).\n\nI\u2019m sure the solution is as simple as \u2018print a multitrack when done\u2019 but if anyone has any other thoughts I\u2019m all ears!",

We obviously use transformers in electrical science and in analogue music and we talk about phase shift in both electrical science and audio engineering. I was speaking with my firm's supervisor about all this and the common terminology and he was pointing out that as audio engineers we use all the same terms because of course, audio engineering was founded from electrical engineering . What im very curious about is that in analogue circuits we transform sound pressure levels into electrcial circuits and voltages....which then become affected by these electrcial phenomena ......that often create pleasing artefacts once reconverted back to sound waves at the speaker (via overloading voltages and transformers and valves )",

I\u2019m looking at buying a M1 or M2 Macbook Pro and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019d be worth going up to 32 GB of ram from 16. I\u2019m doing mostly mixing and light production work. No need to run a billion instances of serum or anything like that but I do have a lot of plugins running most of the time and it\u2019d be nice not to feel like my computers about to blow up. Any advice would be appreciated.",

Has huge sine bass notes in a few sections that were chattering a bit with the short iZotope maximizer release. This mixer uses the same limiter setting on every mix and I copy it and work from non limited mix, sometimes tweaking slightly\n\nSo bass distortion sounds cool to me, but more importantly it was in the REF. So to my mind it\u2019s cool and in the artist\u2019s signpost of intention \u2026. But they wanted it clean (which was possible and pretty easy)\n\nI guess the message and the reason for putting it in general is that we\u2019re all under the gun with deadlines, and all through the process there can be a sense of it\u2019s just a demo, just a producer ref,. just a mix ref \u2026. we\u2019ll nail it later.

I feel like it has a lot of promise, but was quite cumbersome to integrate and very clunky, I just think most software should be pretty intuitive to get going.

I simply want to have 4 discrete paths to my ATC\u2019s and stereo subs and it wouldn\u2019t let me customize a simple 4ch layout to do that where it would enable bass management panels to handle crossovers. I had to select a 5.1 or 7.1.x channel at a minimum config then jerk around with routings to get it going places with crossover points. Feels like a missed opportunity. I think I\u2019m gonna hit them, I do think it has legs.\n\nYour point about additional latency was also very well noticed. Really could be great",

As one day , the artist will perform it live . I come from club and sound system culture , so the ultimate destination is a wall of speaker boxes \u2026..and in the end music has to be re inforced for public performance .

    "content": "Hey, I\u2019m not sure where to post this exactly, but I had an interesting experience the other day that I\u2019d like to share with the group and hopefully get some perspective on.\n\nI was touching up a track with a producer friend at the end of a writing session. Vocals and guitar recorded over a 2track beat. I typically throw a Waves L2 on my master, just to bring up the level for the rough bounce, never doing much more than a dB or two of gain reduction. In this case I had the threshold of the L2 set at -3.4. The producer said try -3.5, then back to -3.4, then -3.5\u2026 flipping back and forth seeing what he liked more. I couldn\u2019t hear a difference. (I should say that we weren\u2019t in a well treated room, working on some mid sized genelecs. It\u2019s a  setup neither of us is super familiar with.) He decided -3.4 was better and I was in disbelief that he could even hear a difference. I asked if I could do a blind test to see if he could tell which setting was which. He closed his eyes and I switched back and forth a bunch of times before landing on a setting, and he called it correct three times in a row. He said he could hear something in the kick drum but couldn\u2019t explain more than that.\nI need a sanity check. I know my ears aren\u2019t hall of fame, but I\u2019m still in disbelief that he was able to tell a .1dB difference in volume on the limiter.",

I don\u2019t know where you land in regards to engineering vs the other aspects of music you may gravitate towards.\n\nHope this helps!",

Kinda driving me a little crazy.\n\nEdit: Got confirmation from the artist and ME that it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s only on the singles she uploaded to distrokid before switching to the smaller distro, so she\u2019s reaching out to them. Beware the distro switch.",

    "content": "You can\u2019t boot a drive you use as a Time Machine backup directly as in the past. \n\nBut you can make an external disk bootable by installing macOS to an APFS disk via the regular installer or from macOS Recovery. \n\nYou could then restore a Time Machine backup to this bootable disk, and then boot your restored OS.\n\nOn Apple Silicon the install needs to be done from a port other than the device firmware update(DFU) port, easy to look up which one for your model. But you can boot from any port after. You\u2019ll need to change the security mode in the Startup Security Utility on the machine you are booting to Reduced Security, also just enable kernel extensions while you are there if you need for an interface like UAD etc.\n\nThis bootable OS will be specific to your Mac Model, as in, a m4 mbp installed external will not boot an m2 Mac mini or an m5 mbp etc. I\u2019m not sure if it needs to be the same specs, but that could easily be tested",
