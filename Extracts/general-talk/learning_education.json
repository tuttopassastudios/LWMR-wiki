It's no overstatement to say that you *are* this server and the reason for it's success.\n\nWe've got a very special community that's been built up over our short history and this place would fall apart if each and every one of us wasn't maintaining the level of excellence, understanding, kindness, and great discourse that this place is known for. We've got something special here.\n\nI love to see how welcoming you all are whenever we get someone new and how helpful we are at answering the questions of people at every stage of their journey. Hats off to the collective \"we\" and to the individuals who make this place great.\n\nAnd finally, thank you to @oaklandmatt for creating such a place. Thank you for everything that you've made here and for giving us a place to thrive and come to know one another.",

    "content": "Ok Long Post alert, but touches on a few things we harp on around here. \n\nSo my little bro is in town- we made dinner for one of his oldest friends who just moved to town with his wife. He\u2019s a fantastic mandolin player and his wife is a singer/songwriter. \n\nOf course I did the ol\u2019 studio walk through, listening to all the tunes on the ear calibration playlist, then let them play some of their own favs. Of course they\u2019re blown away and have never heard music like this etc. \n\nBut to drive the point home I show them a song @Rollmottle and I turned around in just over 24 hours. \u201cThe reason for the speakers & treatment etc is so we can make decisions quickly blah blah blah.\u201d  I pull up the session and we listen through and they\u2019re loving it- but I\u2019m noticing it doesn\u2019t have the 3D thing that all the other music we\u2019ve been listening to has. \n\nThen I show them the mastered version. An mp3. It\u2019s louder and better sounding and all, until the first BGV stack hits\u2026 then it\u2019s IMMERSIVE. We listened to the whole thing again just to enjoy the magic and notice all the ways the master improved it. So far beyond zapping resonances and making it loud, @Rollmottle made it sound\u2026 important. Made *me* sound like a good mixer. \n\nIt was heavier lifting for him cause I didn\u2019t have the benefit of time for fresh ears or to detail the vocal the way I normally would. Also had the good fortune of having @Ross Fortune on speed dial and on GMT to give it a listen at 5am PST. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re curious, or dubious, I\u2019ll DM files so you can hear what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nTL;DR: monitoring matters, fresh perspective matters. Don\u2019t produce mix *and* master your own shit.",

    "content": "Re; Brauer workshop\n\n-First 2 days were nothing technical, the 1st conversation he brought up was about TM and how meditation in general has helped him.\n-Everything is feel-based, most technical Q's for the first 2 and a half days got the same reply: \"It doesn't matter to me, i don't care what the thing is long as it feels good\". \n-MHB actually seems to leave the planet while he's mixing, it's wild how immediate he gets into that space. Seemed to go way past \"i love mixing and here's all the reasons i'm the shit\" and it was inspiring to see the ego leave the equation. His decades of experience are playing directly into his ability to access the story of the song and present it in a compelling, live-feeling way. He mixes from inside the song and performs. Well, he does discovery, then shapes the sounds, then performs just about everything on faders.\n-The biggest wake up call to me is that a lot of moves i've made on mixes did not have a good reason behind them. So continuing to ask \"why\" as I work is gonna be important, because I have to start catching myself and adjusting when the answer to \"why\" is \"because someone said this preset is cool\" or \"because this is what I do to a vocal/guitar/drums\". I feel music very deeply, it's why i got into this, but I feel like i've been poisoned against trusting that instinct and convinced that what we do is a technical job. I'm done being an observer of the art, i want to be bold.\n-It's critical to build trust with clients right away, you can't assume anything in what they understand about how you feel. Telling them you love the song and you're excited to mix it is important, and never blaming production/artist/anything else for the mix being less than what it should be. never okay to say \"i did my best\", because that gives you an out and implies somebody else could do it better\n-Therefore, you must believe when you sit down to mix that nobody is gonna interpret this song better than you.\n-Generally i'm skeptical to just take on someone else's \"method\" and start operating in that space just becuase of the success they've had with it. Putting this week into practice is going to mean using his template to get reps in, listening and feeling and interacting in a new way and letting my brain \"level up\", if you will, then zooming out and making it my own.\n\n\nI can distill this more and want to share about a couple other specifics, but I just realized I grabbed someone else's notebook by mistake when I left on the last day so I'll need to have them mail mine back to me.",

We'll practice things for years that you wouldn't consider investing an hour in. You can imagine spending half of your life under a bridge learning to play sax like Sonny Rollins, but you can't imagine spending five minutes learning to drop a palmed cell phone into a little pocket behind a cardboard cut out of Chris Angel while hanging across around its neck and talking a mile a minute without the slightest pause. I had to practice that a lot. A lot more than you can imagine. I had to practice it a lot more than you think it's worth. Our big secret is that it's worth more to us to do our tricks then you can even imagine. Our deep secret is simply misplaced priorities.\"",

I was initially on the fence, but am very glad I went. \n\nJon & Teezio were amazing together. I don't know how often MWTM does workshops with two engineers, but it really enriched the experience for me. It was actually comical how different their perspectives were on mixing, the business side, motivation for the work, lifestyle, etc... This created fascinating debate / conversation in the group. The Grammy nominations were announced while we were all together and we got to celebrate Jon & Teezio as a group for their I think combined 6 or 7 nominations. They brought in a bucket of champaign. All this after having gone through the sessions for said grammy nominated work earlier in the week. 10 / 10.\n\nRue Boyer studios is actually insane. Probably the best room I've been in.\n\nThere were attendees from all over the world. We ended up sharing mixes and receiving feedback from J&T. Hearing and sharing records in the same room with the people who made them with context provided from varying countries, cultures, genres, and scenes was as enlightening a music listening experience as I'm likely to have for the rest of my life.\n\nSo if anyone else here is on the fence in the future. Here's a tiny nudge.",

You become enchanted with the clever contortions of your fingertips but stop really connecting with their effect in the world\n\nThis is what obsession with sound and tones can become. Mistaking the sounds we use to create feelings in our bodies, hearts and minds for an end goal unto themselves\n\nSo what does graduating look like? It doesn\u2019t mean forgetting how to mic a kit or tune a vocal. It doesn\u2019t necessarily  mean minimalism. It doesn\u2019t really mean anything except focussing on what matters; how the sounds make you and hopefully your audience feel. This is the basis of my repeated hope for people to \u201cListen like a 15 year old girl\u201d. She doesn\u2019t care about sound, she cares how it makes her *feel* \n\nAn argument for feel is often viewed as an argument *against* great sound or *for* \u201cphoning it in\u201d which of course makes no sense. Many things can sound AND feel great, as long as you keep your eyes on the shadow on the wall, and not on your fingers\u2026.",

It all seems very rudimentary now, but I was starting from literally nothing in a place with few (if any?) visible role models.\n\nI learned so much from it on a technical level - from basic stuff like what a Pultec is and how people use it (connecting the dots between my cracked Waves bundle - Puigtec and who tf JJP was), what \u201ca vocal chain\u201d might look like and the purpose of each stage\u2026\n\nTrue, the interviews did become unbearable, but there was a golden era between eps around 30-90 at a time when outside of working in the studio world, there weren\u2019t many other sources of good information from people who were really doing it.\n\nHuge appreciation for Dave, and I hope he and his family get the support they need.",

On mixing the Rage Renegades album with Rick Rubin: \n\n\"Rick called me up after I worked on Fiona Apple \"When The Pawn..\". I learned a lot from him, primarily how to work from instinct instead of intellect. He would often make mix suggestions which I thought were bad ideas but I would of course do them because it's what he wanted, and they worked. He really did listen like a teenager, it was always simply whether or not he was getting off on something. If he wasn't, he'd make very clear suggestions on how to make something better. Sometimes he'd just say the mix sucked and to start over (only once). Sometimes the recording itself had issues and he would just deal with what's there. I think that turned into a serious strength of his- working with what's in front of him. We still keep in touch from time to time\"",

That\u2019s niching down a little too hard a little too early.\n\nI think it\u2019s our job to find the essence within something and maximally bring that essence out. Often these \u201ctaste mismatch\u201d issues come across to me as missing that essence within the thing you\u2019re working on and trying to make it something that it essentially isn\u2019t. ie. A wannabe Max Martin working with a wannabe mitski and the producer complaining that the artist\u2019s suggestions are making the production hashy and the artist complaining that the producer\u2019s production choices don\u2019t convey enough emotion. \n\nIt\u2019s talking past each-other and not really collaborating. You aren\u2019t learning to truly love what your partner loves, which IMO is frankly a big part of the job.",

Despite his very explicit statements about hating political division, it has of course been wildly politicized because everything on the internet is these days.\n\nThe second song is a white male country singer covering a black lesbian female's iconic song ALSO about class. Talk about intersectionality...\n\nThe third song is the longest running solo male #1 song on the Hot 100 from the biggest star in country music (and really one of the biggest stars in the world... just, again, not covered by the current fashion of mainstream culture). It's a kinda-country-but-kinda-just-pop song co-written by the biggest country writer in history (Ashley Gorley) as well as once-rapper-and-Dr-luke-protege J Kash.\n\nThe rest of the chart is interesting too. #4 is a four year old taylor swift song that has gained traction online from her current tour so the label started pushing it as a single. \n\nThere are two Olivia Rodrigo songs, signaling a true new superstar.\n\nThere are two songs from the Barbie soundtrack. In a \"dying\" movie industry currently on strike, when is the last time two songs from a movie soundtrack have been in the top 10? I dunno.\n\nAnd lastly, there's only 1 trap song. The majority of these songs are people playing real instruments and writing more \"classic\" singer-songwriter songs. Rap music is really having a lull after a decade of dominance.",

    "content": "\"Sorry about the late night duplicate file, I did this track after six other people because I'm rushing as a team player.   I delivered as promised up front as we are all in overtime now to make it great.  *CLIENT* is happy with your work and with mine and we are all working overtime together.   Apologies also, I know there were some annoying ticks in there with some of the revised files. Still not sure why this one session did that. \n\nOf course I don't listen to every single file, post rendering.   We render and send 500-1000 files a month with the revisions on the 200-300 monthly songs that I do.  Team players don't ask such things on CC.  I work usually 7 days a week for 40-50 people a month, and making them happy with great masters is job #1.  Perfectionism is not a part of that process.    Software makes mistake, and that's ok.    People make mistakes and that's ok.   Mixes and masters should never aim for perfect, they should aim to connect, aim for humanity.  \n\nPerfection is not the goal here, it's musicality and teamwork.  I'm sorry your ears suffered that horrible popping, but please, be cool. \"",

The vibe of the discord is to engage in discussion about all aspects of record-making life, but just posting random recording tutorial videos doesn't really serve this dialog... in fact it disconnects the community and jams up the conversation. It's cool to share stuff, but perhaps at a slower pace with some sort of context and prompt for discussion. Thanks!",

Your goal is to set the sliders to maximize your wellbeing (in the broadest sense) and the wellbeing of those close to  you. The sliders are in effect zero sum, in that the closer you are to one end then less you have of the attribute on the other end. Let\u2019s set the time horizon to 25 years and acknowledge the seemingly increasing pace of change in the world\n\nOk, the sliders \u2026\n\n**#1 Classics vs Cutting Edge**\nOn this slider 0 represents maximum knowledge in a classical sense - literature, math, mythology, fundamental accepted basics in Biology/Chemistry/Physics etc etc. 10 represents complete literacy in the cutting edge of culture, science and technology - from memes and Reddit culture to AI to synthetic biology and Blockchain etc etc \n\n**#2 Specialist vs Generalist**\nHere 0 represents a very deep and specific knowledge of a chosen field (could be a doctor or a producer) vs 10 representing a modern Jack of all trades who knows a little bit about a lot of things \n\n**#3 Short Term vs Long Term**\nOn the slider 0 represents a disposition all about short term wins, fast plays that close out over a year vs 10 representing long investments in a given idea/field/belief system\n\nIt goes without saying that the zero sum aspect here is artificial, you can of course have some long term plays happening alongside some short term, but it\u2019s just to get the juices flowing",

I also liked what he had to say on the information he's unintentionally prescribed in past live videos and the Peter Attia quote -- many times i've wondered if a new engineer hears \"I don't compress\" wihtout any context and goes ok, compression is cancelled, but really that was a thing specific to Jon's brain at that time. though yea, a lot of people could get away with compressing *less* lol",

Negotiating alignment.\"\n\nSimply based on the way I've framed this question, it's probably pretty clear that I belong to the \"peer-reviewing ideas\" school of thought (mostly). I love to throw stuff out there, even if I don't believe it. I want to stress test it.\n\nI can certainly appreciate conversation as a tool for aligning people on a belief or course of action, but it's got me wondering about how many of us are playing completely different games when we're having a conversation, and what other games are there? Do y'all think differently?",

Mine is more focused on how I want to hear (or rather deeply understand how I'm hearing) every day as close to consistent as possible, given we are human of course.\n\nMy 2 cents (which of course is just my experience): \n\nSome sort of routine before you work. Mine is that I wake up almost exactly at the same time every day, will work out at similar times (if possible), literally eat the same thing basically every day before during the work day, coffee at similar times, have  the same routine when I sit down to start work. Not all of that is possible or useful for everyone, but I think we can all find something that would focus us in a way that's useful and ablet to be put into practice for us.\n\nTruly I find it helps a lot. We are physical beings, how our systems and bodies interact can definitely matter, especially in our ability to be available to the music.\n\nThat said, sometimes things happen and you gotta go. You will be tired, stressed, whatever. You have to do excellent work under those conditions too, it might be the most important skill if we are being honest about making a career of this. So training specifically for when you feel rough is definitely something I personally find important.  Which is where physically training helps, it's a way to force yourself into (fake) adversity and train response\n\n@Slow Hand I know you know all this, just my experience",

    "content": "I would say most songs I\u2019ve produced/written have taken about a week total time (30-50 hours) from inception to mixing/mastering. This kind of timing comes with repetition and developing your focus to be able to work clearly and with intention. I used to work on songs to make progress but now I work on songs to finish them - that was an important mindset change that I needed to make to get stuff done and finished. Also learning to not be so precious with every song has also helped a ton with writing and finishing more tracks",

The worst lectures (when I started) were just dense information with very little active element for the students. They had the info presented to them so that was learning, right? Of course, that was the wrong approach, and the more i\u2019ve just provided broad themes to the group - i.e. make the sounds in front of you \u201cangry, happy, distant, close\u201d or \u201cwe will record/mix/master an EP within the next few weeks\u201d the better the sessions go, and the more inquistive the students are to uncover the \u201clearning\u201d as they are doing.  I find making a fool of myself (\u201centertainment\u201d) helps with this as it\u2019s a useful tool to disarm the groups and build rapport. The more you can encourage students to learn from each other, and share the learning - prompted by me, the better the outcome is for everyone.",

I move slowly and make sure I understand before I move on. It may take two months to complete, but I'm steady with it and I do a little bit most days. It's common for me to transcribe notes from high-density talks that I want to learn from and revisit them often over the span of a week. I'm constantly printing out my notes and reading material so that they're easy to revisit throughout the week.\n\nI'm currently taking a project management course through MIT, which has been great. It's uncommon for me to do formal schooling these days, but this is work related and a direct application to my future capabilities that we thought would be beneficial for the company.\n\nWhen I buy a new plugin (rare) I set aside time to go through it and turn every knob and try each feature to see what it's capable of. Learning a tool on the spot is a good way to kill the creative flow, so I do the exploration up-front when possible.\n\nOften I'll have ideas for novel ways to use a tool (layering distortion, for example) and I'll set aside two hours to explore it and see what I find.\n\nThat said, I think my day-to-day may be quite different from a lot of folks here. My eggs aren't all in the business and pressures of record production, and so I rarely find myself buried in such commitments. I tend to keep \"normal\" business hours these days and keep a hard separation between my commitments and my leisure.\n\nIn fact I'd say that I'm actively structuring my life so that I can retain my leisure and don't find myself overwhelmed with commitments. That's a whole other story, though.",

In the end, his stupid ego kinda killed the show. It was really annoying how he kept interrupting all the time and talking way more than Dave or the guest, about random shit that had nothing to do with the conversation. Fucking terrible.\n\nBUT I can\u2019t forget that back in the day, Pensado\u2019s Place was one of the very few places where you could actually see your mixing heroes talk about making records. Even when the interviews were pretty bad like 85% of the time, I still had great moments watching Eric Valentine, Tchad Blake, JMJ, Ken Andrews, etc\u2026 and I learned some useful stuff too.\n\nI\u2019m from a small village in Northwest Spain (BTW, I heard Pensado has family roots here), and I had zero access to any info about how real records were made. So when I discovered Pensado\u2019s Place, it was huge for me. Big thanks to Dave!! And I wish him nothing but the best in this sad new chapter.

    "content": "My main tip for using Live live is try and replace as many third party plugins as you possibly can with stock, freeze as much as you can, and most of the latency you experience is going to be coming from internal delay compensation vs I/O latency.  If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

    "content": "Yes. The same way you do anything in life you want to get good at. Spend a shit load of time doing that thing. There really are no hacks or work arounds if you want to actually get good. An easy free way to do it is just learn as many songs as you can. If you want to really be proficient in the musical language I would recommend learning stuff by ear. It takes a lot longer than looking up tutorials or sheet music. But I promise you will develop your ears infinitely more. Specially in the beginning. Music is a language. Every human being learns to speak and converse before they learn how to spell and know the rules of grammar. Learning theory will only let you put names to sounds so that you can convey musical ideas to their people. Contrary to what a lot of people think, there are no rules, but there are a lot of conventions and traditions, but they keep changing and have lots of exceptions. Learning a shit ton of songs on whatever instrument you choose, will teach you what those conventions are and how to use them. \n\nIn the beginning it\u2019s good to just learn every song you like as well as you can, because it will help keep you motivated as you like the music. Then after a while you will probably want to branch out and try stuff you\u2019ve never listened to or enjoyed before just to challenge yourself. \n\nThe most musical people I know, are the people who wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a Caugmented#9 but can listen to a song once and play it nearly perfectly, because their ears and musical language is so developed from playing a fuck lot of music and not spending time reading about it or watching endless tutorials.",

There\u2019s no point worrying about something because if you can\u2019t change it why worry and if you can, change it so you don\u2019t have too. A huge simplification but something I find helpful with dealing with tough times in a studio. \n\nYou can get that weird moment in a session when something goes wrong  usually the best course of action is to be a positive and hopeful force for the band or artist to rely on. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this sorted as quickly as possible and get back to work\u201d\nDeep down I don\u2019t think anyone really thinks you\u2019re responsible for what ever happened, they\u2019re just looking for a solution. Except of course Trevor, Trevor knows you did it and he\u2019s mad. \n\nLol but really sessions are emotionally intense situations and places and sometimes that can boil up in interesting ways.",

Having started as an intern, becoming an assistant after a few sessions and only later into engineering new projects and running my own sessions at the studio I work at nowadays, it's really clear to me that is you succeed at being a good assistant, people will trust you and you will be blessed with an opportunity to learn and evolve in a totally different and better way... I still assist some of the my colleague senior engineers and engineers that come to the studio for their own sessions, and I'm always eager to be on that spot... If you're that good and keep your mouth shut, you can only win - either by knowing the coolest people in the industry, by learning the craft, by learning how different people do their thing, different mindsets... And you REALLY learn what it takes for a session to run smoothly and for people to be comfortable in the studio, which will probably be the best skill you'll ever develop in this career... \n\nBeing an assistant is great, and all the assistants I know are usually the coolest people to hang with (and yes, I'm including myself, of course \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude02)",

There is also a lot of pushing and pulling the artists to fit their expectations instead of serving the art and letting nature take its course. Specifically theres a lot of \"I can't wait to help you realize the full expression of your music and art when we work together!!!!!!!!\" kind of vibe which is great internally but puts off older artists a little bit. I've seen it a lot over the last couple years with young producers and engineers and I wonder if its because of the pandemic, honestly. The whole \"check list to success\" thing is another good point. Some things are not easily repeatable or scalable with the expectation of the same result every time.",

    "content": "From my experience of going to music school and taking a whole bunch of courses that are all over the place in terms of lane of focus- school can offer almost too much. It helps to take some time to digest the information, I had this issue when I was in college and had a chat with some of the graduates and they said it took them years after graduating to decompose information that was learned. If you have doubts on if you should continue it may be useful to take some time off and spend on doing what you wanted to do, continuing to connect with people, or even just take breaks altogether to take a breeze of fresh air, live in outside world. Being in school kind of made me live in a bubble and getting out of that was really precious to me. \n\nDegree is just a piece of paper but academic settings can widen horizons of what you can access on your own in the future without having to rely on someone to feed the knowledge/information. It was very chaotic when I took a whole bunch of unrelated courses in college but they all offered me wide insights on what I could dig deeper into in the future. Did I transform as much as others that focused on one lane (eg. engineering) - then I would say no but I created my own program to gain things that would take me more than a decade to have access to. I wasn\u2019t able to retain everything but it unlocked the ways so I can go there when I need to. \n\nIt always sucked having no time to work on my own stuff, but I saw it as a training period  of my life rather than practical period of life. \n\nMy case is slightly different than yours because I went to college straight without having much real world experience. But TLDR; I think semester or a year off would give you what you need without aborting any of the options!",

The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nOf course there are going to be bell ends from every country (and there were plenty of exceptions - I've had many incredible sessions with North American clients, and some gross sessions with UK clients too), but it happened enough to wonder whether maybe it's a cultural thing?\n\nDoes this hold water with you US folks\u2019 experience? FWIW, I can\u2019t imagine anyone in this Discord treating anyone like that, let alone their colleagues. And of course, my personal experience is probably weighted 80/20 UK/international.",

In hindsight, it was incredibly formative for me that ear training practice and actual theoretical/sheet music knowledge always came alongside the practical element of sitting at keys and performing the pieces I was assigned that week.\n\nI like the idea of breaking down modern pop structure, I like the idea of covering signal flow a lot. I think you can teach and test signal flow in theory while allowing someone to practice their recording technique by mimicking the song structure of their favorite pop song. I\u2019m not proposing that as an actual coursework suggestion (I doubt most would be ready for that week one) but just as a thought for course organization",

Instead of explaining, it\u2019s better to do it and show it.\n\nMy humble take: our job is not necessarily doing what we\u2019re told. it is to take their vision, and take it to a place where they could say \u201cwow- I didn\u2019t know this is what I wanted but this is what I want now\u201d. Which I think is the taste and perspective factor. \n\nIt is case by case of course and some artists could come in with A to Z manual of what they want, which can be cool- or not. I personally find those boring, unless I really admire their vision and it just feel like an honor to be a part of it. I think being a yes man can be a quick way to become dispensable. But someone who is willing to serve by giving you some friction that can turn into some heat \ud83d\udd25 can be someone they find trustworthy and interesting. It\u2019s case by case dependent, some people need perfect aerodynamics to accelerate their vision, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily being a yes man- but rather about just being the right fit for the project and being someone who is fully on board to do what they are asking. \n\nBut I think more importantly- it\u2019s okay to miss. If they don\u2019t like it - then scrap it or give it another go. And it\u2019s also fine if you end up not being the one for the project",

You'd think \"well of course all the sample libraries I bought can do that just as well\"  but not imxp....  its that the sample libraries can do \"an adequate\" job and satisfythe need.  But once you hire world-class players and play it live into mics....  for me it was instantly \"we could've bought every sample library and programmed for days but never gotten this quality\" in the tiny details.  The bow sounds. The players breathing together. Their adaptation to dynamics. The aleatoric sections where advanced techniques were improvised. Samples can be amazing and do things humans can't...  but the inverse is also true.  There are many context where it's got to be live players, or else your track is just \"adequate\"",

It's inspiring to see him play with so much care and attention to feel.\n\nI loved hearing him talk about Mutt Lange's approach and how patient Mutt was with every part. Making the players play again and again while waiting for the right confluence of feel to come together before moving on. There's so much care for the moment. That pace is antithetical to the way things are often done today. Understandably so.\n\nOf course, Dann also expresses the feelings of doubt that anyone would go through in his position; wondering what it was about him that wasn't good enough for the take. So I think it's good that Mutt was up-front with the players about how they were going to approach it, which could allow the players to stop thinking about their abilities and sink into the right headspace for such a long endeavor as Mutt explored.",

    "content": "I can understand the trepidation here. Now that Canva own Affinity, it's not yet clear what their strategy is. My guess is that there are a few reasons for this play:\n\n1. Affinity Studio is now a loss leader for Canva's other offerings, like their (just announced) supplemental AI tool set or their enterprise plans, which I suspect are a big portion of their income compared to their Affinity suite licenses.\n\n2. It eats into Adobe's market share. Making a very competitive alternative to Adobe's flagship software and then offering it for free encourages adoption by users who are ready to jump ship from their Adobe subscriptions or who need software like this and are fine without Adobe's cutting-edge tools (like me).\n\nThere are some positive examples of high-level *free* software that is continues to thrive with no sign of being abandoned, or compromised. Like DaVinci Resolve or Reaper (which is effectively free). There are also some great examples of open source software getting a new lease on life by their steward companies. Namely Musescore and Audacity's recent revamps. \n\nNow Affinity isn't open source, but Musegroup have a large full-time development team that seem to be getting by just fine developing what is effectively free software. If they can do it, then Affinity likely can.\n\nHere's hoping Canva have done the math right before setting out on this course.",

    "content": "@peterlabberton i don't know that this is true about lumbar support. the article you sent seems to say that people need lumbar support because they have weak back muscles and then compensate by hunching. i've read/ heard/ felt that having strong back muscles and having a backless chair is great if you have adequate strength. this is why people talk about exercise balls being so great.\n\nperhaps the key is getting your core/ posterior chain strong? there are tons of ways to do this but i love kettlebell swings myself. \n\ni use a drum throne now rather than the herman miller. a solid workout routine and stretching, combined with drum throne has reduced my back and neck pain tremendously.\n\nof course i don't know what of that is chair, posture, strength, flexibility, and mindfulness... and i'm definitely not a doctor!",

Overall, i love recording so its not a chore, but sometimes it seems like the artist is getting in their own (and my \"producers's) way)   and  so again, I really appreciate you both sharing your strategies for handling these moments.",

What i would worry about is connecting your vocal chords to your ears and brain. technique and breathing isn't something to worry about just yet. A teacher/mentor can be great for guidance. But they can be expensive. A few lessons could def put you in a direction. I would start with ear training learning to hear melodies. Usually when people are unable to hit a note it has less to do with technique and more to do with their ability to decern pitch and notes. \n\nStarting out is always tough, but start by singing everyday, sing along to your favourite songs. also try and pull up a piano and press a key and then sing the note, then press another key and sing that note, this will teach you to actively target notes with your voice/ears. Learn to sing simple songs on your own without any backing tracks or music. Nursery rhymes are great, they are simple and a lot of people have them internalised. When you get some more confidance, try and have a static chord or note, and sing different notes on top of it and see how the different notes feel / sound and really internalise that.",

I have two visual meters while I mix... a janky old Goldline RTA analyzer and a TC Electronics Clarity. The RTA is useful for quick visual cues of kick to snare balance, how subby something really is, or when I'm working out phase relationships between drum mics... I can quickly glance to help aid with decision making. It's not necessary for me to mix, but I've had it for 15 years and it helps me make certain technical decisions quicker. The Clarity is very useful for the loudness radar. I basically set a guide LUFS (in my case, I'm usually shooting for -9) and you get a great visual representation of where you're at over the course of the song. Its especially useful to avoid fader creep... where I might nail the dynamics and loudness in the earlier parts of the song, but might overlook the last chorus being significantly louder, and in some cases, more squashed than it needs to be. I'm also an LCR panning guy, and it has a 'balance-o-meter' feature that has a cool weighted algorithm for determining if your mix is leaning left or right.",

I spent awhile asking it to code some things for me and it did so impressively, while leaving bits in the code that explained what it was doing. I can see that being massively useful for bug-hunting, but also as a learning tool. I was fascinated when I asked it to code me a GUI for this fake program and it complied.

We obviously use transformers in electrical science and in analogue music and we talk about phase shift in both electrical science and audio engineering. I was speaking with my firm's supervisor about all this and the common terminology and he was pointing out that as audio engineers we use all the same terms because of course, audio engineering was founded from electrical engineering . What im very curious about is that in analogue circuits we transform sound pressure levels into electrcial circuits and voltages....which then become affected by these electrcial phenomena ......that often create pleasing artefacts once reconverted back to sound waves at the speaker (via overloading voltages and transformers and valves )",

And of course maybe that\u2019s what I need to do to get to the point I want to be, but I\u2019d rather do it for no money and have more freedom in controlling my portfolio and having more potential long term returns. \n\nAll of your points are valid points though",

Things that give certain people a head start on different crafts can probably be analyzed into different components. While \u201ceither you have it or you don\u2019t\u201d can lead to defeatist thinking, I believe seeing them as a make up of different components can really bring out individuals\u2019 best self. \n\nwe all have our fortes, but not everyone is able to break them down and integrate the different strengths to create synergy. And the \u201ctalented\u201d individuals are the ones who has integrated the different strengths, whether it was through deliberate discoveries or something that was given to them circumstantially. I believe rephrasing \u2018innate talent\u2019 to something like \u2018natural qualities/traits\u2019 can lead to more freedom and more useful perspective than \u201cI could never be like X\u201d - because of course you can\u2019t, you are not X. \n\nWhich brings back to what you were saying about the value of  journey over the prize",

What\u2019s the measurable difference between Yo-Yo Ma and your uncle?\n\nMy gut feeling is that most of talent comes down to commitment/focus (interest in the craft) and learning styles, and then culture and early exposure mold that into an affinity.\n\nSome people will suck at an art form, put in the work, and then not suck anymore. Some will be born with a brain that\u2019s wired to seeing shapes, and find it easy to visualize patterns on a guitar neck. Some will be auditory learners and may find it easier to learn to identify intervals by ear.\n\nAnd then some people will grow up singing or playing in church, and those people get the cheat codes from a *very* young age while their brains are still spongey, learning things like their first language. Of course they weren\u2019t born playing the organ, but it can look that way from the outside.\n\nIt seems both mystical and defeatist when people who don\u2019t think they have talent talk about people who do\u2014almost like an excuse.

We talked about a bunch of stuff but one of the themes we explored was the idea that one needs a \u201cportfolio\u201d of slick & great sounding work to get hired\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided that then it becomes the focus, and changes the way things feel and the way decisions about time, who you work with etc get made. Concepts like \u201cI\u2019ll suck it up and work for free but *then* I will have a singular \u201cgood track\u201d for my portfolio\u201d. Of course there are exceptions but it feels to me that there\u2019s something very constricting and materialist about this way of being in the world. There can be a tension between what the artist wants or what the song wants to be and what makes you look \u201cgood\u201d in your portfolio - they want mono and grimy but you want wide/lush/impressive\n\nIn our jam I proposed a kind of thought experiment, an end of the line or extreme of the \u201cneed portfolio\u201d way of thinking\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say you are here, a young writer, producer, mixer. You\u2019ve been doing it 3 or 4 years. You feel that one of the reasons you are not getting hired, getting shots or getting paid well is that there isn\u2019t a body of work for a potential client to judge you by. Ok, here\u2019s comes the magic trick. I\u2019m going to grant you a genie wish portfolio! 5 killer tracks with  great collaborators. Not hot 100 #1 but the kind of work that you really feel would represent you best in the world. Boom. There it is\u2026\n\nSo now what? You get some DMs and sessions start happening. But you\u2019re not ready. You\u2019re not fit for game day. You\u2019re in over your head, and don\u2019t have the fluency, the experience, the reps and the humblings that build a great music business pro. In short you\u2019re not ready for the opportunities the genie wish portfolio granted you",

Of course if there is something that is very noticeable that can't be resolved convincingly, I will absolutely flag it. Truly, I want the art to be the best it can and almost every single person I've worked with agrees.\n\nBUT -- why wouldn't you just want me to remove a click, attenuate an s, etc? Even did one today where I was removing some high end on just a few clap hits, easy in RX.  Attenuating down the volume of a breath, whatever. Easy. Almost always the result is indistinguishable from you removing it on your end. Then you don't have to reprint, etc etc, the artist gets it faster, everyone wins.\n\nThen there is also the issue of where the click or artifact is actually coming from. Lead vocal? Backgrounds? One of 15 of the background stacks? So much easier for me to just zap the issue on my end from the stereo file. Again, with all this being that the result is equal (and oftentimes better I'd argue)\n\nObviously if the edit is in the way of connection to the song or it genuinely would sound better as an edit in the mix, we do that. But even something like bridging a bad edit that has a space in an s, etc can be done well with spectral repair replace!",

As someone with a diploma from a music program I don't know that it was the best investment in the long run. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I learned a *lot* and got a great education, but it was a lot of money to spend for learning to make records, and I'm not sure - with hindsight - that I'd do it the same way. There are other programs/paths that could give great results, so I would advise others to heavily consider if it's the best use of their money.\n\nThat said, it sounds like the formal qualification (the diploma) is a big motivator here.

I find the more busy I am with client work, the less time I'm able to dedicate to this stuff and I'm feeling like I might benefit from putting aside 2-3 hours a week to get in the zone with it. I learn a hell of a lot on here from the discussions everyone's having, but some quiet solo development time would be a good thing and I'm interested in hearing how you folks approach it (if at all)...",

    "content": "I was recently inspired after going to the cinema to see *A Complete Unkown*, the movie memoir about Bob Dylan; partially by Bob's story, but also by Timothy Chalomee's performance as Bob. All of the shots of him performing in the movie were fully live - which is an impressive feat by itself - but even more impressive that he apparently wasn't much of a musician before making the movie. I didnt know much about Timothy before this, so I watched his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's YouTube channel. One thing I found really interesting was how available he made himself to learning the role. For example, he didn't turn his phone on for 3 months straight. Got me thinking about how much I can get distracted during the day, and how these distractions can get in the way of me actually giving 100% to the art that I'm working on. I'm sure you all can imagine how the distractions in your own life can effect your work. Might be TikTok videos, might be discord, might be lusting over getting new converters or monitors or guitars, etc, you get the idea. So I guess what I'm saying here is that if I want to compete with the best, maybe I have to understand how to impliment systems in my life that allows me to be more available to the things that I am working on. I want it to be like lifiting a heavy weight at the gym - at the bottom of a heavy squat, you've no choice but to focus on pushing the bar back up with good form, cos that think will break you otherwise. There's a certain thing that happens in your brain when you're forced to only think about one thing for a prolonged, or even short period. It's something akin to meditating. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is if anyone has ever given this subject any thought before, and if anyone has ever done anything to get better at these things? I'm still not sure if all this only makes sense inside my own head.",

    "content": "Thank you all for chiming in on this, it really got me thinking! I took some time to dig deeper into my uncomfort with this topic and I think it\u2019s really just about the concept of a \u201cpersonality trait\u201d. Maybe we can jam a little on it.\n\nI had this example in mind:\nLet\u2019s say we meet someone for the first time and while we\u2019re interacting I gather that this person seems like a \u201chappy person\u201d, they\u2019re smiling, giving off warm vibes and are kind. We keep on meeting this person and the experience repeats itself. So the more we meet, the more our idea that this person must be a \u201chappy person\u201d solidifies. We know of course that this is an abstraction and that the person is probably going to be sad, angry, etc. at times. \n\nNow let\u2019s say we think, man I really liked this person they are so easy to deal with, I enjoyed every bit of our interaction. I wish more people would be like that! And there you go. Now you are set to figure out all the details about happiness, the factors that make a \u201chappy person\u201d a \u201chappy person\u201d. The warmness, the kindness etc. and help people be more happy. \n\nNow you\u2019re really digging into it, you start making videos, writing blogs going out to teach happiness. People are really digging it and you feel like you\u2019re doing good for the world. So the concept is in everyone\u2019s mind happiness is what we should strive for and whoever is not happy enough yet just needs to try harder. Suddenly you\u2019re watching the news and you hear more and more people are getting symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety. And you think to yourself wow how did that happen? I thought I was making   the world a better place. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with a lot of these concepts that once they get institutionalized or gain popularity they somewhat lose their initial intent and can even have a rebounding effect. I mean we can see it going that way with a lot of different trends like mindfulness, health awareness, the work life balance etc.",
