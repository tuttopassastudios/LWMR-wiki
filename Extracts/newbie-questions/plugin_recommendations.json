    "content": "Haha just relaying my experience. If you're sending to a mastering engineer it's a whole different conversation.\n\nAlways think about what you're trying to accomplish at any given stage. Then go after that goal. \n\nI used to spend too much time on sonics in writing sessions. I should have been solely focused on finding emotional magic. Now  I am just trying to inspire the artists and writers around me, I'll deal with the sonics later. Much better results.\n\nI also used to fully mix-as-I-go, which painted me into a corner with gain staging and eq. Now when I get to the end of the process, I often pull things back and rebuild my levels so there's headroom and I can make that exciting production translate.\n\nDifferent approaches for different parts of the process.",

    "content": "I would rule out the Izotope production bundle (Ozone is fine). I think Izotope is the least musical and hit-or-miss of the options. It's not bad, but it's not as fun to use as the other options, and I think that has an effect on your results.\n\nBoth the FabFilter Mastering bundle and Soundtoys bundle are great and you wouldn't go wrong with either pick. But they occupy different niches: FabFilter is clean and surgical while Soundtoys is all about injecting vibe and coloration and doesn't include anything remotely surgical.\n\nI guess if you can only pick one I'd start with Soundtoys for the vibe and the way it would expand the sonic palette for your production work. Your DAW is going to have some perfectly capable EQ's and compressors to tide you over until you're ready for FabFilter.\n\nPut another way, your production work is upstream of your mixing work and will influence the sound of your records more.",

    "content": "Nailed it Will. Split mono is a step in my mix prep sequence. Efficient method goes like this:\n\nPT Downmixer stock plugin is the one for this (it collapses stereo channels to mono) - flip the phase of one side in the GUI and save that as your user default. If you insert your Downmixer on a faux stereo track, it\u2019ll immediately silence it, so you can happily split and delete what you don\u2019t need. \n\n(Check the meters though, sometimes ambience or other subtle stereo info isn\u2019t very audible unless cranked.)\n\nIf the stereo track contains slightly panned mono information, pushing/pulling either of the faders in Downmixer will quickly get it to cancel, and you can note how much extra gain you need to add or subtract when level matching in the final step (below). Obviously if it\u2019s deliberately panned info, you can either just leave the track stereo or match the pan position by ear (I prefer to do this because I like mono channels to behave like mono channels, and also half the CPU you\u2019d use on a stereo track).\n\nFinally, use clip gain to add 3dB to the resulting mono channel, and obviously pan it centre. This makes up for the level change according to default pan laws in Tools (-3dB).",

Everything on headphones is going to sound clear and direct, when that may not be the case coming through speakers. Checking stuff on some decent monitors in a decent room -- or even in your car --  is always the best way to know if things sound off or not. If you're stuck with headphones, something open back like a Sennheiser 600 will give you a less-hyped, more honest picture of your mix. They're also much less fatiguing to work on for long periods of time! But even to this day with my nice setup, I'm always checking the low end in different places... In my car, I'll know within 10 seconds of listening if things are where they're supposed to be or not.",

    "content": "Any basic digital multimeter that you can get at Harbor Freight, Home Depot etc will do the trick! If you generate tones (sin waves) in your DAW or with an external device you can measure AC voltages at the various points you are interested in, and calibrate if need be. It\u2019s important to understand what various decibel levels translate to in voltage, as that is what you would be measuring. For example, +4dBu = 1.228 Volts, and -10dBV = 0.316 Volts. But like the other answer said, unless you need to calibrate your outputs for a specific reason, you will be fine connecting various pieces of pro-audio gear as long as you pay attention to the gain staging and adjust gain as necessary so there\u2019s no clipping. And if you need to interface with a consumer level device you\u2019d probably be better off getting a bump-box or something of the like.",

In this case, while I'd focus my attention on getting some reps in on various mixing projects, there's certainly room to grow in your equipment stable. Headphones are a great starting point and will likely continue to be useful down the road, but mixing on speakers helps you make things translate better to the real world (car & home stereos, public spaces, etc). So a pair of decent entry level monitors would be my next purchase. It will also prove useful for collaborating with other folks down the road as you can all hear the same thing from the same source.",

Just like with the record side, there's so much noise from bedroom composers and people that have zero real-world experience.

Maybe I'm a bit cranky after an 8 hour delay at the airport yesterday, but Spitfire has gotten quite good at creating \"tutorial\" videos that are thinly veiled advertisements, and many of their libraries are the equivalent of one-knob plugins or CLA vocals. Selling paint-by-numbers solutions to na\u00efve kids who want to get into scoring (They're far from the only ones guilty of this). But to focus on some of the channels I think are actually worth their salt:\n\n8-Bit Music Theory: https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory/videos\nCan be a bit basic at times, but he talks a lot about structure which, IMO, is becoming a lost art in modern scoring.\n\nAnne-Kathrin Dern: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJg1w7F3PKPbSpEF2YOejVjWAg-KcM3Z\nNot the biggest name out there, but she has a no-bullshit way of explaining things about orchestration and theory that is clear and concise. As far as \"teachers,\" I think she's a good one.\n\nAlan Meyerson Waves Sessions: https://youtu.be/h9jZqn5lnw4\nI hesitate to include this. I know for a fact that Alan swapped out a bunch of his go-to plugins to make everything a Waves product. I haven't watched this in awhile, but it's a good insight into how he sets up a big mix session and why he makes some of his decisions. He's also playing to the camera/audience some, so this is a your-mileage-may-vary recommendation.\n\nMcGowen Soundworks: https://www.youtube.com/@McGowanSoundworks/featured\nPhil knows his shit, and goes pretty deep breaking down a few actual mixes, which is pretty rare to find.\n\nIf I think of others, I'll report back.

I do not find the M50s or the 770s even close to \"well balanced\", they both are a bit too budget for that distinction(they both have extreme presence peaks at their respective frequencies). I know someone who is very happy with the Shure SRH940s and Shure 1840s for critical listening(same drivers, I think). The M50s and 770s are both pretty much unusable in the low end under 50-60hz for me, I don't feel they translate well there. A few mastering engineers use the Blue closed-back headphones as a low-end reference, they would probably be worth a try. Audeze stuff is pretty good for transient response, but more expensive.",

One is out of commission so I\u2019m using genelec 1032a\u2019s with sonarworks. I started working on genelecs when I got my new job, and genuinely my mixes translated 100% more on those and they\u2019re not even the best monitors. Sonarworks takes out the chunky low mid thing and adds more high end and low end which I like. It depends on the room/setup too. I think you can\u2019t go wrong with any upgrade from the Yamahas. I wouldn\u2019t buy genelec 1032s, they\u2019re just what my studio has.",

Use the SRC in iZotope RX on it\u2019s stock preset to 44.1 and you are in pretty good shape\n- **Digital EQs work better at higher sample rates because of cramping.** Cramping was an esoteric problem with older digital EQs that looked bad on analyzers but never actually sounded very bad. It\u2019s a solved problem nowadays with most EQs.\n- **Video and film is at 48k so we must start there.** Yes film and TV still work at 48k (although YouTube specs 44.1 now) but I have sent a million tracks for sync at 44.1 and it gets dropped in with SRC and away we go",

    "content": "This has been on my mind lately, so I just figured I should run it across: I was being mentored (mixing) by this guy who I respect tremendously. He was always telling me that I need to replace my plugins (have been using free plugins for the longest) and suggested that I start with Waves and some of the UAD offerings. So, I went ahead and downloaded all the Waves counterparts (UAD wouldn't work on my computer for some reason) to my stable of free plugins and did a mix that way. At first I really liked it, but then the sound of the Waves stuff began to wear on me for some reason. That's the only way I can describe it - The sound started to wear on me. So, now I'm back to using my free plugins and liking mixing again. All that to say: Is there any reason I shouldn't use free plugins?? I have zero knowledge of what's going on \"under the hood\" of all this stuff. Zero technological prowess in that regard whatsoever. The only way i know how to tell if something is \"better\" than the other is by feeling, I suppose. So, yeah. And all these paid plugins, I mean... it's a lot of money. Thanks, ya'll.",
