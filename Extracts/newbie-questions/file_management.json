Go fuck it mode. You need to have a ton of contacts. Take a lot of shots. Of course I have no idea about what you are doing currently...but zero people I've ever talked to in this situation have taken enough shots. \"I reached out to 5 people this week\"...no. HUNDREDS. Most people will ignore you. But just keep going. Watch a Goggins video before you start or something haha\n\nReally think about the experience of working with you. Is it amazing? Is it easy? Is your communication, care, intention incredible? Even things like how files are named/delivered/etc matters. You can only be as good as you are at mixing until you get more reps. But you can control how you interact and the professionalism and confidence you can inspire on the other side.\n\nIf someone lets you mix a song...are they coming back? They need to if you are going to have a business doing this!\n\nSorry to be prescriptive here...but I've seen this question asked of me enough to know that it's so so hugely about just brutal persistence in many aspects, assuming you have talent, etc to do the actual thing.",

It finally clicked that many folks these days (especially in the pop world) are getting stems to mix from \u2014 not full multitrack sessions \u2014 and often not real drumsets/instruments in real rooms. In my world, for better or worse, I\u2019m almost always getting multitrack files. So the prospect of only spending 2-3 hours on a mix is just impossible. That will often times barely get me past the drum sound! So for us mere mortals that are still stuck mixing real instruments, here\u2019s my process for approaching drum mixing.",

    "content": "I think a few things can factor in... sometimes there are contracts, maybe you need your lawyer to read it or at a minimum spend time to go over it yourself. Negotiation could be more intense, deliverables could be more scrutinized and annoying. Often deadlines are tighter/more strict.  Dealing with them dictating terms of payment IE when/how you get paid, as opposed to indie gigs where you can set your own payment terms and most people will be happy to follow them. And for me personally, the label gigs ive had (not a ton but a few at least), i ask for more because I know the budget generally will be higher than most of my local indie clients. And TBH it feels more like what im worth, than what i normally get paid by local artists without label support.  Thats partially because i probably dont ask for enough for my indie gigs, and partially just my location/client base.\n\nTBH  I also dont have a problem morally with asking a corporation to pay me more for a service than an individual that is paying out of pocket... partially for the reasons listed and partially because if they're playing the capitalism game, why cant i when im working with them? Not to the point where i feel im being greedy, but, just advocating for myself a litlte stronger than i normally do.",

It\u2019s not as easy as lining a kick to the grid as half you guys are using kick samples that have space before the transient.  When I\u2019m out here nudging and stretching vocals at 1/1000th of second resolutions, which can dramatically change the pocket and vibe, it\u2019s a kick in the teeth then if the whole track ends up being a tenth of a second off. \n\nThe trick I came up with was putting four low frequency Square wave bursts maybe an 1/8th note long each at the beginning or end of each song. That means at no matter the master bus processing (or worse the mp3 meta data at the beginning pushing the song back) you can recalibrate EXACTLY the track back on to the grid. In that case, once you\u2019ve figured that bit out, slap whatever you want on the bus. The square wave trick is how we were able to prove how logic or ableton was bouncing out of time even when a ton of people didn\u2019t hear it or notice.",

I ask them to send me the session too as I have Pro Tools, Logic, and Ableton and can play with their processing and do a new bounce if need be.\n\nIf a vocal bounce comes back with some delay uncompensated or otherwise off the grid, lining up the vocal will NOT take you an hour. You simply line up the ref to your session and the vocal to the ref (the latter is 99% of time already done since they're bouncing from the same session). This takes a few minutes max and I've done it dozens of times. Nudge and flip some phase and you're within a couple samples. You're fine.",

    "content": "I started getting serious about recording while I was in college (studying chemistry). I was playing bass in a band at the time and I was the only one that had any sort of decent recording equipment. I found myself being the guy recording all of the band's demos before we went into a 'proper studio'. Eventually, we realized my demos were sounding better than the ones we paid other people to record! Meanwhile, I started assisting (for free) at a local small recording studio and met a really great mentor. The studio was small and its business was mostly weekend warrior type stuff \u2013 nobody really notable. That being said, it was a working studio \u2013 and booked almost 6-7 days a week. The producer was the big fish in the small pond and had a great repeat clientele. Most of the music was not my cup of tea \u2013 but this proved to be a good thing as I was exposed to all sorts of different styles and it allowed me to be comfortable in genres of music which I normally wouldn't gravitate towards. It just made me comfortable around music and musicians in general.\n\nOnce I graduated and decided I wasn't going to use my chemistry degree, I ended up helping the producer build a bigger studio complex from the ground up. I learned an insane amount of stuff during this period \u2013 whether it was researching which Pro Tools system we would need to helping design the wiring layout to actually implementing it all. Ultimately, after months of hard work (and lots of borrowed money) the studio was complete and it was ready for business. I worked here for 2 years or so until I got introduced to Eric Valentine through former Street To Nowhere guitarist Matt Radosevich in Los Angeles. He needed a new full-time assistant and so I hopped at the opportunity and moved to LA \u2013 leaving behind the studio and crew I helped build (they're still going today and they're doing great).",

    "content": "My advice here - I have not seen the issue I mentioned today if I'm batching out groups of stems.  For example - if I print a group of stems on THE SAME RENDER then they tend to sum with each other correctly/sample accurately.  It seems in my case to be if I'm printing stems one at a time, then one print may sometimes be offset 1 sample.  So if you are printing multitrack drums, try and print them together, or at the very least, load them into another DAW or a clean session and make sure they are adding back up like you expected ESPECIALLY for parallel processing.\n\nThe main takeaway here should be if you are sending files to another person to work on them you should always check your work so what goes out is what you expected to have go out!",

    "content": "From my side -- this gets down to \"what is mastering even for?\" territory -- but to the question at hand, it completely depends. As it must. Every project and song is different. Even on the same project, from the same mixer, it can vary widely. Mixers differ in how they deliver as well.\n\nMy opinon is mixers should take the song as far as they can, get it as close to finished as possible, this is better for the music to me. Don't even think about mastering. Then any great ME can add more x/y/z as they hear it (not always level, mastering is also about restraint). \n\nIf you can be concerned with making the music the most itself and singular as possible, really listening for the song, you are doing the right thing. Maybe it needs to be loud, maybe not. Often it seems to me there is a misplaced focus on continuity, or a comparison to a reference, which leads me to ask...are we listening for the music anymore? Or some target that is not what we've actually made?\n\nJust listen for what's there, and do absolutely everything you know how to do to help that. Any competent ME can take it from there, however you prefer to deliver",

I can push the clip gain in the video software all the way up and not clip before I bring it into protools for final limiting. I still end up around -20 LUFS before limiting which means I need about 6 LUFS to bring it to YouTube 's -14 standard. So my question is what strategies with gain staging etc would you recommend so that im not having the limiter clamp too much when I go to do final export?",

Note - there is also a settting in pro tools to \"always use 32-bit for audiosuite processing\" for this reason!

So it feels like the next best thing would be finding good vocal producers in the local area. But what if the budget is tight and that is not possible either? I definitely do think teaching artists how to record themselves is going to be beneficial and that wouldn\u2019t be difficult. The problem is in vocal delivery and just getting the vibe of the whole music right. On my end, it\u2019s definitely possible to do live streams and have the artist give me active feedback. But it doesn\u2019t work the other way around, nor it\u2019s not gonna be easy to quickly record vocal ideas while doing this either. The real time magic of collaboration would face technical obstacles in remote settings. So I wondered if anyone has found some kind of solution to this.",

    "content": "I definitely experienced this on my M1 Macbook - some explanation I saw seemed to make sense to me where the power saving/efficiency settings adjust the clock speed of the cpu cores to meet the demand/load.  I think similar features are implemented in Intel systems depending on how you have your power settings set in the BIOS and OS (at least in Windows).  So counterintuitively if you aren't pushing your cores to the limit they won't be operating as effectively.  When I'm working on the Mac I keep the buffer as low as possible and then tick it up during the mix process, and on Windows my machine is usually really stable at 1024 from start to finish in a mix so I just leave it there, but I've also disabled any sort of power saving stuff on my PC in the BIOS so the clock speeds should be relatively stable.  Again, I'm not sure if this is actually the cause or not but just what I've seen posted about online anecdotally!",

What worries me is that some of the files that I didnt touch also don't align. I've exported them referencing the range of the instrumental track and ive also exported them using \"entire length\" as a reference. It always seems to happen.

When people get there, I then play just the drums, or whatever, and we start layering other stuff on top of them. I speed it up, slow it down, use various parts, cut and paste - basically just to get something that inspires me during composition. Later, I'll come back with real musicians and actually record it, but this is a pretty powerful demo creation method, for me at least.

They're probably  not coming for outlets. A handyman will be your best bet to offload the work practically if you don't want to do it yourself. Like I said in deleted comments, if you going to do it yourself. Get the electricty detector pen. And check each outlet before starting. Even after turning off the breaker. Just cause the first 4 are off. The fifth might be on the washer and dryer breaker line a floor above. The electricity wont kill ya, but it will zoom ya. Also if renting landlord should be consulted first to see if theyll carry the weight of the task. Considering the state of the 30 plus year old outlets, probably unlikely. Your above question about protect you not the gear, I don't understand that framing? I used the AI to try and save myself from typing this..... alas",

It's extremely focused and his messaging is crystal clear.\n\nFYI, that excerpt is from an internal document for his business that was made public. It's all about orienting his staff towards how they do things, and what they are here to do. To get everyone aligned on the mission. It's a pretty remarkable act of leadership; whether you like Mr. Beast or not.",

Tried searching a lot about this by looking at \"headphone rec\" and \"hrtf\" but I'm getting even more confused, just craving a stable monitoring system for me. Hope this is not too newbie of a question.\n\nI\u2019m an intermediate mix engineer \u2014 normally mix on Yamaha HS8s but I\u2019ve been travelling a lot lately, and I\u2019m craving a stable monitoring solution I can rely on while on the road. I actually love how the ATH-M50x sound, but they\u2019re not giving me the translation I need for mixing. I tried Beyer DT-990 and disliked the sound. Thinking about getting Sennheiser HD650 \u2014 should I pair it with a headphone amp even though I already have an Apollo Twin? HD650 + amp might be pricey, or would AirPods Max 2 be a reasonable travel/monitoring/critical mixing alternative? Clients send notes that confuse me with the M50x (rare on the HS8s) \u2014 it\u2019s only ~10% of the time but I want that gone. Any recommendations?",
