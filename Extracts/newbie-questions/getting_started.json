    "content": "Agreed -- be critical of everything. Be critical of things that are expensive for the sake of being expensive. Things that are just  instagram ads shilling to newbies. Critical of  Greg Wells pandering to whatever his base is. But recommending a 4k converter based on 'audible conversion quality' isn't helpful if the consumer doesn't have a million other ducks in a row first -- room treatment, adequate monitoring, proper gainstaging, etc. Jon has that figured out, so it makes sense for him. But when people come into a forum with questionable knowledge and background in music production asking what's the best converter, I think it's fair to ask some prying questions before just making blanket recommendations on what one person heard or not. I have plenty of semi-OK stuff that still gets used on the regular, and plenty of expensive gear that I would happily toss out of my workflow. They're all just tools. And whether its bougie DW Fearn or a black-friday Acustica plugin, , if it works for your workflow and gets you results you're happy with, then its worth whatever money you're willing to pay for it.",

That way you can really understand the idea of a threshold, different attack/release combinations, and and compression ratios. Once you can start to understand what you're hearing, then you can apply that to other compressors that might have more fixed variables (LA2a, etc). I've always found overdoing it when you're first getting the settings will help you understand whats going on.",

I only have 2 real \u201cclients\u201d right now but I\u2019m mixing, producing, writing, recording\u2026 I love it, don\u2019t get me wrong. The more I can help, the better. I guess I\u2019m just having trouble navigating this space. Going deep with these 2 artists, I\u2019m having a hard time building a portfolio, which is messing with my confidence. Specially with mixing. I can get thumbs up from the people I\u2019m working with, my mentor (my old engineer), but without audience interaction I don\u2019t know what to do with that. I\u2019d like to take on more work, but I only have 1 mix out. Hopefully an EP a couple more mixes by the end of next month. I feel weird shopping myself with no portfolio, free work or not. I don\u2019t know where I stand, where to focus my energy and everything just feels like it\u2019s on slow-drip. Any advice?",

But in my opinion, how beautiful of a place would this be if we could ask the questions we actually want, if i am asking ruairi a question about eq, its not because my intention is to waste his time, its because i want to learn from him, i look upto him and i respect him, if he doesn\u2019t have the \u201ctime\u201d, maybe someone else will, but saying \u201cask better questions\u201d thats for sure very rude, especially to a newbie (this is the newbie chat) I genuinely think this is one of the most important audio communities on the internet.

Sorry if this is long, I\u2019m bad at short form.\n\nContext: I have been producing music in sincerity for maybe 3 years now, been a hobby since like 16. I\u2019ve started to engineer out of necessity for my individual artistry, but one thing led to the next and I gained a fair bit of skill at it (or so I\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m still pretty insecure, honestly even being around all the really knowledge people on here makes my panic disorder go \ud83d\udcc8). I\u2019ve gotten an internship at a studio as a runner and a session assistant down here (it\u2019s not paid but it\u2019s not exactly unpaid), and I truly have learned a lot (I learn something new on the daily I swear), but I\u2019ve yet to have any true guidance from an established figure yet (which very well may never happen), which I know isn\u2019t necessary, but it absolutely makes me question my own abilities/career decisions despite what happens with my freelance work and I\u2019m curious to know if this is like normal/how other people cope. \n\nLike, I\u2019ve gotten a somewhat okay share of people who pay for my work as an engineer/producer/writer, but the \u201cdo you really know what you\u2019re doing\u201d doubt doesn\u2019t fade easily\u2014even when I\u2019ve been paid by people on like label level budgets, I\u2019m never really registering that success. I\u2019ve had cool moments and landed spotify placements as a mixer for artists, and there\u2019s this part of me that\u2019s still somewhat ashamed that I do a lot more work for free than I care to admit. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the comments on the old episodes that has me spooked (Jon on #61 re: \u201cnot everyone can be a mixer\u201d), but is this like just me or do even some of the really wicked smart people here still feel that\u2014and if so, how do you guys handle the it?",

I have a question about recording guitars: I have a bunch of songs that fluctuate a lot dynamically. Live, I use three or four clean boosts to drive my amp into different levels of distortion (jcm 800). The last time I did a record, I just did it as though i was playing live - just hitting the boosts along with the click when the song went into the different sections. It worked fine, but I've had many working engineers tell me that's NOT the way to do it. Rather, I should have recorded each section that has a different level of distortion/ intensity on its own, so that way I can have more control over the mix and end up with cleaner transitions, potentially... I'm just curious how people here may have handled such a thing. Not that it's important, probably, but I'll add that I don't use any volume or tone controls on my guitars - just humbucker straight to jack. I control all the dynamics with my pedals and strumming hand. Thanks.",

They honestly don't sound bad to me, but i was wondering if that could be a reason why i just never got them to fit well in the mix - crappy spdif or something just not gelling well.

    "content": "Hey guys! Heard a lot about this community. Sorry for the ChatGPT post but English is not my native language. Tried searching a lot about this by looking at \"headphone rec\" and \"hrtf\" but I'm getting even more confused, just craving a stable monitoring system for me. Hope this is not too newbie of a question.\n\nI\u2019m an intermediate mix engineer \u2014 normally mix on Yamaha HS8s but I\u2019ve been travelling a lot lately, and I\u2019m craving a stable monitoring solution I can rely on while on the road. I actually love how the ATH-M50x sound, but they\u2019re not giving me the translation I need for mixing. I tried Beyer DT-990 and disliked the sound. Thinking about getting Sennheiser HD650 \u2014 should I pair it with a headphone amp even though I already have an Apollo Twin? HD650 + amp might be pricey, or would AirPods Max 2 be a reasonable travel/monitoring/critical mixing alternative? Clients send notes that confuse me with the M50x (rare on the HS8s) \u2014 it\u2019s only ~10% of the time but I want that gone. Any recommendations?",

(not literally asking because everyone does digital archival, but just thinking out loud)",
