    "content": "Agreed -- be critical of everything. Be critical of things that are expensive for the sake of being expensive. Things that are just  instagram ads shilling to newbies. Critical of  Greg Wells pandering to whatever his base is. But recommending a 4k converter based on 'audible conversion quality' isn't helpful if the consumer doesn't have a million other ducks in a row first -- room treatment, adequate monitoring, proper gainstaging, etc. Jon has that figured out, so it makes sense for him. But when people come into a forum with questionable knowledge and background in music production asking what's the best converter, I think it's fair to ask some prying questions before just making blanket recommendations on what one person heard or not. I have plenty of semi-OK stuff that still gets used on the regular, and plenty of expensive gear that I would happily toss out of my workflow. They're all just tools. And whether its bougie DW Fearn or a black-friday Acustica plugin, , if it works for your workflow and gets you results you're happy with, then its worth whatever money you're willing to pay for it.",

    "content": "i love this question. i've been doing this for long enough that the cycles of how records sound has changed several times. so every few years i try and take some time to unlearn/relearn.\n\nthere's no good short answer, but i'd start with taking some time outside of mixing to just listen to records. whether you've done this before or not, get to know your speakers and your monitoring environment better than before. listen to your favorite records that you know well, and make some tweaks. you don't necessarily have to redo your whole setup, but listen to your speakers in slightly different positions, different settings on the back of the speaker, etc. and really dig into listening and enjoy yourself.\n\nthat's usually enough to make me think about mixes very differently (which ultimately means i get better when i re-incorporate most of the things i already know). but if you need more, just try and simplify. start a mixing by just leveling everything. clip gain and leveling and panning. then balance frequencies and compress (via compressor or saturator or limiter or whatever). basically, with fresh ears, go back to basics.\n\nnot sure if that will transform you into a new mixer, but that's an outline of an approach i use when i feel like i need a big talent upgrade",

If all I\u2019m doing is recording, I want to be writing. I\u2019m happiest when my weeks have a bit of everything. \n\nIncidentally though, songwriting has been a surprising source of mix work - would recommend.

    "content": "3) Not all manufacturers are created equal. With vinyl pressing plants months behind on their bookings, there are many budget plants that seem to be doing things for cheaper and quicker. You get what you pay for. QRP in Kansas are the best in the business. RTI in CA used to be the gold standard, but they dogged me real hard on a project about 10 years ago and never made things right. Even Doug Sax had to step in to set them straight.\n\nThe short of it is, if someone is venturing down the path of manufacturing vinyl for their project \u2014 *especially* if it\u2019s self funded \u2014 they have to ask what they\u2019re really looking to achieve. If they want a high-quality, analog preservation of their record for all to enjoy, then they need to be prepared to spend some real coin to achieve good results. If they just want a physical item to sell at shows and toss in a download code \u2014 that\u2019s OK too \u2014 but it will still be pricey, and probably won\u2019t sound great if you do it on the cheap.

It sounds like you're in a position where people may not be giving you the time of day. At this point what a potential mentor figure will be seeking from you is an assurance that you are committed to the path and that their effort will not be wasted on someone who is not committed. \n\nConsidering your position, right now I would recommend adopting an attitude of A) respectful persistence when asking others for insight and help B) private study and a self-starting attitude to make things happen for yourself without their assistance C) actively seeking opportunities to assist, contribute, and be of help to others and D) building your own network of creative collaborators with whom you can continue to create and experiment together.",

There are a lot of reasons that an Apollo might be a good investment, but buying them for the converters probably isn't the best use of your money at this stage.\n\nThe difference that converters will make (if any) is very very small compared to other factors. Factors like having a good room to listen in, acoustic treatment for the room, and the monitors you're listening through. I would prioritize those and consider converters to be very low priority until you get those other factors working well.\n\nSo unless there are other reasons that you'd like to have an Apollo I think you can save your money for the time being.",

    "content": "Are you looking for resources on writing/production, or mixing? Just like with the record side, there's so much noise from bedroom composers and people that have zero real-world experience. And as Ruairi is always saying, even the people with real success often can't teach what they know. Maybe I'm a bit cranky after an 8 hour delay at the airport yesterday, but Spitfire has gotten quite good at creating \"tutorial\" videos that are thinly veiled advertisements, and many of their libraries are the equivalent of one-knob plugins or CLA vocals. Selling paint-by-numbers solutions to na\u00efve kids who want to get into scoring (They're far from the only ones guilty of this). But to focus on some of the channels I think are actually worth their salt:\n\n8-Bit Music Theory: https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory/videos\nCan be a bit basic at times, but he talks a lot about structure which, IMO, is becoming a lost art in modern scoring.\n\nAnne-Kathrin Dern: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJg1w7F3PKPbSpEF2YOejVjWAg-KcM3Z\nNot the biggest name out there, but she has a no-bullshit way of explaining things about orchestration and theory that is clear and concise. As far as \"teachers,\" I think she's a good one.\n\nAlan Meyerson Waves Sessions: https://youtu.be/h9jZqn5lnw4\nI hesitate to include this. I know for a fact that Alan swapped out a bunch of his go-to plugins to make everything a Waves product. I haven't watched this in awhile, but it's a good insight into how he sets up a big mix session and why he makes some of his decisions. He's also playing to the camera/audience some, so this is a your-mileage-may-vary recommendation.\n\nMcGowen Soundworks: https://www.youtube.com/@McGowanSoundworks/featured\nPhil knows his shit, and goes pretty deep breaking down a few actual mixes, which is pretty rare to find.\n\nIf I think of others, I'll report back. Hope that helps",

My additional complicating factor is having a laptop that is a dupe of the studio rig, so keeping it all straight and everything in sync is a bit of a puzzle. \n\nI took the transition as the opportunity to phase out some mechanical drives so I had to get some new drives for the M4 instead of re-using the old Time Machine mechanical drive. The M4 mini only has Thunderbolt/USB C ports -- the M1 has USB A's and Thunderbolt/USB C's so I needed a TB hub to get my old USB hub to play on the M4. The move forced me to sort out my iLok strategy between my mastering rig and my production rig because it was quite messy (I ended up getting a 2nd iLok for the M4 to make things way easier between it and the laptop). It was just a lot of little stuff for me. If you're not changing machine form factors and it's mostly a software exercise, then it might be worth it.",

So for those who have been using tape for a long while or did back in the day, you can't just use any old reel after baking it for a project? or can you say, bake it, use it for the project (record 2 track mix to tape, etc) and then just store it and re-bake it and use it again for the next project? \n\nI didn't grow up with tape but I love the sound and find the whole process romantic, despite how much extra work calibrating tape machines and maintaining them and the unpredictable nature of tape.",

Prob is even when the tracks are not clipping in levels but they all sound like there\u2019s some small level of clipping going to the AD converters .  And I doubt the vocalists has decent microphone techniques singing in. Seeing that the vocals are supposed to sound kinda warm n not as polished , Even with some EQ moves, the vocals are still sounding like there\u2019s some 3rd harmonic sounding saturation on them.  Anyone experienced this before ? Would love to hear anything that\u2019ll help it sound better . \ud83d\ude05",

    "content": "If it\u2019s the hissing kind of noise that you get more of when you switch from condensers to dynamics and ribbons, then it\u2019s not the kind of noise that is coming from the room. \n\nIn rooms the main things you would be concerned about would be reflection (which you fix with treatment) and mechanical noise from things like computer fans, clocks, etc. and condenser mics would pick those kinds of sounds up more, not less. \n\nAny unison pre in the Apollo should be plenty low noise to not bother you on your condenser mics. I agree with others that not using any unison pre will make the noise floor lower, but I disagree with them in that I think using the unison pres is a pretty good idea often. \n\nThat said, if you\u2019re struggling with noise, definitely try not compressing on the way in because compressors are only going to raise the noise floor. \n\nOn dynamic mics and ribbon mics, you can decrease your noise floor pretty considerably by picking up a cloudlifter and throwing that in the chain. \n\nIf you do all of the above and still have a high noise floor then either the Apollo is broken (which is pretty unlikely), or your microphone is picking up mechanical noise from your air conditioning, computer fan, refrigerator, etc. if those are the issue, then tackle the issue there. Turn off the A/C, turn off the fridge, turn off the LED lights, etc and see what you hear.",

I'm sending from output 3 on the evo 8, via a xlr cable (w/ trs adaptor attached at the audient output side), into the input of a WA273.\n\nI am then coming out of the 273 into input 4 of the Evo 8. Using abletons external audio effect device & always am getting signal on output 3, but never any back on input 4. I know that the units are communicating, as if I crank all the input gain up on evo 8, & output on 273, it affects the white noise being sent through both.\n\nI've tried all different cables etc to make sure it's working, but it's always the same each time. Any thoughts? It could also be a evo 8 mixer thing which i'm inspecting now, still haven't gotten used to the software.\n\nApologies if the message is a little convoluted, my brain is being melted by this.

In my case I am set up with BMI in the US as my PRO and Publisher and have an admin pub deal with Sentric to collect in territories outside the US.\n\nAlso you'll want to be set up with SoundExchange to collect digital performance royalties (SiriusXM, iHeart, Pandora).  This often also involves the letter of direction that is kicked off with your producer agreement.\n\nI'm probably forgetting something but I'd highly recommend talking with a music lawyer to get things set up and working for you.",

In fact I think I'm in the best season of my life so far and it feels like everything is going right (aside: aren't you more likely to self sabotage when things are good than when they are bad?) to zoom out a little bit, i already know the answer. I'm doing too much at once, spreading myself thin beyond enjoyment. in the grit of a transition and it's clear where I'm going but I have no frame of reference for the timeline. A few years ago, I was mid-20s, in a band on a major, had roommates & cheap rent, and a chess app addiction. i was still a \"professional\" but things were extremely simple. in short, left the band, spent a few years mixing much more than producing, and now am swinging back that way. I'm about to turn 30, I have a mortgage, a (semi) dependent, my first real studio, an intern to set an example for, 5ish mixing clients at any moment, producing for 3 artists and co-prod/consulting on 2 other projects, playing occasionally in any of 4 different bands, and producing/recording some live performances (as well as starting a YT channel in this lane). In my experience at least, it really seems like something shifted at the top of this year, and I hate to say it but part of the fault is TikTok (is the rest of the fault mine?). Everything is urgent to everyone and nothing informs each other or oscillates together. It feels like a clock is constantly going \"tick, tock, tick, tock\" and the anxiety I once had over money is shifted completely towards my time management. Every time I look away from my phone I have 30 new texts. I think I'm crushing it in my professional demands but I don't know that I'm being the person I want to be for my friends, family and partner. I don't know that I'm setting a good example to this intern. I don't know that I'm there to take care of myself all the way.",

    "content": "Hey guys! Heard a lot about this community. Sorry for the ChatGPT post but English is not my native language. Tried searching a lot about this by looking at \"headphone rec\" and \"hrtf\" but I'm getting even more confused, just craving a stable monitoring system for me. Hope this is not too newbie of a question.\n\nI\u2019m an intermediate mix engineer \u2014 normally mix on Yamaha HS8s but I\u2019ve been travelling a lot lately, and I\u2019m craving a stable monitoring solution I can rely on while on the road. I actually love how the ATH-M50x sound, but they\u2019re not giving me the translation I need for mixing. I tried Beyer DT-990 and disliked the sound. Thinking about getting Sennheiser HD650 \u2014 should I pair it with a headphone amp even though I already have an Apollo Twin? HD650 + amp might be pricey, or would AirPods Max 2 be a reasonable travel/monitoring/critical mixing alternative? Clients send notes that confuse me with the M50x (rare on the HS8s) \u2014 it\u2019s only ~10% of the time but I want that gone. Any recommendations?",

AirPods sound better than the Senheiser HD 650/660, you think? I've gotten really used to M50x will the upgrade be weird to my ears haha?",

Many HDDs all spinning away have a certain amount of noise, but the utility is worthwhile.

As for music, this is my first day on Tidal and... I wish I switched sooner. Y'all weren't kidding about the audio quality difference! Not to mention the ethical considerations, and the ability to send a music link that opens to any streaming platform. Appreciate the suggestion!",
