Critical of  Greg Wells pandering to whatever his base is. But recommending a 4k converter based on 'audible conversion quality' isn't helpful if the consumer doesn't have a million other ducks in a row first -- room treatment, adequate monitoring, proper gainstaging, etc. Jon has that figured out, so it makes sense for him. But when people come into a forum with questionable knowledge and background in music production asking what's the best converter, I think it's fair to ask some prying questions before just making blanket recommendations on what one person heard or not. I have plenty of semi-OK stuff that still gets used on the regular, and plenty of expensive gear that I would happily toss out of my workflow. They're all just tools. And whether its bougie DW Fearn or a black-friday Acustica plugin, , if it works for your workflow and gets you results you're happy with, then its worth whatever money you're willing to pay for it.",

There are a lot of reasons that an Apollo might be a good investment, but buying them for the converters probably isn't the best use of your money at this stage.\n\nThe difference that converters will make (if any) is very very small compared to other factors. Factors like having a good room to listen in, acoustic treatment for the room, and the monitors you're listening through. I would prioritize those and consider converters to be very low priority until you get those other factors working well.\n\nSo unless there are other reasons that you'd like to have an Apollo I think you can save your money for the time being.",

I agree with others that not using any unison pre will make the noise floor lower, but I disagree with them in that I think using the unison pres is a pretty good idea often. \n\nThat said, if you\u2019re struggling with noise, definitely try not compressing on the way in because compressors are only going to raise the noise floor. \n\nOn dynamic mics and ribbon mics, you can decrease your noise floor pretty considerably by picking up a cloudlifter and throwing that in the chain. \n\nIf you do all of the above and still have a high noise floor then either the Apollo is broken (which is pretty unlikely), or your microphone is picking up mechanical noise from your air conditioning, computer fan, refrigerator, etc. if those are the issue, then tackle the issue there. Turn off the A/C, turn off the fridge, turn off the LED lights, etc and see what you hear.",

The only real way to hear a phase shift is to be in an anechoic chamber and play a specialized test signal (like a sine wave with timed phase shift pulses to create a slight warble)\n\nI get how on individual tracks if you EQ something, the phase shift can affect how that track interacts with another track when summed, but I often hear that for example, Jon puts a 16k boost then a 27k low pass on the master that creates a phase bump that he likes. Which theoretically shouldn't be audble... Shouldn't it be some other reason like the VT5 saturating a special way?",
