    "content": "A tangent\u2026\n\nI\u2019m lucky to have spent many years in a great studio with lots of great drums & gear\u2026 not to mention being mentored by one of the great engineers of our time. Having this perspective is massively useful in mixing other peoples tracks, because I feel I have a north star of what good drums can sound like if they\u2019re recorded and performed properly. It used to be that my starting point for mixing drums were working with tracks that I had recorded myself\u2026 and most of the above problems were solved before the mix stage. These days, with smaller budgets and time constraints, its very rare that this is a possibility.\n\nI\u2019m including this drum tracking session from a few years ago that I recorded at Barefoot. It was for a project that Matt was producing that never saw the light of day. But we went all out with the drum setup in the big room, through the console, and had a great drummer. This might be useful for some people who have never gotten properly recorded drum tracks\u2026 to get a sense of how good thigns can sound before the \u2018mix\u2019 stage. These are the tracks that were printed into Pro Tools off of the console, and the three busses were prints of the outboard compressor busses we were using while monitoring. It\u2019s unlikely these busses would get used in mixing, but they\u2019re a good reference to what we were listening to in the room while we were tracking. But as you\u2019ll notice, the individual drum blend can stand on it\u2019s own two feet. Hopefully this is useful as well.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

    "content": "Man. 85 percent of the tracks I\u2019d get would require an hour of trying to line up the song PROPERLY to the grid. It\u2019s not as easy as lining a kick to the grid as half you guys are using kick samples that have space before the transient.  When I\u2019m out here nudging and stretching vocals at 1/1000th of second resolutions, which can dramatically change the pocket and vibe, it\u2019s a kick in the teeth then if the whole track ends up being a tenth of a second off. \n\nThe trick I came up with was putting four low frequency Square wave bursts maybe an 1/8th note long each at the beginning or end of each song. That means at no matter the master bus processing (or worse the mp3 meta data at the beginning pushing the song back) you can recalibrate EXACTLY the track back on to the grid. In that case, once you\u2019ve figured that bit out, slap whatever you want on the bus. The square wave trick is how we were able to prove how logic or ableton was bouncing out of time even when a ton of people didn\u2019t hear it or notice.",

Most likely Eric\u2019s Sonor birch kick drum with a Remo Black Dot on it. Almost certainly Vistalite toms\u2026 and this sounds like a Bell Brass snare.\n\n3) Room mics are placed probably 20 feet away, spaced wide, pointed at the kit. Eric would always point the room mics away from the drums with the cardioid null towards the drum kit, but I found I got more direct, punchy sounds with it facing the drums. Chamber mics would\u2019ve been a foot apart, pointed 45 degs out\u2026 sort of intentionally phasey to make them wider.\n\n4) Yeah, you\u2019re onto it. The overheads are intentionally wide and close to the cymbals. The mono mic and close mics are doing the heavy lifting with the drums and the L/R OHs are almost just cymbal spot mics with some kit stereo information peppered in.\n\n5) Saturation is a combination of driving the UTA pres, clipping the line input of the console, and trimming things back with the faders. Might\u2019ve been an LA-2a on the snare with no compression, just crapping out the tubes.\n\nSorry wish I woulda taken pictures of this session. Dave Elitch was the drummer and he\u2019s a fucking monster.",

    "content": "I love my dear friend @BatMeckley but I think he's wrong here. Just send the instrumental how it sounds the best, and have them send you a bounced ref along with the vocal. I ask them to send me the session too as I have Pro Tools, Logic, and Ableton and can play with their processing and do a new bounce if need be.\n\nIf a vocal bounce comes back with some delay uncompensated or otherwise off the grid, lining up the vocal will NOT take you an hour. You simply line up the ref to your session and the vocal to the ref (the latter is 99% of time already done since they're bouncing from the same session). This takes a few minutes max and I've done it dozens of times. Nudge and flip some phase and you're within a couple samples. You're fine.",

    "content": "I started getting serious about recording while I was in college (studying chemistry). I was playing bass in a band at the time and I was the only one that had any sort of decent recording equipment. I found myself being the guy recording all of the band's demos before we went into a 'proper studio'. Eventually, we realized my demos were sounding better than the ones we paid other people to record! Meanwhile, I started assisting (for free) at a local small recording studio and met a really great mentor. The studio was small and its business was mostly weekend warrior type stuff \u2013 nobody really notable. That being said, it was a working studio \u2013 and booked almost 6-7 days a week. The producer was the big fish in the small pond and had a great repeat clientele. Most of the music was not my cup of tea \u2013 but this proved to be a good thing as I was exposed to all sorts of different styles and it allowed me to be comfortable in genres of music which I normally wouldn't gravitate towards. It just made me comfortable around music and musicians in general.\n\nOnce I graduated and decided I wasn't going to use my chemistry degree, I ended up helping the producer build a bigger studio complex from the ground up. I learned an insane amount of stuff during this period \u2013 whether it was researching which Pro Tools system we would need to helping design the wiring layout to actually implementing it all. Ultimately, after months of hard work (and lots of borrowed money) the studio was complete and it was ready for business. I worked here for 2 years or so until I got introduced to Eric Valentine through former Street To Nowhere guitarist Matt Radosevich in Los Angeles. He needed a new full-time assistant and so I hopped at the opportunity and moved to LA \u2013 leaving behind the studio and crew I helped build (they're still going today and they're doing great).",

    "content": "EQ is powerful! \n\nAre you making the moves with elements in solo or in the context of the mix? Try out both. Solo is easier to hear what your doing to the thing, but eqing the element in context of the song/mix makes it easier to hear if your killing the vibe. I'd guess most people will encourage in-context EQing for this reason.\n\nThe reaper EQ is likely not the issue. Experiment with all the diff filters and shapes for sure! Best way to learn is to try it out. \n\nAlso, eqing something and then undoing it later because it isnt better happens all the time while im mixing. Its great that you're double checking your moves later and trying to be objective about if its an improvement or not. Also- SOMETIMES its a boost not a cut thats needed. Too much bottom, maybe add some top or mids to balance it out instead of cutting bottom (just an example). See how that feels instead.",

    "content": "Neat question. If you're mixing in two channels (L/R) the headroom should be the same no matter where you pan it (with some caveats which we'll get to). If you have a kick drum panned dead center coming in at -6dB on your digital meter it's going to be coming in at -6 in both the L channel and -6 in the R channel. Each channel has it's own independent headroom that doesn't affect the other (until we add a limiter with linked channels), so let's simplify things a bit and mute the R channel for now:\n\nNow you have your L channel with the kick panned \"center\" and the R channel is muted.  If you were to pan this kick to the hard left it would not affect the volume of the L channel at all. That's because the panning effect is created by subtracting gain from the R channel only. Making the kick sound like it's leaning to the left.\n\nNow there's one big element I've left out so far, and that's *pan law*. Ableton Live has a -3dB pan law. This means that sounds panned to the center are reduced by 3dB. Because if a sound is being played at the same volume by both the L and R channels then their voltage will combine to create a sound that is louder than intended. So all DAWs and mixers compensate for this added loudness by turning down the gain of sounds as they are panned closer to the center (and shared between both speakers).\n\nSince all modern DAWs and mixers have pan laws implemented, what happens when you now pan the kick hard left is that it ends up becoming 3dB louder than it was when it was panned in the center, because it is no longer being turned down by the pan law when it\u2019s centered.",

The first thing that stands out to me is that you're using a soft ratio. You need to crank that ratio up to at *least* a 4:1 ratio, but you might be even better off with an 8:1 or higher ratio. You need a high ratio to get the deeper ducking effect that it seems you're seeking.\n\nUsing a soft ratio will never get you a big duck unless you have the threshold pulled all of the way down.

Like anything else, it\u2019ll take a second to adjust, 2 steps back, 3 steps fwd style.\n\nAnother perk of using melodyne standalone is assigning the trackball buttons for the note tune, cut notes, note length, and the chords for vibrato and note length tools.

I normally just use a generic compressor when sidechaining with a soft ratio, no attack/short release, and pretty low threshold (-18 to -24) and it usually works pretty well. Sometimes however the compressor alone isn't enough to dip the 808 and allow the kick to punch through cleanly. I was going to try using F6 instead, but I can't figure out how to sidechain the kick signal itself into F6 (in Ableton at least). Any tips?",

So this should look really similar to the sidechain settings in the stock compressor.

With the stock Ableton plugins this happens automatically when you engage the sidechain but for 3rd party you have to add it manually.  I don't have F6 but looking up an image of the plugin it looks like the option is in the bottom right (2nd picture).\n\nIf that doesn't work then I'm not sure what's going wrong.",

    "content": "This is a very broad question with many different answers, but I think the easiest way to sum up the concept of \u2018gain staging\u2019 is simply figuring out what level every \u2018device\u2019 is expecting and/or which level is ideal to get the results you want. These \u2018devices\u2019 can be a plugin, a piece of hardware, an A/D/A converter, an auxiliary bus, a mix bus, etc.\n\nIn analog world\u2026 there might be fathomable difference when a compressor or amplifier receives -10dBVU vs +10 dBVU. Accounting for these differences would be considered gain staging \u2014 and you\u2019d be looking for what gets the ideal sound out of your box.\n\nIn digital world\u2026 some plugins may react similarly and others may not care if you\u2019re sending -6dBFS or -0.01dBFS. It\u2019s usually case by case as there are myriad plugins. You also need to consider what level the plugin is sending signal out \u2014 as this will affect how the next plugin processes the audio, or how much headroom it has to work with. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m sending signal out of a compressor plugin into an EQ plugin \u2014 and lets say I\u2019m using the compressor to beef up mean volume of the signal and then I want to EQ some more low end into the signal after the fact. Well, I\u2019m going to be adding gain in the compressor and then the level going into the EQ will be hotter than originally intended. Id want to trim down the output of the compressor (or the input of the EQ) so you have headroom to be able to boost those frequencies without clipping the output of the EQ. In a 32-bit floating mixer like Pro Tools, these issues become less audible as the mixer has higher headroom than its indicating, but you never actually know \u2014 and it\u2019s best to just stick to the parameters that you have control over. If you were to do this same function with an analog compressor and EQ, there would be very noticeable distortion if you didn\u2019t stage the gain properly.",

    "content": "Sometimes gain staging is just managing the signals going to an auxiliary bus or a master fader. If you\u2019ve got everything summing into - say - an aux bus in pro tools, and that aux bus is clipping, then that will be audible distortion going into the next gain stage. It may sound good, it probably doesn\u2019t \u2014 so its something to account for earlier down the chain. If you\u2019re going into a master fader in pro tools, and your signal is over 0dBFS, you can simply turn down the master fader, and it is actually turning down all the signals going to it, not just the output. This is useful because you can then throttle the input to your first plugin in the chain \u2014 say a limiter or maximizer. It\u2019d be a shame to have a fancy clipper on your master bus, only to be clipping the signal in the chain before even getting to it.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a scattershot answer to a scattershot question, but the reality is that everything affects everything in audio. And having your head wrapped around signals levels going in and out of things will help you make faster decisions and help you troubleshoot quickly when things aren\u2019t sounding quite right.",

    "content": "Hey i have some noob questions pertaining to room treatment. I've read a bunch over on gearspace in the forums, read a bunch of ethan winers stuff on his site, and will be occupying a room roughly 14x14x8. I got 16 manville 408 2x4 panels for absorption awhile back and my aim is to treat the room for mixing. I need a space to be able to accurately hear so that i can learn and train my ears. Someone on the unofficial reaper discord recommended you guys. I am gonna get a reference mic and set it all up with REW, adding/ removing /moving panels around and taking measurements and then comparing the results? I'm looking at safe  ' sound batting material for bass traps and clouds etc. This is all i've gathered and i won't be in the space for a few weeks so i thought I'd start to get my ducks in a row. Please any and all recommendations/resources/advice is appreciated.",

I'm not super familiar with the evo, so anyone w/ experience with it i'd appreciate the input. Here's my setup. I'm sending from output 3 on the evo 8, via a xlr cable (w/ trs adaptor attached at the audient output side), into the input of a WA273.\n\nI am then coming out of the 273 into input 4 of the Evo 8. Using abletons external audio effect device & always am getting signal on output 3, but never any back on input 4. I know that the units are communicating, as if I crank all the input gain up on evo 8, & output on 273, it affects the white noise being sent through both.\n\nI've tried all different cables etc to make sure it's working, but it's always the same each time. Any thoughts? It could also be a evo 8 mixer thing which i'm inspecting now, still haven't gotten used to the software.\n\nApologies if the message is a little convoluted, my brain is being melted by this. Appreciate all input! \ud83d\ude42",

Try connecting the output of the Evo 8 ch 3 back into the Evo 8 input 4 without the 273 first and make sure it isn\u2019t a software issue, then check the analog connections one at a time if that works.

I have been trying to do that forever. 2. Slip Edit in Reaper and Cubase 3. Use Stretch Markers in Reaper and nudge around little pockets of sound. Now, I have a TRUE and UNIQUE disdain for Reaper. I think it's unintuitive, I think it's cumbersome, I shudder to think of all the time I spent fiddling around with this Nerd-god of a fucking daw when I could've been soaring along in Cubase or Protools, and I'm honestly so, soo sick of it, but... as I'm sitting here with my Dell Lattiude laptop from 2013 with its 8 gigs of ram, trying to install Pro Tools Intro for the 5th time (wheel spinning for minutes on end and then just spontaneously shutting down), I'm thinking to myself, \"Is there any reason I shouldn't just dig my heels into Reaper and finish up this one album with it??\" There are some things I like about Reaper, and the fact that I now preeeetty much know what I need to in order to finish things out, I mean... I've got some serious technological limitations over here. Pro tools intro took 3 hours to download and I'm not even able to install it on my computer. Reaper runs fine (so does Cubase LE4)...
