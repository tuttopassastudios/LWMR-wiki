I realize it's silly, but I take comfort in staying busy and keeping my 'pirate ship' afloat. I definitely have a bottom line, but I like to work with artists to meet them at what they can afford. It keeps my work portfolio diverse and my toolkit in good working order.",

Go fuck it mode. You need to have a ton of contacts. Take a lot of shots. Of course I have no idea about what you are doing currently...but zero people I've ever talked to in this situation have taken enough shots. \"I reached out to 5 people this week\"...no. HUNDREDS. Most people will ignore you. But just keep going. Watch a Goggins video before you start or something haha\n\nReally think about the experience of working with you. Is it amazing? Is it easy? Is your communication, care, intention incredible? Even things like how files are named/delivered/etc matters. You can only be as good as you are at mixing until you get more reps. But you can control how you interact and the professionalism and confidence you can inspire on the other side.\n\nIf someone lets you mix a song...are they coming back? They need to if you are going to have a business doing this!\n\nSorry to be prescriptive here...but I've seen this question asked of me enough to know that it's so so hugely about just brutal persistence in many aspects, assuming you have talent, etc to do the actual thing.",

Though I don't believe it's constructive to dwell on them.\n\nIt's not unusual to feel inferior when surrounded by people who are more experienced and talented than you. We've all felt this. The thing is this; you are in exactly the right place and will only benefit from engaging with this environment. Being surrounded by so many professionals and people with experience is absolutely a benefit to your development and someday you'll look back at how far you've come and be amazed by how fluent you are.\n\nLet me drive this point home just a little more: When you were young and learning your native language, nobody put you in a room and expected you to learn the language by conversing with a bunch of inexperienced two year-olds who couldn't speak. Instead, you were surrounded by expert speakers and learned through interactions with people who were leagues ahead of you in their ability to speak the language. Learning to speak is not an easy task, but by immersing yourself in a community of experts you are on the path to mastery and in no time you'll reap the benefits of that exposure.",

He's very familiar with the characteristic sound that each frequency zone imparts on a given instrument and has mixed most instruments enough times to know how to achieve a given effect without having to hunt for it.\n\nOn top of that, he's probably thinking an order of magnitude higher than that because he would also understand that if he wants to accentuate a given frequency range in an instrument then he can do that by subtracting that frequency from an adjacent instrument. In this sense, I think he's listening closely to the effect that a cut has on every other instrument in a mix - not just the instrument he's subtracting from.",

What I realized very quickly is that the process is fundamentally the same with people of all levels. You get in a room, you make a plan, and you execute it. However, when you've got a major label backing you, there's many more resources available, enabling you to spend more time (and money) making the record... although in my experience this can be both a blessing and a curse!\n\nI assisted Eric for a few years and eventually started networking with more local Los Angeles artists and was able to mix and produce their stuff out of Eric's studio. He was very cool about letting me use the space when we weren't working on bigger projects. He set a very high standard and made it clear that anything that left our studio had to sound really, really great. After assisting and working on my own stuff for several years, Eric then hired me as his full-time main engineer and now I'm on call to work on him for any of his projects. This has been amazing in so many ways as I get to work on high-level commercial music and apply all of my own sensibilities to the process \u2013 as well as the stuff I've learned from Eric over the years.\n\nObviously my tale is one in a million and there's not a day that goes my where I don't realize how lucky I am. Now that I've worked full time recording music for almost 8 years, I've realized there are certain things you need to have to be successful:",

    "content": "I started getting serious about recording while I was in college (studying chemistry). I was playing bass in a band at the time and I was the only one that had any sort of decent recording equipment. I found myself being the guy recording all of the band's demos before we went into a 'proper studio'. Eventually, we realized my demos were sounding better than the ones we paid other people to record! Meanwhile, I started assisting (for free) at a local small recording studio and met a really great mentor. The studio was small and its business was mostly weekend warrior type stuff \u2013 nobody really notable. That being said, it was a working studio \u2013 and booked almost 6-7 days a week. The producer was the big fish in the small pond and had a great repeat clientele. Most of the music was not my cup of tea \u2013 but this proved to be a good thing as I was exposed to all sorts of different styles and it allowed me to be comfortable in genres of music which I normally wouldn't gravitate towards. It just made me comfortable around music and musicians in general.\n\nOnce I graduated and decided I wasn't going to use my chemistry degree, I ended up helping the producer build a bigger studio complex from the ground up. I learned an insane amount of stuff during this period \u2013 whether it was researching which Pro Tools system we would need to helping design the wiring layout to actually implementing it all. Ultimately, after months of hard work (and lots of borrowed money) the studio was complete and it was ready for business. I worked here for 2 years or so until I got introduced to Eric Valentine through former Street To Nowhere guitarist Matt Radosevich in Los Angeles. He needed a new full-time assistant and so I hopped at the opportunity and moved to LA \u2013 leaving behind the studio and crew I helped build (they're still going today and they're doing great).",

Most of all, the biggest lessons were always about *listening*: Listening to your partners, listening to their intent, and listening to the audience. There is no time to plan.

The worst one vampired an entire croissant tray before the client showed up and took 5 minutes to set up a mic stand w/ a 57 on it. To echo the others- ask how you can be helpful (and double echo the advice to brush up on basics on your own). I recommend keeping a notebook- shit moves fast and you won't remember everything. Keep tabs on fussy gear (especially if multiple producers or engineers are using the space and aren't as familiar with it). Be a cable-wrapping ninja and know how everyone takes their coffee.",

    "content": "Noah covered a lot, but a few (also stream of consciousness) thoughts to add:\n\nThere is no formula to when to take the leap. It's helpful to have some money in the bank, because it's going to take awhile for things to start happening. The more connections you have, the more in-roads you've made, the easier it will be to drum up work in music and keep the lights on. The less responsibilities and overhead you have, the easier the beginning stages of freelance life will be.\n\nDon't think about your music career in terms of the same metrics as your day job, you're burnt out on it for a reason. So instead of \"am I making what I made before,\" think \"can I survive on this for now?\" and if not, \"what will get me to a place that I can afford to pursue this dream?\"\n\nAny music job can be a boon for your career, and chances are you don't know where the opportunities will come from. The Beatles became the Beatles by playing cover songs at shady clubs, honing their sound and learning to play with each other. For someone else, that would've been a mindless, thankless gig with no upside. When they started playing better gigs, they were ready and stood out because of it.\n\nHow you do anything is how you do everything - if you're an intern at a studio cleaning up trash, you may be around huge artists and engineers. If they see you as dependable, friendly, going above-and-beyond, there's a tiny chance that a life-changing opportunity could emerge. Likewise, if they see you doing a sloppy job, that's how they're going to assume you'd be in the room, too.",

Over the last 7 years of engineering in studios of all kinds on a wide variety of projects, I've built up a bunch of recall notes + photos / tips that I picked up, all gathered in Evernote. Some of them will be audible in commerical recordings. I've wanted to formalise them to share in some way for a while, so I'm wondering if the people here can suggest the most useful and accessible way to do that.\n\nIn a perfect world I'd do YouTube videos for them all, but I just don't have time to commit to that. A reasonable tradeoff might be to build out a reference section on my website (what I've been calling... The Cookbook), and leave it there for ever more for people to pilfer from.\n\nWhat say ye?",

Often something like 90ms on one side, 120ms on the other. Feel it out on one side, then add some time to the other.\n\nTry adding some fake distance to your existing room mics with a simple delay with no feedback (there\u2019s a Steve Albini drum video on YouTube where he demonstrates this). You can delay both sides equally, or solo one side, delay it til it feels good/sounds cool, then do the other. Anything from 12ms-around 23 seems to work. From there things start to become more like a slap, but than can be cool too.\n\nSmash up your existing rooms a bit, or a lot. Omnipressor, Devil Loc, UAD Zener, decapitator, Rough Rider (free), Arousor/Distressor in nuke, Lo-Fi. \n\nSend to a gated verb - Cian shared a drum session a while back with a short VintageVerb preset that\u2019s often useful. RMX16 Non-Lins can be good too, although it\u2019s easy to bring things into 80s territory this way.\n\nSend to a short room verb like ocean way, SP2016, Pro-R, Valhalla Room, Raum. Sometimes from close mics, sometimes from overheads, sometimes just slapping it straight on room mics. A little distortion (Decapitator, Devil Loc) after is often helpful.\n\nWith all of these solutions, the thing that seems to help them gel with the rest of the real kit is drum bus processing - compression and/or saturation.",

I've been playing with this effect for about 25 years and even yesterday had an artist at the house where we did vocal takes at different distances from the mic. never stop experimenting and learning!",

The world isn't fair, mostly no one who would hire you actually cares about how you are feeling or what's happening in your life. Or even some sense of loyalty for what we have done before. Do we bring value? And how can we bring more? That's all that matters really. And it is brutal and hard. It still very much is for me too.

    "content": "Process/Theory:\nI see lots of people\u2019s previous responses say they begin with getting the overheads to sound great and then start blending in close mics. If the drums were recorded by someone who knew what they were doing, with a good sounding kit, in a nice room \u2014 this would be a wonderful way to approach things. However 90% of the time that\u2019s not the case with tracks that come my way. So I\u2019m solving fro two problems \u2014 making the drums:\n1) The foundational rhythm element. It doesn\u2019t matter how good tonally your drums sound, they need to fill specific duties to carry the rhythm of the song. This is usually problem solving with phase within the elements of the drum set and then mostly getting the kick and snare to sit right around the rest of the instruments. Literally getting the right transients in the right frequency ranges \u2014 agnostic of \u2018tone\u2019 and \u2018vibe\u2019.\n2) The sense of space for the mix. The drums are a huge part of this\u2026 and the foundation for the aesthetic of a mix. Is it a tight space? Big verby snare? This is all great, but will rarely deal with this stuff until #1 is taken care of. So my process starts with close mics.\n\nAfter poking around and listening to the close mic various options to get a sense of what I\u2019m working with, I\u2019ll start with getting everything in phase. Solo the kick drum mics and get those in phase with each-other. If they don\u2019t add up, I\u2019ll start playing with HP filters at various Q\u2019s to try and get things closer. You\u2019d be surprised what you can get away with even when things are even 90 degrees out. Then, I\u2019ll start introducing more spot mics (snare, toms, HH) and start getting things in focus with just phase flips. By the time you get to the overheads and rooms, you should have all the spot mics in phase with each-other so then you can get a better sense of how the overheads are going to play into the game.",

    "content": "I love (trying) to explain this because it always makes me think of new things to try.\n\nYou can stereoize a sound using lots of techniques, the main three being pitch, delay, and phase. Often times your favorite plugins will do combos of these, so flipping the phase on one side will sometimes kill some of your wideness.\n\nIt's worth doing a google, but something like a flanger is simply duplicating the signal and micro delaying one of them at a variable rate. So the duplicated signal might oscillate between 2-20 milliseconds, which makes that crazy flanger sound. If you take that duplicated signal and run it through an aggressive filter (which will introduce some phase shift) and that's what a phaser is. \n\nYou can play with multiple duplicate signals, flipping phase on one side and getting wild effects. You can play with pitch on the delayed signal and start getting an effect we call \"chorus.\" But of course, each of these types of effects are just combinations of fundamental ways to manipulate audio. Many combos are possible!\n\nHooray sound design!\n\nAlso, I would love @Slow Hand to correct and expand, since I know he (and many others on here) are REAL sound design nerds.",

Just like with the record side, there's so much noise from bedroom composers and people that have zero real-world experience. And as Ruairi is always saying, even the people with real success often can't teach what they know. Maybe I'm a bit cranky after an 8 hour delay at the airport yesterday, but Spitfire has gotten quite good at creating \"tutorial\" videos that are thinly veiled advertisements, and many of their libraries are the equivalent of one-knob plugins or CLA vocals. Selling paint-by-numbers solutions to na\u00efve kids who want to get into scoring (They're far from the only ones guilty of this). But to focus on some of the channels I think are actually worth their salt:\n\n8-Bit Music Theory: https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory/videos\nCan be a bit basic at times, but he talks a lot about structure which, IMO, is becoming a lost art in modern scoring.\n\nAnne-Kathrin Dern: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJg1w7F3PKPbSpEF2YOejVjWAg-KcM3Z\nNot the biggest name out there, but she has a no-bullshit way of explaining things about orchestration and theory that is clear and concise. As far as \"teachers,\" I think she's a good one.\n\nAlan Meyerson Waves Sessions: https://youtu.be/h9jZqn5lnw4\nI hesitate to include this. I know for a fact that Alan swapped out a bunch of his go-to plugins to make everything a Waves product. I haven't watched this in awhile, but it's a good insight into how he sets up a big mix session and why he makes some of his decisions. He's also playing to the camera/audience some, so this is a your-mileage-may-vary recommendation.\n\nMcGowen Soundworks: https://www.youtube.com/@McGowanSoundworks/featured\nPhil knows his shit, and goes pretty deep breaking down a few actual mixes, which is pretty rare to find.\n\nIf I think of others, I'll report back.

It seems to me that if I cant build momentum working full time on music for ~6 months, its not happening, and I really have no free time w my current job + study situation\n\n-is working music jobs good for momentum, or does it hinder you? Im talking doing bar cover gigs for money/making content while building skills during the day\n\n-how is it living w roommates as a musician? Want to get out of my folks\u2019s somewhat soon, and trying to figure out the logistics of needing to practice or record every day",

Haven\u2019t seen you around these parts yet so I don\u2019t know your situation and can\u2019t speak to your specifics. But, there are some overarching philosophical ideas worth considering. \n\n1) the answer to each of these questions is different for every person. None of us got into music because we\u2019re risk averse and looking for stability, so dont think just cause you\u2019re \u201cgoing full time\u201d or you start calling it a \u201ccareer\u201d that somehow that will be different. \n\n2) and this is universally true, you\u2019ll never be younger or have fewer responsibilities than you do now.\n\n3) don\u2019t take the leap if you\u2019re not willing to: be poor. Have roommates. Eat ramen. Breakup with girlfriends/boyfriends who expect more from you. Borrow money for your cellphone bill. Drive a shitty car. Etc etc. \n\nBut also, if you don\u2019t bet on yourself, no one else is going to either.",

Maybe its that for you too, or you are new on this journey just like me. The folks here are (mostly) engineers who do this stuff for a living, ofcourse they value their own time. But in my opinion, how beautiful of a place would this be if we could ask the questions we actually want, if i am asking ruairi a question about eq, its not because my intention is to waste his time, its because i want to learn from him, i look upto him and i respect him, if he doesn\u2019t have the \u201ctime\u201d, maybe someone else will, but saying \u201cask better questions\u201d thats for sure very rude, especially to a newbie (this is the newbie chat) I genuinely think this is one of the most important audio communities on the internet.

They started getting attention from record labels and big producers in LA. I moved to LA and met Eric Valentine who liked the album and met with the band. I asked if I could intern for him. He said he didn't have interns but I should stay in touch cause sometimes they hired extra help. I called him every two weeks for the next six months until an opportunity opened up. Then I assisted him for five years while making indie records on the side.",

Not only is it harder to build trust, but the remote option is available to anyone with an internet connection. So you're competing with a much larger pool of people too.\n\nDoes that mean move to LA or London or Miami or wherever? Not necessarily.

But it\u2019s especially clear in synthesis in that case.\n\nOf course musical applications are much more complex, but that\u2019s why clipping (squaring off the top of a rounded waveform) adds harmonics\n\nThat\u2019s what people mean when they say it spreads the energy across the spectrum. In the case of a sin wave, you have a single fundamental. At the far other end, you have a square wave which has harmonics all up the spectrum of frequency",

    "content": "I would tell them there's a few things to consider when pressing vinyl:\n1) Mastering is especially important as it\u2019s the real bridge between the music and the mechanical production of the record. I had the great pleasure of mastering a few records for vinyl with Doug Sax (give him a google) and there\u2019s a lot more to the process than modern mastering for digital services. They will actually cut the acetate disc which will be what manufacturers use to make the metal stamper that actually molds the records. A lot of thought goes into this process such as the width of the grooves to accommodate bass frequencies, etc. If you want a good sounding record, there\u2019s no way around working with a seasoned professional.\n\n2) Side lengths are important, as is track order. The more music you put on a side of vinyl, the less fidelity it will have as a whole. There will be sacrifices in the manufacturing to accommodate all of the music, so it\u2019s best to keep your side lengths under 20 mins. Closer to 15 mins per side is ideal sonically, but sometimes that means doing double records and that just gets expensive. Also the order in which the tracks play on each side plays a part. The songs at the beginning of the side have more bandwidth and less distortion\u2026 it basically diminishes the closer you get to the center. Whatever the last track on the side is will just sound worse. It\u2019s a flaw in the medium\u2026 so think about that.",

I\u2019ve had cool moments and landed spotify placements as a mixer for artists, and there\u2019s this part of me that\u2019s still somewhat ashamed that I do a lot more work for free than I care to admit. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the comments on the old episodes that has me spooked (Jon on #61 re: \u201cnot everyone can be a mixer\u201d), but is this like just me or do even some of the really wicked smart people here still feel that\u2014and if so, how do you guys handle the it?",

Of course, you first need to understand the tools in order to understand why people use them in certain ways in specific situations, so building your knowledge of the fundamentals is important.\n\nIn general beware of anything with hyped titles like \u201c30 MIXING HACKS I WISH I KNEW\u201d. The internet is awash with misinformation, so it\u2019s important to assess who the information is coming from, and what their agenda may be (whether that\u2019s building subscribers, or shilling a product etc).

She sells the recordings online, and the clientele is presumably people in gaming, film, and app dev. A lot of the recordings are double mid/side and we're trying to figure out what's standard or expected in those industries when it comes to deliverables for multichannel recordings. 3 channel for the client to decode? 4ch? 4 stems front, back, L, R? Mono front, mono back, stereo L/R? maybe a long shot but does anyone have experience in this world?",

In fact I think I'm in the best season of my life so far and it feels like everything is going right (aside: aren't you more likely to self sabotage when things are good than when they are bad?) to zoom out a little bit, i already know the answer. I'm doing too much at once, spreading myself thin beyond enjoyment. in the grit of a transition and it's clear where I'm going but I have no frame of reference for the timeline. A few years ago, I was mid-20s, in a band on a major, had roommates & cheap rent, and a chess app addiction. i was still a \"professional\" but things were extremely simple. in short, left the band, spent a few years mixing much more than producing, and now am swinging back that way. I'm about to turn 30, I have a mortgage, a (semi) dependent, my first real studio, an intern to set an example for, 5ish mixing clients at any moment, producing for 3 artists and co-prod/consulting on 2 other projects, playing occasionally in any of 4 different bands, and producing/recording some live performances (as well as starting a YT channel in this lane). In my experience at least, it really seems like something shifted at the top of this year, and I hate to say it but part of the fault is TikTok (is the rest of the fault mine?). Everything is urgent to everyone and nothing informs each other or oscillates together. It feels like a clock is constantly going \"tick, tock, tick, tock\" and the anxiety I once had over money is shifted completely towards my time management. Every time I look away from my phone I have 30 new texts. I think I'm crushing it in my professional demands but I don't know that I'm being the person I want to be for my friends, family and partner. I don't know that I'm setting a good example to this intern. I don't know that I'm there to take care of myself all the way.",

I've been sifting through a few different reference tracks recently, and I just listened to it on headphones for the first time. They do some really wild stereo stuff with the drums in the intro and the chorus - You can hear it really pronounced on headphones. It's actually a little disconcerting hearing the cymbals basically mirroring each other in the left and right like that - and the snare, too. The cymbals also have a very pronounced \"BWEEESHHH...\" sound. It's a very unique sound... I suspect there were a lot of room mics going on in that sound, but of course I have no idea.

It's extremely focused and his messaging is crystal clear.\n\nFYI, that excerpt is from an internal document for his business that was made public. It's all about orienting his staff towards how they do things, and what they are here to do. To get everyone aligned on the mission.

Is that the point of having daily vocal warm ups, where they're meant to keep you going for 4+ hours of singing when needed? Just trying to be pretty cautious of how I start out so I don't potentially build harmful habits with singing.",

    "content": "@oaklandmatt , your experience with EV is really interesting and makes me think about cultural differences. This question goes out to anyone with experience in this. I\u2019d love to have a mentor too. I\u2019ve been a musician since I was a kid, producing for 17 years and mixing for about 10. Even though I make a good living from this, I\u2019ve always missed having a mentor figure.\n\nIn my country there aren\u2019t many role models, so I\u2019ve always looked to the UK/US. That makes me wonder if my approach fits the Anglo world. I\u2019ve written to mixers I really admire, offering remote assistant work in exchange for learning, but most already have assistants or aren\u2019t interested. I get it\u2014I\u2019ve been approached the same way, and I can\u2019t always afford or fully trust an assistant either.\n\nA producer with big credits was very generous with me, taught me a lot, and said he\u2019d keep me in mind. Once he even contacted me for some drum edits on a known band\u2019s record, but he ended up doing it himself because he was in a rush. Over two years, I only reminded him twice that I was available. So when I read that you used to call EV every two weeks, it honestly blows my mind. That\u2019s where my question about cultural differences comes from\n\nIn my country that would feel inappropriate, but I often notice that in the Anglo world, insisting (within reason) isn\u2019t seen as a bad thing. Any advice? I\u2019m pretty shy and always afraid of coming off as annoying. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts guys",

It seems like internships/assistant positions are altogether quite rare these days, hopefully I can find something. Any advice for something you\u2019d like to see in a cold email?? Is that the route, or do you reckon establishing contact with other intentions first?\n\nYour advice on personal connections and trust really speaks to and affirms what I\u2019ve been trying to cultivate.

    "content": "To illustrate a good example of the difference and why (guessing) Jon would want to clip rather than do this (which would control the transients as you describe)\n\nIf you use a long look ahead, call it a limiter with a long look ahead. That will let the processor know about the transient well before it hits the GR circuit, thus avoiding distortion/harmonics (of course there still could be some artifacts). But even though there will be samples at the threshold, it won\u2019t be a straight line waveform as if you clipped it. It is pushing the waveform down. The waveform itself is actually changed still, so it is not exact but it\u2019s different than clipping.\n\nA clipper just squares it off. Hence harmonics.\n\nThis is why you can limit/compress an instrument like piano, which has a tendency to hear distortion easily, when clipping it would be a disaster (unless you are going for that)",
