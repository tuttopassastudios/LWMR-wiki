While there\u2019s something to be said about a mixer who worked with a band you like, a lot of that is the e band you like.\n\nWhile Cian has worked on bands and records I dig, if you pay attention to his discography it\u2019s not just one style. The style or genre isn\u2019t the through line, the consistent quality is. When looking for mixers, try to separate the mix from the band.",

      "content": "The landscape for pitching songs has changed dramatically in the last decade. It still exists, but it has shrunk to the point where even the top level writers can't rely on it as much.\n\nThis is simply because many more people can write songs and make demos quickly. This results in two things: the market is flooded with songs, and artists who used to rely on pitch songs are now writing (or co-writing) the majority of their material.\n\nMany songs that used to be sent to an artist are now brought into the room and finished with the artist themselves. Like, you'd pitch a chorus or a 3/4 finished song to an artist and finish with them on the spot.\n\nThe genres where pitching songs still predominates are country the (industry is still writer\u2013driven), EDM (many artists are performers who do not write or produce), and pop (but they're mostly just looking for HITS).\n\nAnother consequence of this shrinking pitch landscape is that the projects that need \"outside\" songs are much more gate-kept by people in the industry. In country, there are publishers and labels that generally source the songs. In pop, labels and executive producers (of specific projects) tend to be the gate keepers, and in EDM it is a similar combo.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the best way to pitch songs is to build direct relationships with artists or go through the various business people who gate-keep the process.\n\nTo advise you based on your question: make incredible records with your friends, peers, and the people around you, and get visibility that way. Hustle like crazy and use every moment of new visibility as a stepping stone to get in the mix with the larger music community. Ultimately you probably sign a publishing deal and sing with a manager where you get business representatives to help guide you and connect you further.\n\nAs with all things music, if you actually really for real make A+ records, people will find you. It's just that this is a lot harder than people think.",

It\u2019s more \u201coh the chorus is louder, let\u2019s knock it back a click or two on the input so it doesn\u2019t distort\u201d\n\nWe were usually recording songs in fairly small sections, making sure to get the details right. There wasn\u2019t a lot of jedi like fader riding. On very rare occasions if I knew there was going to be a huge dynamic shift I\u2019d reach out and grab the output fader, but I can probably count on one hand how many times I\u2019ve had to do that.\n\nWe were fairly conservative on the 1176 on the way in, largely cause you can\u2019t un crunch a vocal that\u2019s been over compressed, but once the vocal was in PT it would be hit by just irresponsible levels of compression and limiting. Like goes against how virtually every \u201cexpert\u201d online would tell you how to do it. Most people would tell you the solo\u2019d tracks would sound bad, but as part of the song their impact is objectively unarguable",

      "content": ".\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively)\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

      "content": "It's a big topic, but gain staging is about finding the optimal amount of gain at every stage of the recording and mixing process.\n\nGood gain staging allows you to get the best fidelity out of a recording by preventing things from creating unwanted distortion or amplifying unwanted noise. **OR** if you are *seeking* some distortion and compression it's about turning up the gain enough to give you the amount that you're seeking from your tools.\n\nGain staging is something to be considered at all steps of the production process. For example:\n\n*1. How loud is an amplifier turned up in the room? Is the microphone being blow out by it?\n\n2. How high is the gain on a microphone preamp and is it at risk of clipping if the performer plays loudly?\n\n3. Is the gain so low that when I turn a signal up later on the noise floor will rise with it?\n\n4. If I'm recording to tape, am I recording quiet enough that it won't saturate the signal, or do I want for the signal to slam the tape and be saturated?\n\n5. How loud is an individual channel in a DAW? Is it making the channel clip?\n\n6. How loud is a signal that's being sent into a piece of hardware or a plugin? Am I distorting the circuitry at all?\n\n7. Is my signal coming in so hot that it makes a compressor react way too hard?\n\n8. How loud is the entire track I'm mixing? Is the limiter crushing the dynamics in an unwanted way? Or am I hitting it just with just enough level to get a certain flavor of pumping and clipping?\n\n9. Is my final mix going to hit digital zero and create unwanted clipping?*\n\nSo gain staging is not a single thing, but a series of choices that are made every step of the way around how you manage the \"voltage\" of your signals. Together these choices all add up to a mix that \"breathes\" well and is free of excessive or unwanted distortion.",

      "content": "I have a couple distinct phases of my workflow. The \u201ctechnical\u201d phase let\u2019s call it, is all about letting my brain objectively search for the very specific kinds of things that are distracting within the mix at hand. This is much more of a thinking and corrective process than it is a feeling one, even though feeling and taste is 100% involved. This part of the process is to get the mix on a more solid foundation if needed.\n\nThe next phase is where I want to actively NOT be thinking at all. This is why I do the first part separately. I want to be FEELING the music in this phase and not be taken out of it by the vocal resonance at 1.8k at 1:35 in the bridge. I want to turn that part of my brain off so I can focus on the music, the feeling, the lyrics, the intent, the song and try to find where (or if) I can elevate or reveal or better frame the heart of what\u2019s there. This is meant to be the flow state, moving intuitively and viscerally based on what\u2019s coming out of the speakers. This is where efficiency in toolset matters -- where an extremely efficient human-computer interaction matters, where knowing your tools cold matters. I want to reduce latency between feeling and move and I don\u2019t want anything to get in my way. \n\nSo to answer your question: I think about ways to continue to be able to access and preserve that crucial flow state during the time where it matters the most. And it can manifest a million ways that aren\u2019t directly related to mastering at all: taking a walk, working out, doing a J, listening to a new record, checking Discord, unplugging, whatever. And yes, sometimes it also means refining my template or my Streamdeck shortcuts or creating a new preset.",

I'd say as years go on, I've learned to separate feelings of pressure/responsibility/schedule density from \"stress\" or being \"overwhelmed\" in the true sense. There's that Dale Becker quote, \"Don't feel victimized by your work.\" Making peace with what it feels like to be responsible for someone's record, or your own music, is important. It carries a lot of weight, but it's a privelage to be able to do it and it should not break your spirit. Not that that's necessarily what's got you feeling this way.\n\nLots of ways to dive deeper if you'd like to share more about where you're coming from.",

It finally clicked that many folks these days (especially in the pop world) are getting stems to mix from \u2014 not full multitrack sessions \u2014 and often not real drumsets/instruments in real rooms. In my world, for better or worse, I\u2019m almost always getting multitrack files. So the prospect of only spending 2-3 hours on a mix is just impossible. That will often times barely get me past the drum sound! So for us mere mortals that are still stuck mixing real instruments, here\u2019s my process for approaching drum mixing.",

      "content": "Nailed it Will. Split mono is a step in my mix prep sequence. Efficient method goes like this:\n\nPT Downmixer stock plugin is the one for this (it collapses stereo channels to mono) - flip the phase of one side in the GUI and save that as your user default. If you insert your Downmixer on a faux stereo track, it\u2019ll immediately silence it, so you can happily split and delete what you don\u2019t need. \n\n(Check the meters though, sometimes ambience or other subtle stereo info isn\u2019t very audible unless cranked.)\n\nIf the stereo track contains slightly panned mono information, pushing/pulling either of the faders in Downmixer will quickly get it to cancel, and you can note how much extra gain you need to add or subtract when level matching in the final step (below). Obviously if it\u2019s deliberately panned info, you can either just leave the track stereo or match the pan position by ear (I prefer to do this because I like mono channels to behave like mono channels, and also half the CPU you\u2019d use on a stereo track).\n\nFinally, use clip gain to add 3dB to the resulting mono channel, and obviously pan it centre. This makes up for the level change according to default pan laws in Tools (-3dB).",

      "content": "i love this question. i've been doing this for long enough that the cycles of how records sound has changed several times. so every few years i try and take some time to unlearn/relearn.\n\nthere's no good short answer, but i'd start with taking some time outside of mixing to just listen to records. whether you've done this before or not, get to know your speakers and your monitoring environment better than before. listen to your favorite records that you know well, and make some tweaks. you don't necessarily have to redo your whole setup, but listen to your speakers in slightly different positions, different settings on the back of the speaker, etc. and really dig into listening and enjoy yourself.\n\nthat's usually enough to make me think about mixes very differently (which ultimately means i get better when i re-incorporate most of the things i already know). but if you need more, just try and simplify. start a mixing by just leveling everything. clip gain and leveling and panning. then balance frequencies and compress (via compressor or saturator or limiter or whatever). basically, with fresh ears, go back to basics.\n\nnot sure if that will transform you into a new mixer, but that's an outline of an approach i use when i feel like i need a big talent upgrade",

      "content": "I'm going to take a stab but it's a little picky on the terminology and it's long-winded:\n\nUsually working with a mixer is like driving down a one way street in terms of file swapping.  You typically bring in a mixer when your song and production is fully complete, you've made it the best version of itself you could reach on your own but still want to bring in someone with more experience to help you take it to that next level of polish.  So typically in this version of a client/mixer relationship you probably wouldn't ever ask for the multitrack post-edit without some sort of unique circumstance that you'd be communicating with them directly.\n\nIt sounds to me in your other conversations here that in your case, the mixer is really filling a engineering/additional production role in your project.  They are taking files of yours before they can see the entire picture of the song and helping shape the tones, doing the editing, and managing the files for you as you submit more pieces to them over time.  In this type of working relationship files are typically shared in a two way street style.  You both are collaborating and working together toward the finish line.  This role is not something I would call a mixer though - they may still do your final mixes but they are also acting as an engineer or even producer.\n\nI know this is being a little semantic but I think it's important because the context changes how you can describe it as customary or not.\n\nAs always, you'll need to chat directly to them and explain a bit why you want to get those edited multitracks back.  My first assumption sadly if I were in your buddy's shoes is that you weren't happy with the work and wanted to send those files to someone else.  So if that's the case, let them know early, and if that's not the case, let them know why you want the files.",

It's helpful to have some money in the bank, because it's going to take awhile for things to start happening. The more connections you have, the more in-roads you've made, the easier it will be to drum up work in music and keep the lights on. The less responsibilities and overhead you have, the easier the beginning stages of freelance life will be.\n\nDon't think about your music career in terms of the same metrics as your day job, you're burnt out on it for a reason. So instead of \"am I making what I made before,\" think \"can I survive on this for now?\" and if not, \"what will get me to a place that I can afford to pursue this dream?\"\n\nAny music job can be a boon for your career, and chances are you don't know where the opportunities will come from. The Beatles became the Beatles by playing cover songs at shady clubs, honing their sound and learning to play with each other. For someone else, that would've been a mindless, thankless gig with no upside. When they started playing better gigs, they were ready and stood out because of it.\n\nHow you do anything is how you do everything - if you're an intern at a studio cleaning up trash, you may be around huge artists and engineers. If they see you as dependable, friendly, going above-and-beyond, there's a tiny chance that a life-changing opportunity could emerge. Likewise, if they see you doing a sloppy job, that's how they're going to assume you'd be in the room, too.",

Start there, even if it's as simple as telling a different story with your chords over eight bars versus four bars.\n\nPlay with the harmonic rhythm of your chord changes. Some very basic examples:\n1. Instead of a single chord every measure, alternate between one chord per measure and two chords per measure.\n2. Hold on a single chord for six measures and then do a cadence with a quick succession of chords on bars seven and eight.\n3. Take your progression and play it at half the speed (a four bar progression becomes an eight bar progression).\n\nI know you said you're just making beats right now, but chords or a melody are going to inform and motivate your \"players\" and show them what to do. There needs to be some \"meat\" to the song for them to react to. If you don't like the melody you can mute it later. But give your \"players\" something to react to.",

I\u2019m usually (like almost always) getting the punch totally from the kick, so a faster attack usually feels pretty good to me, at least for the compressor not in parallel.

Speaker cables in particular do not use the common as shielding where unbalanced line level (like consumer RCA) and instrument level cables do. \nBalanced signaling like mics and pro audio line level equipment requires a \"hot\" signal, a \"cold\" signal (either polarity inverted hot or just nothing but with the same source impedance), and a common (ground/shield). At the receiving end of the connection, there is what's called a differential amplifier. Short version, a differential amp polarity inverts cold and combines it with hot, thereby reducing common mode noise by cancellation (and also some distortion, but we'll get back to that later).",

You can add delays, phasing, pitch shifting, etc to make it sound 'wide'... and yes, it will theoretically take up more space in the mix. As far as taking up more headroom, there's just too many variables to figure out there. But if you have the mono sound on a mono track, and the mono sound on a stereo track, with modern pan laws, they would both take up the same headroom.",

      "content": "Are you looking for resources on writing/production, or mixing? Just like with the record side, there's so much noise from bedroom composers and people that have zero real-world experience. And as Ruairi is always saying, even the people with real success often can't teach what they know. Maybe I'm a bit cranky after an 8 hour delay at the airport yesterday, but Spitfire has gotten quite good at creating \"tutorial\" videos that are thinly veiled advertisements, and many of their libraries are the equivalent of one-knob plugins or CLA vocals. Selling paint-by-numbers solutions to na\u00efve kids who want to get into scoring (They're far from the only ones guilty of this). But to focus on some of the channels I think are actually worth their salt:\n\n8-Bit Music Theory: https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory/videos\nCan be a bit basic at times, but he talks a lot about structure which, IMO, is becoming a lost art in modern scoring.\n\nAnne-Kathrin Dern: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJg1w7F3PKPbSpEF2YOejVjWAg-KcM3Z\nNot the biggest name out there, but she has a no-bullshit way of explaining things about orchestration and theory that is clear and concise. As far as \"teachers,\" I think she's a good one.\n\nAlan Meyerson Waves Sessions: https://youtu.be/h9jZqn5lnw4\nI hesitate to include this. I know for a fact that Alan swapped out a bunch of his go-to plugins to make everything a Waves product. I haven't watched this in awhile, but it's a good insight into how he sets up a big mix session and why he makes some of his decisions. He's also playing to the camera/audience some, so this is a your-mileage-may-vary recommendation.\n\nMcGowen Soundworks: https://www.youtube.com/@McGowanSoundworks/featured\nPhil knows his shit, and goes pretty deep breaking down a few actual mixes, which is pretty rare to find.\n\nIf I think of others, I'll report back. Hope that helps",

That said There are people that sum 4 mics down to 1 signal on a mixer and it sounds amazing.  \n\n2. The more performances  you add of the same part, the more blurry it will sound.if you need different textures, consider recording a DI so it can be blended in with your amp in any manner of your choice, either reamping, distorting with a plugin, whatever. (Check phase)\n\n3. I like when the left and right are *subtly* different, no drastically different. You hear \u201cthe left and right being different is what makes something wide\u201d\nThis is true. But I loathe when it\u2019s so different it feels lopsided.\n\nHow do we address this? \n\n-double track using the same guitar so the tuning and intonation is most similar \n\n-change the amp head but keep the same cabinet/speaker so the overall EQ is similar but my the gain structure is different\n\nIf you use 2 different guitars, consider the scale lengths. This will change subtle intonation things, for better or worse.",

      "content": "Just taking the time to figure out the right changeover strategy and timing so that I could actually make the move once I basically had two fully functioning rigs stood up in parallel. My additional complicating factor is having a laptop that is a dupe of the studio rig, so keeping it all straight and everything in sync is a bit of a puzzle. \n\nI took the transition as the opportunity to phase out some mechanical drives so I had to get some new drives for the M4 instead of re-using the old Time Machine mechanical drive. The M4 mini only has Thunderbolt/USB C ports -- the M1 has USB A's and Thunderbolt/USB C's so I needed a TB hub to get my old USB hub to play on the M4. The move forced me to sort out my iLok strategy between my mastering rig and my production rig because it was quite messy (I ended up getting a 2nd iLok for the M4 to make things way easier between it and the laptop). It was just a lot of little stuff for me. If you're not changing machine form factors and it's mostly a software exercise, then it might be worth it.",

I'll peel back the ratio once I have everything triggering properly to let some bleed in to taste. Sometimes I'll only gate 2-3 dB to just get something to pop. Sometimes its in a vaccum.\nI will very rarely compress individual drum mics. And I pray that the recording engineer didn\u2019t either. I like most of my compression to come from the busses. It sounds more natural to my ear and allows you to get away with a more compressed, exciting sound than just whacking the close mics. I\u2019ll find at the beginning my drum mixes will be very \u2018pokey\u2019 \u2014 I want each drum to sound explosive and over the top. That way when i start compressing them, they maintain their transient quality when they start getting dynamically reduced.\n\nI\u2019m always cutting tons of 250-350 out of the kick drums and trying to manufacture any attack with saturation instead of EQ. Having a SansAmp or a Saturn plugin adding high end always sounds more natural to me than just additive EQ. I\u2019m always very wary of the 2-5khz region, and find even-order harmonics are the best bet to fill in the blanks there.\n\nI tend to like my snare drums warm, so often low-shelving down the super low end and keeping the 150-300 \u2018boosh\u2019 intact. I try to avoid using HPF on drum mics because at this point, things should be relatively in phase, so if I put a filter on, it\u2019s going to throw the whole kaboodle off whack. Shelves are your friend here. And same as with the kick drums re: adding high end \u2014 I\u2019m wary off adding the snap in the 2-5khz range, I\u2019ll try and have the body of the snare drum really singing so I only have to add a little bit of top end, often above 5khz just for some air.",

So this should look really similar to the sidechain settings in the stock compressor.

With the stock Ableton plugins this happens automatically when you engage the sidechain but for 3rd party you have to add it manually.  I don't have F6 but looking up an image of the plugin it looks like the option is in the bottom right (2nd picture).\n\nIf that doesn't work then I'm not sure what's going wrong.",

      "content": "Hey I've got a question for people who regularly use IG and FB to run ads:\n\nI'm a very light IG user and a long-gone FB user (10+ years without an account). I've recently had cause to begin experimenting with running Meta ads (my ultimate goal here). \n\nLong story short I cannot run the ads that I want without linking both my IG account and my (newly created) FB account that I created solely to fulfill the requirement that will allow me to create ads. The problem is I think I've somehow created **two** new FB accounts in the process and I think my IG account is linked to the wrong one in a way that makes it impossible for me to run ads or connect to the 2nd FB account that I suspect will allow the Meta Business Suite to function properly.\n\n**So my question is this:** Has anyone encountered similar problems with two Meta accounts that need to be unlinked and re-linked correctly? FB support has been no help because there are no support reps to contact and get someone on the phone to problem solve. Their support is nothing more than an extensive FAQ that I've plumbed and still can't find a solution. There are no human operators to speak with and I've been seeking an answer for a week now with no luck.\n\nI'm embarrassed to even be asking this because the process of running ads through Meta already runs counter to my personal convictions around online-tracking and such. So this cognitive dissonance on top of my current frustrations with the process is draining my resolve to solve this problem. Hence me asking this question here as a hail mary.",

So bear with me.\n\nSo I think I've somehow created two FB profiles.\n\nI have a FB profile that logs in using the same email address as my IG account. This FB account is devoid of content, except for a random photo of a houseplant that I set as my profile pic so that I could distinguish it from what I believe to be a separate FB account that is also paired to my Meta Business Suite account.\n\nThe reason I think I have two FB accounts is because when I log into the Meta Business Suite it has thumbnails for all of the linked accounts: My IG account (represented with my IG profile pic) and my FB account which is has a blank default profile image. Not the houseplant profile image on my 2nd FB account that I setup.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but I was able to post a \"test post\" to my \"blank\" FB account and in certain windows within the Meta Business Suite I can see that that test post was successfully posted to the timeline. However, on my \"houseplant\" FB profile the test post doesn't appear. So I feel confident that these are two separate profiles.\n\nNeedless to say the whole thing is perplexing and I cannot find the means to distinguish one from the other. I see one FB profile through the Meta Business Suite and I see the other FB profile when I log in through the FB website. It's a mess. \ud83e\udd26",

In fact I think I'm in the best season of my life so far and it feels like everything is going right (aside: aren't you more likely to self sabotage when things are good than when they are bad?) to zoom out a little bit, i already know the answer. I'm doing too much at once, spreading myself thin beyond enjoyment. in the grit of a transition and it's clear where I'm going but I have no frame of reference for the timeline. A few years ago, I was mid-20s, in a band on a major, had roommates & cheap rent, and a chess app addiction. i was still a \"professional\" but things were extremely simple. in short, left the band, spent a few years mixing much more than producing, and now am swinging back that way. I'm about to turn 30, I have a mortgage, a (semi) dependent, my first real studio, an intern to set an example for, 5ish mixing clients at any moment, producing for 3 artists and co-prod/consulting on 2 other projects, playing occasionally in any of 4 different bands, and producing/recording some live performances (as well as starting a YT channel in this lane). In my experience at least, it really seems like something shifted at the top of this year, and I hate to say it but part of the fault is TikTok (is the rest of the fault mine?). Everything is urgent to everyone and nothing informs each other or oscillates together. It feels like a clock is constantly going \"tick, tock, tick, tock\" and the anxiety I once had over money is shifted completely towards my time management. Every time I look away from my phone I have 30 new texts. I think I'm crushing it in my professional demands but I don't know that I'm being the person I want to be for my friends, family and partner. I don't know that I'm setting a good example to this intern. I don't know that I'm there to take care of myself all the way.",

I really like \"marimba 2\" in pro tools for some reason. really easy to hear always, feels REALLY on time.\n\n2. Maybe try having a timed delay on one of your drum signals you can play off of. like a 1/16 note or triplet echo very faintly that, when you're in the pocket, grooves with your drumming. might be tough if you're doing really busy proggy stuff or if you're really worried about timing from an OCD perspective.\n\n3. if you have scratch guitar/bass tracks that were tracked to a click/perfectly gridded drum thing, playing along to that is usually far more inspiring and you can rely less on the click because you can just listen to the instruments.\n\n4. This is where having someone else record you helps. you might be totally in your head about this. a \"producer\" could be like \"bro that take was legit perfect\"",
