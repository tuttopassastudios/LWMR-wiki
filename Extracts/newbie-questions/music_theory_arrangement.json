A great writers block technique is to just a drop a song you dig into your DAW and start building on top of it. Lay down drums, maybe a counter melody. Now pull the original song out and you\u2019ve got a new song with the scaffolding of a hit. Very useful trick.",

    "content": ".\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively)\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

    "content": "I have a couple distinct phases of my workflow. The \u201ctechnical\u201d phase let\u2019s call it, is all about letting my brain objectively search for the very specific kinds of things that are distracting within the mix at hand. This is much more of a thinking and corrective process than it is a feeling one, even though feeling and taste is 100% involved. This part of the process is to get the mix on a more solid foundation if needed.\n\nThe next phase is where I want to actively NOT be thinking at all. This is why I do the first part separately. I want to be FEELING the music in this phase and not be taken out of it by the vocal resonance at 1.8k at 1:35 in the bridge. I want to turn that part of my brain off so I can focus on the music, the feeling, the lyrics, the intent, the song and try to find where (or if) I can elevate or reveal or better frame the heart of what\u2019s there. This is meant to be the flow state, moving intuitively and viscerally based on what\u2019s coming out of the speakers. This is where efficiency in toolset matters -- where an extremely efficient human-computer interaction matters, where knowing your tools cold matters. I want to reduce latency between feeling and move and I don\u2019t want anything to get in my way. \n\nSo to answer your question: I think about ways to continue to be able to access and preserve that crucial flow state during the time where it matters the most. And it can manifest a million ways that aren\u2019t directly related to mastering at all: taking a walk, working out, doing a J, listening to a new record, checking Discord, unplugging, whatever. And yes, sometimes it also means refining my template or my Streamdeck shortcuts or creating a new preset.",

My first real big break came from helping out with and swapping songs with a college buddy, who then managed to get a record deal, and I got to come up and help a little bit and meet with their producer. After a brief stint in Australia in another band, like Matt Rad, I relentlessly (but respectfully) kept reaching out to the producer to see if there was any toilets I could clean or any help at all I could give him, or even if he was just available for a quick lunch and could I play him some bands I was working on.  After a couple months he brought me in and taught me melodyne saying \u201cif you get good at this you\u2019re going to own a house someday\u201d. \n\nThis post is coming from inside the house. \n\nI think the mistake a lot of people make is they reach out hoping that someone can help them, and not with the intent of how they can help the person they\u2019re reaching out to. I never planned to be Vocal Producer to the Stars \u2122\ufe0f but it turned out it was a job that needed to be done that other people didn\u2019t want to do, and I started to get passed from big name producer to bigger name producer, and then I got enough clout to actually be the middle sized name producer.

If I\u2019m tuning multiple vocals, I tune the lead and mute other melodic instruments that might be distracting. Then tune  doubles to the lead, tune  the harmony with the lead, tune the  doubled harmonies to the tuned harmony and so on. I try to move fast not worrying about it being perfect and I then solo all the vocals together the see how they feel or put them back in the mix. As I\u2019m working on the song if something feels off I\u2019ll scope it out then. For me It\u2019s very easy to get into a hyper tuning mode where everything sounds like it needs tuned if I obsess over it. I find it better to do a broad stroke pass and fine tune things as needed",

I think you\u2019re going to hit some sonic limitations with the quality of your signal path and the cymbals you are using, but the drums sound pretty good and the space you\u2019re in isn\u2019t terrible. Some notes:\n- Your cymbal mic'ing approach might be a little overly comprehensive. Its nice to have spot mics on each cymbal, but might be worth trying a more traditional overhead approach. It\u2019ll help get a more natural image of the kit and will likely free up some microphones for other spot positions on the drum set or in the room.\n- Your kick drum sounds like a basketball. Theres a few things you can do with tuning, but I would firsttry having some dampening inside. If you like them sounding wide open, then consider taping some felt or paper towels to the inside of the drum shell, at least half way around the interior circumference of the shell. It\u2019ll help quash that bouncing basketball sound.\n- Your snare sounds beefy! Obviously, its going to be song and arrangement dependent, but on its own it sounds like you could voice it a little higher to get it to crack a little more.\n- If you free up some mics by simplifying your cymbal setup, consider having a mic at the \u2018crotch\u2019 position\u2026 picking up the center of the kit. It can be useful for anchoring the mono signal of the drums and gives you something nice to potentially squash or distort down the road.\n- Your room mics sound pretty good with the right EQing!",

    "content": "I started getting serious about recording while I was in college (studying chemistry). I was playing bass in a band at the time and I was the only one that had any sort of decent recording equipment. I found myself being the guy recording all of the band's demos before we went into a 'proper studio'. Eventually, we realized my demos were sounding better than the ones we paid other people to record! Meanwhile, I started assisting (for free) at a local small recording studio and met a really great mentor. The studio was small and its business was mostly weekend warrior type stuff \u2013 nobody really notable. That being said, it was a working studio \u2013 and booked almost 6-7 days a week. The producer was the big fish in the small pond and had a great repeat clientele. Most of the music was not my cup of tea \u2013 but this proved to be a good thing as I was exposed to all sorts of different styles and it allowed me to be comfortable in genres of music which I normally wouldn't gravitate towards. It just made me comfortable around music and musicians in general.\n\nOnce I graduated and decided I wasn't going to use my chemistry degree, I ended up helping the producer build a bigger studio complex from the ground up. I learned an insane amount of stuff during this period \u2013 whether it was researching which Pro Tools system we would need to helping design the wiring layout to actually implementing it all. Ultimately, after months of hard work (and lots of borrowed money) the studio was complete and it was ready for business. I worked here for 2 years or so until I got introduced to Eric Valentine through former Street To Nowhere guitarist Matt Radosevich in Los Angeles. He needed a new full-time assistant and so I hopped at the opportunity and moved to LA \u2013 leaving behind the studio and crew I helped build (they're still going today and they're doing great).",

Generally they want me to do the heavy lifting. When that kind of artist is in the room they aren\u2019t really contributing and I get distracted and am less efficient. Once I have something to share I\u2019ll bring the artist in and give them the opportunity to steer the song in whatever direction, change the arrangement, nix parts or ideas etc\u2026 if I\u2019m working with artist 1) I want them there whenever I\u2019m working on the song. There\u2019s immediate feedback. Usually way easier to work for me this way.",

    "content": "What are you doing for chords? A common pitfall of static arrangements is getting locked into the same four bar chord loop. Sometimes you've got to break out of that. Start there, even if it's as simple as telling a different story with your chords over eight bars versus four bars.\n\nPlay with the harmonic rhythm of your chord changes. Some very basic examples:\n1. Instead of a single chord every measure, alternate between one chord per measure and two chords per measure.\n2. Hold on a single chord for six measures and then do a cadence with a quick succession of chords on bars seven and eight.\n3. Take your progression and play it at half the speed (a four bar progression becomes an eight bar progression).\n\nI know you said you're just making beats right now, but chords or a melody are going to inform and motivate your \"players\" and show them what to do. There needs to be some \"meat\" to the song for them to react to. If you don't like the melody you can mute it later. But give your \"players\" something to react to.",

    "content": "Of course depends on the tempo, part, sound of the drums, aesthetic of the track - but a few things that have worked in different scenarios for me:\n\nCreate the impression of some distance to walls by sending snare (start there, maybe add other mics) to a short stereo delay. Often something like 90ms on one side, 120ms on the other. Feel it out on one side, then add some time to the other.\n\nTry adding some fake distance to your existing room mics with a simple delay with no feedback (there\u2019s a Steve Albini drum video on YouTube where he demonstrates this). You can delay both sides equally, or solo one side, delay it til it feels good/sounds cool, then do the other. Anything from 12ms-around 23 seems to work. From there things start to become more like a slap, but than can be cool too.\n\nSmash up your existing rooms a bit, or a lot. Omnipressor, Devil Loc, UAD Zener, decapitator, Rough Rider (free), Arousor/Distressor in nuke, Lo-Fi. \n\nSend to a gated verb - Cian shared a drum session a while back with a short VintageVerb preset that\u2019s often useful. RMX16 Non-Lins can be good too, although it\u2019s easy to bring things into 80s territory this way.\n\nSend to a short room verb like ocean way, SP2016, Pro-R, Valhalla Room, Raum. Sometimes from close mics, sometimes from overheads, sometimes just slapping it straight on room mics. A little distortion (Decapitator, Devil Loc) after is often helpful.\n\nWith all of these solutions, the thing that seems to help them gel with the rest of the real kit is drum bus processing - compression and/or saturation.",

    "content": "Process/Theory:\nI see lots of people\u2019s previous responses say they begin with getting the overheads to sound great and then start blending in close mics. If the drums were recorded by someone who knew what they were doing, with a good sounding kit, in a nice room \u2014 this would be a wonderful way to approach things. However 90% of the time that\u2019s not the case with tracks that come my way. So I\u2019m solving fro two problems \u2014 making the drums:\n1) The foundational rhythm element. It doesn\u2019t matter how good tonally your drums sound, they need to fill specific duties to carry the rhythm of the song. This is usually problem solving with phase within the elements of the drum set and then mostly getting the kick and snare to sit right around the rest of the instruments. Literally getting the right transients in the right frequency ranges \u2014 agnostic of \u2018tone\u2019 and \u2018vibe\u2019.\n2) The sense of space for the mix. The drums are a huge part of this\u2026 and the foundation for the aesthetic of a mix. Is it a tight space? Big verby snare? This is all great, but will rarely deal with this stuff until #1 is taken care of. So my process starts with close mics.\n\nAfter poking around and listening to the close mic various options to get a sense of what I\u2019m working with, I\u2019ll start with getting everything in phase. Solo the kick drum mics and get those in phase with each-other. If they don\u2019t add up, I\u2019ll start playing with HP filters at various Q\u2019s to try and get things closer. You\u2019d be surprised what you can get away with even when things are even 90 degrees out. Then, I\u2019ll start introducing more spot mics (snare, toms, HH) and start getting things in focus with just phase flips. By the time you get to the overheads and rooms, you should have all the spot mics in phase with each-other so then you can get a better sense of how the overheads are going to play into the game.",

If you want to get good, it is aactually pretty easy and anyone can do it with the right mindset and patience(key word here). Firstly stop playing on and off, just play as often as you can preferably every day if not every other day.  Stop worrying about scales chords and theory, and just play. Learn as many songs as you can, like really learn them. Your ear will get better at picking up details, like groove and technique over time, so just learn the songs as good as you can and then move one to the next. Try and make it through a 1000 songs over the next few years. You don\u2019t need to remember them, just get through them and move on. You will pretty quickly start recognising patterns in music and realise most music is made up of the same few combinations of chords notes and so on. At this point I would recognise learning some theory, so that you will be able to name those musical patterns be it cadences, notes, chords, extensions and so on.  Then depending on what with your playing. This next bit is super important. If you don\u2019t care about playing in bands or performing for people then you can do this whole thing by your self. But if you want to play with real people on a stage or a basement then you need to spend time playing with people as much as you can. Learn some songs go to a jam session either at a local pub, church or what ever you have in your city. Having friends who play is also great as you might be able to get a chance to play with them regularly, maby even make a band. When learning a song, make sure you can play it all the way through with either a metronome or a drum track before moving on. Video taping also helps to be able to get an objective look/listen to your playing so you will know, what you need to be mindful of. \n\nKeith Jarrett the pianist learned one 1000 songs the first year for a restaurant piano gig before he was known or good.",

    "content": "I love (trying) to explain this because it always makes me think of new things to try.\n\nYou can stereoize a sound using lots of techniques, the main three being pitch, delay, and phase. Often times your favorite plugins will do combos of these, so flipping the phase on one side will sometimes kill some of your wideness.\n\nIt's worth doing a google, but something like a flanger is simply duplicating the signal and micro delaying one of them at a variable rate. So the duplicated signal might oscillate between 2-20 milliseconds, which makes that crazy flanger sound. If you take that duplicated signal and run it through an aggressive filter (which will introduce some phase shift) and that's what a phaser is. \n\nYou can play with multiple duplicate signals, flipping phase on one side and getting wild effects. You can play with pitch on the delayed signal and start getting an effect we call \"chorus.\" But of course, each of these types of effects are just combinations of fundamental ways to manipulate audio. Many combos are possible!\n\nHooray sound design!\n\nAlso, I would love @Slow Hand to correct and expand, since I know he (and many others on here) are REAL sound design nerds.",

It\u2019s easy to overdo it, and satisfying enough that sometimes you don\u2019t know in the moment.\n\nUltimately you can be 100% in the right speaker or 100% in the left speaker, and pushing beyond that is tempting the gods. As far as I can conceive it, any process that attempts to widen a signal that\u2019s already entirely decorrelated must have the potential to reintroduce some correlation. Thinking again of the ping pong delay, is there really anything wider than that?\n\nI was doing a lot of M/S mix buss widening stuff a few years ago, and I realized that it could do some pretty weird shit to panned vocals and the like. While it feels like you can just \u2018turn up the sides\u2019, you\u2019re really doing something unnatural to the center, too, and the relationship between channels. Like you\u2019re choosing select bits of a sound to turn up, but only the bits of that sound that don\u2019t have anything in common with the other speaker. This is a lot of rambling just to say that there\u2019s clearly a point of diminishing returns, and maybe the solution is to pan something else less wide to create contrast.",

    "content": "Are you looking for resources on writing/production, or mixing? Just like with the record side, there's so much noise from bedroom composers and people that have zero real-world experience. And as Ruairi is always saying, even the people with real success often can't teach what they know. Maybe I'm a bit cranky after an 8 hour delay at the airport yesterday, but Spitfire has gotten quite good at creating \"tutorial\" videos that are thinly veiled advertisements, and many of their libraries are the equivalent of one-knob plugins or CLA vocals. Selling paint-by-numbers solutions to na\u00efve kids who want to get into scoring (They're far from the only ones guilty of this). But to focus on some of the channels I think are actually worth their salt:\n\n8-Bit Music Theory: https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory/videos\nCan be a bit basic at times, but he talks a lot about structure which, IMO, is becoming a lost art in modern scoring.\n\nAnne-Kathrin Dern: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJg1w7F3PKPbSpEF2YOejVjWAg-KcM3Z\nNot the biggest name out there, but she has a no-bullshit way of explaining things about orchestration and theory that is clear and concise. As far as \"teachers,\" I think she's a good one.\n\nAlan Meyerson Waves Sessions: https://youtu.be/h9jZqn5lnw4\nI hesitate to include this. I know for a fact that Alan swapped out a bunch of his go-to plugins to make everything a Waves product. I haven't watched this in awhile, but it's a good insight into how he sets up a big mix session and why he makes some of his decisions. He's also playing to the camera/audience some, so this is a your-mileage-may-vary recommendation.\n\nMcGowen Soundworks: https://www.youtube.com/@McGowanSoundworks/featured\nPhil knows his shit, and goes pretty deep breaking down a few actual mixes, which is pretty rare to find.\n\nIf I think of others, I'll report back.

In order for someone to give it a go with you, it would take some level of trust that they won\u2019t be getting back a fucked up mix. \n\nI\u2019m a producer that occasionally mix for others, and I found it the easiest to get in on earning people\u2019s trust by offering other things first.

People are more likely to record with someone they don\u2019t know yet than to have someone they don\u2019t know mix or produce their stuff.\n\nAs a producer, I\u2019d deny free offers from new mixer to mix what I\u2019m working on unless I have heard their work and I like them. I\u2019ve had people ask if I need mixing and offered through their relationship with the artists- it always came back fucked\u2026 at least so far. So try to get in with producers through offering other stuff like engineering in writing sessions. Comp and tune the demo vocals you got from the writing session, if you do a great job they\u2019ll more likely to give it a go with you. Don\u2019t ask too early, make sure you build a good rapport with them first. Vocal tuning can fuck things up just as bad as mixing, so try to find things where you can just do it (e.g. you just recorded vocals for someone) over asking people if they need their vocals tuned.",

That said There are people that sum 4 mics down to 1 signal on a mixer and it sounds amazing.  \n\n2. The more performances  you add of the same part, the more blurry it will sound.if you need different textures, consider recording a DI so it can be blended in with your amp in any manner of your choice, either reamping, distorting with a plugin, whatever.

You hear \u201cthe left and right being different is what makes something wide\u201d\nThis is true. But I loathe when it\u2019s so different it feels lopsided.\n\nHow do we address this? \n\n-double track using the same guitar so the tuning and intonation is most similar \n\n-change the amp head but keep the same cabinet/speaker so the overall EQ is similar but my the gain structure is different\n\nIf you use 2 different guitars, consider the scale lengths.

    "content": "I would tell them there's a few things to consider when pressing vinyl:\n1) Mastering is especially important as it\u2019s the real bridge between the music and the mechanical production of the record. I had the great pleasure of mastering a few records for vinyl with Doug Sax (give him a google) and there\u2019s a lot more to the process than modern mastering for digital services. They will actually cut the acetate disc which will be what manufacturers use to make the metal stamper that actually molds the records. A lot of thought goes into this process such as the width of the grooves to accommodate bass frequencies, etc. If you want a good sounding record, there\u2019s no way around working with a seasoned professional.\n\n2) Side lengths are important, as is track order. The more music you put on a side of vinyl, the less fidelity it will have as a whole. There will be sacrifices in the manufacturing to accommodate all of the music, so it\u2019s best to keep your side lengths under 20 mins. Closer to 15 mins per side is ideal sonically, but sometimes that means doing double records and that just gets expensive. Also the order in which the tracks play on each side plays a part. The songs at the beginning of the side have more bandwidth and less distortion\u2026 it basically diminishes the closer you get to the center. Whatever the last track on the side is will just sound worse. It\u2019s a flaw in the medium\u2026 so think about that.",

The minute I hooked it up I was able to monitor a lot louder without it having the feeling of hurting my ears- the increase in clarity was immediate. \nSo It seems to be the case that this subtle (intermodulation?) distortion literally hurts our ears and can make people go deaf. 40 of Drake was saying something similar, so I'm wondering if there's more to this.",

    "content": "I don\u2019t disagree with you, it\u2019s definitely a common workflow in rnb hip hop and it\u2019s how it\u2019s done more often than not. But even then, rappers write verses with pen and rnb writers can sing on their own to write a song. The way I\u2019ve been going about it is I ask if they have any lyrics at least- with people I have encountered the answer is almost always no. So as a producer, I don\u2019t really have any context to work with. And I\u2019ve tried- many times they end up really disconnected contextually even though they may sound right. \n\nIf they are putting out a lot of volume that they just prefer to get halfway there then it\u2019s a different story, but new artists with no music out yet or a few singles or one EP out having no lyrics or song on them is why I feel the way I do about \u201csend me a beat\u201d situation.\n\nMy perspective may not be as informed because haven\u2019t gotten to work with a good rapper yet. Some of the people that I have tried to work with that insist on this approach don\u2019t know how to work with fitting words into a bar unless they have drums.\n\nSame with RnB- I like to work with keys or guitar in the room and build together from ground up. But my experience has often been people just don\u2019t know what they want or don\u2019t know how to write on their own. \n\nMy frustration is- \u201ccan you at least tell me what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d. Whatever works, works. But if they don\u2019t have any thematic vision then I can barely see it working out \ud83d\ude26",

Not to mention the strings themselves. \n\nLighter guitars actually resonate / have more sustain usually, for obvious physics reasons that people ignored for a long time.",

What worries me is that some of the files that I didnt touch also don't align. I've exported them referencing the range of the instrumental track and ive also exported them using \"entire length\" as a reference. It always seems to happen. I've never had this happening to me, or I didn't notice.... Have you encountered this before? Is there an obvious workaround for this that I'm not getting?\n\nThanks!!",

I want to get good at more dynamic arrangement with linear development than vertical development (same instrumentation evolving with flowing energy vs parts in and out). I want it to have elements of interplay like a band playing in a room together, but fake it by overdubbing. \n\nI know dynamics can be achieved through taking things in and out or playing with different progressions/rhythm or moving octaves. From subtle to not so subtle changes. \n\nOne solution I could think of is writing one instrument part at a time with the goal of developing the arc. But this comes with the challenge of vertical movement\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I have clearly explained what my issue is, but my process usually goes like this. \n\n1) I have one or two elements looping together\n2) I pick up an instrument and search for ideas as it\u2019s looping\n3) once i have a solid idea, I\u2019ll start  recording and improvise around the idea \n4) take has tons of mistakes, playing wrong notes and off timing. I pick some parts out and then drop them in. \n\nNow the problem is I can get some cool ideas and happy accidents, but it\u2019s not usable yet. And it\u2019s hard to figure out where I should drop these little bits and pieces because there is no context (aka vocal). And without context, I don\u2019t know how I can move with intentions that will inform me what the next move is.",

When people get there, I then play just the drums, or whatever, and we start layering other stuff on top of them. I speed it up, slow it down, use various parts, cut and paste - basically just to get something that inspires me during composition. Later, I'll come back with real musicians and actually record it, but this is a pretty powerful demo creation method, for me at least. Kinda fun to un-mute the OG track at the end and be like \"yeah, it's been Interpol this whole damn time :)\"",

They do some really wild stereo stuff with the drums in the intro and the chorus - You can hear it really pronounced on headphones. It's actually a little disconcerting hearing the cymbals basically mirroring each other in the left and right like that - and the snare, too. The cymbals also have a very pronounced \"BWEEESHHH...\" sound. It's a very unique sound... I suspect there were a lot of room mics going on in that sound, but of course I have no idea.

I find Audacity to be excellent for pre pro because the click track feature and the time stretch feature are so incredibly malleable, and with many of my songs switching bpms all over the place, I rely on both of those features heavily during the initial crafting stage. Combined with their \"bpm markers plugin\" you're cutting and pasting and sliding around like no ones business. Audacity really is so, soo good for so many things. Many downsides, but for laying down scratch tracks nothing I've used compares. I could go further, but won't for the sake of brevity - and I don't want to get flamed. lol.",

Update: I was able to successfully download protools intro after several days of not being able to for some reason. During the interim, when I was waiting for avid to be nice to me, I figured out how to 1. Make the grid in Reaper line up with the click tracks that I imported from Audacity - Halleluia. OMG. I have been trying to do that forever. 2. Slip Edit in Reaper and Cubase 3. Use Stretch Markers in Reaper and nudge around little pockets of sound. Now, I have a TRUE and UNIQUE disdain for Reaper. I think it's unintuitive, I think it's cumbersome, I shudder to think of all the time I spent fiddling around with this Nerd-god of a fucking daw when I could've been soaring along in Cubase or Protools, and I'm honestly so, soo sick of it, but... as I'm sitting here with my Dell Lattiude laptop from 2013 with its 8 gigs of ram, trying to install Pro Tools Intro for the 5th time (wheel spinning for minutes on end and then just spontaneously shutting down), I'm thinking to myself, \"Is there any reason I shouldn't just dig my heels into Reaper and finish up this one album with it??\" There are some things I like about Reaper, and the fact that I now preeeetty much know what I need to in order to finish things out, I mean... I've got some serious technological limitations over here. Pro tools intro took 3 hours to download and I'm not even able to install it on my computer. Reaper runs fine (so does Cubase LE4)... I hate it, but I mean... This is where I'm at... Thank you, All.",

I'd imagine tuning can't be quite *that* fast but the stupid right click smart tool setup in melo has gotta be one of the slowest things I regularly use.",
