    "content": "The landscape for pitching songs has changed dramatically in the last decade. It still exists, but it has shrunk to the point where even the top level writers can't rely on it as much.\n\nThis is simply because many more people can write songs and make demos quickly. This results in two things: the market is flooded with songs, and artists who used to rely on pitch songs are now writing (or co-writing) the majority of their material.\n\nMany songs that used to be sent to an artist are now brought into the room and finished with the artist themselves. Like, you'd pitch a chorus or a 3/4 finished song to an artist and finish with them on the spot.\n\nThe genres where pitching songs still predominates are country the (industry is still writer\u2013driven), EDM (many artists are performers who do not write or produce), and pop (but they're mostly just looking for HITS).\n\nAnother consequence of this shrinking pitch landscape is that the projects that need \"outside\" songs are much more gate-kept by people in the industry. In country, there are publishers and labels that generally source the songs. In pop, labels and executive producers (of specific projects) tend to be the gate keepers, and in EDM it is a similar combo.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the best way to pitch songs is to build direct relationships with artists or go through the various business people who gate-keep the process.\n\nTo advise you based on your question: make incredible records with your friends, peers, and the people around you, and get visibility that way. Hustle like crazy and use every moment of new visibility as a stepping stone to get in the mix with the larger music community. Ultimately you probably sign a publishing deal and sing with a manager where you get business representatives to help guide you and connect you further.\n\nAs with all things music, if you actually really for real make A+ records, people will find you. It's just that this is a lot harder than people think.",

It\u2019s more \u201coh the chorus is louder, let\u2019s knock it back a click or two on the input so it doesn\u2019t distort\u201d\n\nWe were usually recording songs in fairly small sections, making sure to get the details right. There wasn\u2019t a lot of jedi like fader riding. On very rare occasions if I knew there was going to be a huge dynamic shift I\u2019d reach out and grab the output fader, but I can probably count on one hand how many times I\u2019ve had to do that.\n\nWe were fairly conservative on the 1176 on the way in, largely cause you can\u2019t un crunch a vocal that\u2019s been over compressed, but once the vocal was in PT it would be hit by just irresponsible levels of compression and limiting. Like goes against how virtually every \u201cexpert\u201d online would tell you how to do it.

    "content": ".\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively)\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

    "content": "It's a big topic, but gain staging is about finding the optimal amount of gain at every stage of the recording and mixing process.\n\nGood gain staging allows you to get the best fidelity out of a recording by preventing things from creating unwanted distortion or amplifying unwanted noise. **OR** if you are *seeking* some distortion and compression it's about turning up the gain enough to give you the amount that you're seeking from your tools.\n\nGain staging is something to be considered at all steps of the production process. For example:\n\n*1. How loud is an amplifier turned up in the room? Is the microphone being blow out by it?\n\n2. How high is the gain on a microphone preamp and is it at risk of clipping if the performer plays loudly?\n\n3. Is the gain so low that when I turn a signal up later on the noise floor will rise with it?\n\n4. If I'm recording to tape, am I recording quiet enough that it won't saturate the signal, or do I want for the signal to slam the tape and be saturated?\n\n5. How loud is an individual channel in a DAW? Is it making the channel clip?\n\n6. How loud is a signal that's being sent into a piece of hardware or a plugin? Am I distorting the circuitry at all?\n\n7. Is my signal coming in so hot that it makes a compressor react way too hard?\n\n8. How loud is the entire track I'm mixing? Is the limiter crushing the dynamics in an unwanted way? Or am I hitting it just with just enough level to get a certain flavor of pumping and clipping?\n\n9. Is my final mix going to hit digital zero and create unwanted clipping?*\n\nSo gain staging is not a single thing, but a series of choices that are made every step of the way around how you manage the \"voltage\" of your signals. Together these choices all add up to a mix that \"breathes\" well and is free of excessive or unwanted distortion.",

    "content": "I have a couple distinct phases of my workflow. The \u201ctechnical\u201d phase let\u2019s call it, is all about letting my brain objectively search for the very specific kinds of things that are distracting within the mix at hand. This is much more of a thinking and corrective process than it is a feeling one, even though feeling and taste is 100% involved. This part of the process is to get the mix on a more solid foundation if needed.\n\nThe next phase is where I want to actively NOT be thinking at all. This is why I do the first part separately. I want to be FEELING the music in this phase and not be taken out of it by the vocal resonance at 1.8k at 1:35 in the bridge. I want to turn that part of my brain off so I can focus on the music, the feeling, the lyrics, the intent, the song and try to find where (or if) I can elevate or reveal or better frame the heart of what\u2019s there. This is meant to be the flow state, moving intuitively and viscerally based on what\u2019s coming out of the speakers. This is where efficiency in toolset matters -- where an extremely efficient human-computer interaction matters, where knowing your tools cold matters. I want to reduce latency between feeling and move and I don\u2019t want anything to get in my way. \n\nSo to answer your question: I think about ways to continue to be able to access and preserve that crucial flow state during the time where it matters the most. And it can manifest a million ways that aren\u2019t directly related to mastering at all: taking a walk, working out, doing a J, listening to a new record, checking Discord, unplugging, whatever. And yes, sometimes it also means refining my template or my Streamdeck shortcuts or creating a new preset.",

Efficient method goes like this:\n\nPT Downmixer stock plugin is the one for this (it collapses stereo channels to mono) - flip the phase of one side in the GUI and save that as your user default. If you insert your Downmixer on a faux stereo track, it\u2019ll immediately silence it, so you can happily split and delete what you don\u2019t need. \n\n(Check the meters though, sometimes ambience or other subtle stereo info isn\u2019t very audible unless cranked.)\n\nIf the stereo track contains slightly panned mono information, pushing/pulling either of the faders in Downmixer will quickly get it to cancel, and you can note how much extra gain you need to add or subtract when level matching in the final step (below). Obviously if it\u2019s deliberately panned info, you can either just leave the track stereo or match the pan position by ear (I prefer to do this because I like mono channels to behave like mono channels, and also half the CPU you\u2019d use on a stereo track).\n\nFinally, use clip gain to add 3dB to the resulting mono channel, and obviously pan it centre. This makes up for the level change according to default pan laws in Tools (-3dB).",

    "content": "I'm going to take a stab but it's a little picky on the terminology and it's long-winded:\n\nUsually working with a mixer is like driving down a one way street in terms of file swapping.  You typically bring in a mixer when your song and production is fully complete, you've made it the best version of itself you could reach on your own but still want to bring in someone with more experience to help you take it to that next level of polish.  So typically in this version of a client/mixer relationship you probably wouldn't ever ask for the multitrack post-edit without some sort of unique circumstance that you'd be communicating with them directly.\n\nIt sounds to me in your other conversations here that in your case, the mixer is really filling a engineering/additional production role in your project.  They are taking files of yours before they can see the entire picture of the song and helping shape the tones, doing the editing, and managing the files for you as you submit more pieces to them over time.  In this type of working relationship files are typically shared in a two way street style.  You both are collaborating and working together toward the finish line.  This role is not something I would call a mixer though - they may still do your final mixes but they are also acting as an engineer or even producer.\n\nI know this is being a little semantic but I think it's important because the context changes how you can describe it as customary or not.\n\nAs always, you'll need to chat directly to them and explain a bit why you want to get those edited multitracks back.  My first assumption sadly if I were in your buddy's shoes is that you weren't happy with the work and wanted to send those files to someone else.  So if that's the case, let them know early, and if that's not the case, let them know why you want the files.",

It's helpful to have some money in the bank, because it's going to take awhile for things to start happening. The more connections you have, the more in-roads you've made, the easier it will be to drum up work in music and keep the lights on. The less responsibilities and overhead you have, the easier the beginning stages of freelance life will be.\n\nDon't think about your music career in terms of the same metrics as your day job, you're burnt out on it for a reason. So instead of \"am I making what I made before,\" think \"can I survive on this for now?\" and if not, \"what will get me to a place that I can afford to pursue this dream?\"\n\nAny music job can be a boon for your career, and chances are you don't know where the opportunities will come from. The Beatles became the Beatles by playing cover songs at shady clubs, honing their sound and learning to play with each other. For someone else, that would've been a mindless, thankless gig with no upside. When they started playing better gigs, they were ready and stood out because of it.\n\nHow you do anything is how you do everything - if you're an intern at a studio cleaning up trash, you may be around huge artists and engineers. If they see you as dependable, friendly, going above-and-beyond, there's a tiny chance that a life-changing opportunity could emerge. Likewise, if they see you doing a sloppy job, that's how they're going to assume you'd be in the room, too.",

That\u2019s a lot of abilities/capacities to learn/explore. A long the road you will have many needs being met. Consolation, support, validation, love, and more. An online forum can be a wonderful thing. In this case an extraordinary thing. It can\u2019t though meet all your needs and replace the presence of humans around you.

Generally they want me to do the heavy lifting. When that kind of artist is in the room they aren\u2019t really contributing and I get distracted and am less efficient. Once I have something to share I\u2019ll bring the artist in and give them the opportunity to steer the song in whatever direction, change the arrangement, nix parts or ideas etc\u2026 if I\u2019m working with artist 1) I want them there whenever I\u2019m working on the song. There\u2019s immediate feedback. Usually way easier to work for me this way.",

    "content": "What are you doing for chords? A common pitfall of static arrangements is getting locked into the same four bar chord loop. Sometimes you've got to break out of that. Start there, even if it's as simple as telling a different story with your chords over eight bars versus four bars.\n\nPlay with the harmonic rhythm of your chord changes. Some very basic examples:\n1. Instead of a single chord every measure, alternate between one chord per measure and two chords per measure.\n2. Hold on a single chord for six measures and then do a cadence with a quick succession of chords on bars seven and eight.\n3. Take your progression and play it at half the speed (a four bar progression becomes an eight bar progression).\n\nI know you said you're just making beats right now, but chords or a melody are going to inform and motivate your \"players\" and show them what to do. There needs to be some \"meat\" to the song for them to react to. If you don't like the melody you can mute it later. But give your \"players\" something to react to.",

This would be if the bass is doing mostly whole notes, to get it to fill more of the measure. If I\u2019m being specific about attack time... I\u2019m usually (like almost always) getting the punch totally from the kick, so a faster attack usually feels pretty good to me, at least for the compressor not in parallel.

Speaker cables in particular do not use the common as shielding where unbalanced line level (like consumer RCA) and instrument level cables do. \nBalanced signaling like mics and pro audio line level equipment requires a \"hot\" signal, a \"cold\" signal (either polarity inverted hot or just nothing but with the same source impedance), and a common (ground/shield). At the receiving end of the connection, there is what's called a differential amplifier. Short version, a differential amp polarity inverts cold and combines it with hot, thereby reducing common mode noise by cancellation (and also some distortion, but we'll get back to that later).",

The world isn't fair, mostly no one who would hire you actually cares about how you are feeling or what's happening in your life. Or even some sense of loyalty for what we have done before. Do we bring value? And how can we bring more? That's all that matters really. And it is brutal and hard. It still very much is for me too.

That family of Sennheisers are on the better end of wired / open-back headphones for sure, but I never got to the point of trusting them fully for mix translation. I experimented a bit with adding an Oratory EQ (using RME Room EQ on my interface) and that improved them quite a bit - much less of a mental adjustment when switching back to my Genelecs. The Airpods Max to me sound similar to the EQ-corrected Sennheisers, but with a more extended low end. Also the noise cancellation is great (love switching it on while mixing FOH!) I've started mixes on them and had very few translation surprises when switching back to monitors, albeit I still don't trust them enough to finish a mix yet.  For the price I think it's actually a great deal for what you get, considering Audezes are at least 2-3x the cost and  still need EQ to sound their best imho.",

Just like with the record side, there's so much noise from bedroom composers and people that have zero real-world experience. And as Ruairi is always saying, even the people with real success often can't teach what they know. Maybe I'm a bit cranky after an 8 hour delay at the airport yesterday, but Spitfire has gotten quite good at creating \"tutorial\" videos that are thinly veiled advertisements, and many of their libraries are the equivalent of one-knob plugins or CLA vocals. Selling paint-by-numbers solutions to na\u00efve kids who want to get into scoring (They're far from the only ones guilty of this). But to focus on some of the channels I think are actually worth their salt:\n\n8-Bit Music Theory: https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory/videos\nCan be a bit basic at times, but he talks a lot about structure which, IMO, is becoming a lost art in modern scoring.\n\nAnne-Kathrin Dern: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJg1w7F3PKPbSpEF2YOejVjWAg-KcM3Z\nNot the biggest name out there, but she has a no-bullshit way of explaining things about orchestration and theory that is clear and concise. As far as \"teachers,\" I think she's a good one.\n\nAlan Meyerson Waves Sessions: https://youtu.be/h9jZqn5lnw4\nI hesitate to include this. I know for a fact that Alan swapped out a bunch of his go-to plugins to make everything a Waves product. I haven't watched this in awhile, but it's a good insight into how he sets up a big mix session and why he makes some of his decisions. He's also playing to the camera/audience some, so this is a your-mileage-may-vary recommendation.\n\nMcGowen Soundworks: https://www.youtube.com/@McGowanSoundworks/featured\nPhil knows his shit, and goes pretty deep breaking down a few actual mixes, which is pretty rare to find.\n\nIf I think of others, I'll report back. Hope that helps",

I used to be an artist, so I have years and years of recording experience, and doing rough mixes for myself and the homies, but I\u2019m very new to this side of things. I was lurking around on here and I see that it\u2019s common when starting out that doing free mixes can easily turn into doing much more. I only have 2 real \u201cclients\u201d right now but I\u2019m mixing, producing, writing, recording\u2026 I love it, don\u2019t get me wrong. The more I can help, the better. I guess I\u2019m just having trouble navigating this space. Going deep with these 2 artists, I\u2019m having a hard time building a portfolio, which is messing with my confidence. Specially with mixing. I can get thumbs up from the people I\u2019m working with, my mentor (my old engineer), but without audience interaction I don\u2019t know what to do with that. I\u2019d like to take on more work, but I only have 1 mix out. Hopefully an EP a couple more mixes by the end of next month. I feel weird shopping myself with no portfolio, free work or not. I don\u2019t know where I stand, where to focus my energy and everything just feels like it\u2019s on slow-drip. Any advice?",

In order for someone to give it a go with you, it would take some level of trust that they won\u2019t be getting back a fucked up mix. \n\nI\u2019m a producer that occasionally mix for others, and I found it the easiest to get in on earning people\u2019s trust by offering other things first. Record them, or tune vocals for them and then let them know you also mix. People are more likely to record with someone they don\u2019t know yet than to have someone they don\u2019t know mix or produce their stuff.\n\nAs a producer, I\u2019d deny free offers from new mixer to mix what I\u2019m working on unless I have heard their work and I like them. I\u2019ve had people ask if I need mixing and offered through their relationship with the artists- it always came back fucked\u2026 at least so far. So try to get in with producers through offering other stuff like engineering in writing sessions. Comp and tune the demo vocals you got from the writing session, if you do a great job they\u2019ll more likely to give it a go with you. Don\u2019t ask too early, make sure you build a good rapport with them first. Vocal tuning can fuck things up just as bad as mixing, so try to find things where you can just do it (e.g. you just recorded vocals for someone) over asking people if they need their vocals tuned.",

My personal goal, is to get the sound to be as awesome and huge and perfect with 1 pair of guitar tracks doubled, with 1 mic on an amp. That\u2019s the ideal scenario for me. That said There are people that sum 4 mics down to 1 signal on a mixer and it sounds amazing.  \n\n2. The more performances  you add of the same part, the more blurry it will sound.if you need different textures, consider recording a DI so it can be blended in with your amp in any manner of your choice, either reamping, distorting with a plugin, whatever. (Check phase)\n\n3. I like when the left and right are *subtly* different, no drastically different. You hear \u201cthe left and right being different is what makes something wide\u201d\nThis is true. But I loathe when it\u2019s so different it feels lopsided.\n\nHow do we address this? \n\n-double track using the same guitar so the tuning and intonation is most similar \n\n-change the amp head but keep the same cabinet/speaker so the overall EQ is similar but my the gain structure is different\n\nIf you use 2 different guitars, consider the scale lengths. This will change subtle intonation things, for better or worse.",

Certainly not enough to quantify things like \u201chow much louder will I make your track.\u201d\n\nBest thing I did along the way was develop relationships with MEs. Usually one at a time, and worked through my questions in real time. Figured out what happened when masters come back and i felt amazing vs when they come back and I felt just ok. \n\nOver time I\u2019ve developed a philosophy for myself, (and while that changes/evolves over time,) I\u2019m now confident when I send a mix to master that what I\u2019ll get back will be a more finished  version of my ideas.

My additional complicating factor is having a laptop that is a dupe of the studio rig, so keeping it all straight and everything in sync is a bit of a puzzle. \n\nI took the transition as the opportunity to phase out some mechanical drives so I had to get some new drives for the M4 instead of re-using the old Time Machine mechanical drive. The M4 mini only has Thunderbolt/USB C ports -- the M1 has USB A's and Thunderbolt/USB C's so I needed a TB hub to get my old USB hub to play on the M4. The move forced me to sort out my iLok strategy between my mastering rig and my production rig because it was quite messy (I ended up getting a 2nd iLok for the M4 to make things way easier between it and the laptop). It was just a lot of little stuff for me. If you're not changing machine form factors and it's mostly a software exercise, then it might be worth it.",

The transients(which for me are absolutely crucial to hear when producing or mixing) are almost inaudible on the M50s, while decently audible on the 770s. I do not find the M50s or the 770s even close to \"well balanced\", they both are a bit too budget for that distinction(they both have extreme presence peaks at their respective frequencies). I know someone who is very happy with the Shure SRH940s and Shure 1840s for critical listening(same drivers, I think). The M50s and 770s are both pretty much unusable in the low end under 50-60hz for me, I don't feel they translate well there. A few mastering engineers use the Blue closed-back headphones as a low-end reference, they would probably be worth a try. Audeze stuff is pretty good for transient response, but more expensive.",

I\u2019m thinking about approaching some producers for some ad prod work, as I think the songs could really benefit from it a lift in some areas, and perhaps a few modern more current touches. Some sounds are a little dated at the moment. \n\nI\u2019ve never worked with producers in this kind of capacity before. What\u2019s the protocol/etiquette for this? Is it a case of approaching a couple of guys where I like the sound of their productions and starting a dialogue along the lines of \u2018this is what we\u2019re looking for, do you think you could bring something fresh to this?\u2019",

I would suggest that you adequately communicate that you just want the producer to add stuff and not completely change everything that you\u2019ve done. As long as you communicate, you should be fine. As for the mix engineer, when I\u2019m mixing for a client I never make production or arrangement changes unless the client tells me too, or if they\u2019re in the room with me. The mix engineers that I\u2019ve liked the least have made production changes when I haven\u2019t asked them to. As long as you communicate exactly what you want, you\u2019ll be good!

But if you\u2019re purposefully trying to go left field and straying away from what most people in western music is accustomed to! Then be all means go nuts! Try something like A Major over Bb Major it\u2019ll make your teeth grind!",

    "content": "I'll gate everything with the Pro-G. Usually as tight as I can while sometimes automating threshhold to make sure ghostnotes don't get lost. I'll peel back the ratio once I have everything triggering properly to let some bleed in to taste. Sometimes I'll only gate 2-3 dB to just get something to pop. Sometimes its in a vaccum.\nI will very rarely compress individual drum mics. And I pray that the recording engineer didn\u2019t either. I like most of my compression to come from the busses. It sounds more natural to my ear and allows you to get away with a more compressed, exciting sound than just whacking the close mics. I\u2019ll find at the beginning my drum mixes will be very \u2018pokey\u2019 \u2014 I want each drum to sound explosive and over the top. That way when i start compressing them, they maintain their transient quality when they start getting dynamically reduced.\n\nI\u2019m always cutting tons of 250-350 out of the kick drums and trying to manufacture any attack with saturation instead of EQ. Having a SansAmp or a Saturn plugin adding high end always sounds more natural to me than just additive EQ. I\u2019m always very wary of the 2-5khz region, and find even-order harmonics are the best bet to fill in the blanks there.\n\nI tend to like my snare drums warm, so often low-shelving down the super low end and keeping the 150-300 \u2018boosh\u2019 intact. I try to avoid using HPF on drum mics because at this point, things should be relatively in phase, so if I put a filter on, it\u2019s going to throw the whole kaboodle off whack. Shelves are your friend here. And same as with the kick drums re: adding high end \u2014 I\u2019m wary off adding the snap in the 2-5khz range, I\u2019ll try and have the body of the snare drum really singing so I only have to add a little bit of top end, often above 5khz just for some air.",

My usual go to has been 414ebs one on the high strings and one towards where the lower and middle strings meet, both kinda following the angle of the piano body. This never fails to get a great sound. If you can take the lid off try an aea r88 diagonally across the body one side pointing to the high strings one side pointing towards the low and mids, this has been one of the most natural sounds I\u2019ve EVER gotten from a piano. It just feels so real and right. You can also try some other great stereo mics like the sm69 on cardioid for both caps. Used to stick that in a similar position as the 88 with the lid on the big stick and then blanket the whole thing to fuck. You could get amazing separation even with drums in the room and it still sounded natural. There\u2019s also the humble 57!!! Don\u2019t sleep on those if you\u2019re after a very direct and contained sound you can get a couple of those on it and get exactly what you\u2019re after.",

I've recently had cause to begin experimenting with running Meta ads (my ultimate goal here). \n\nLong story short I cannot run the ads that I want without linking both my IG account and my (newly created) FB account that I created solely to fulfill the requirement that will allow me to create ads. The problem is I think I've somehow created **two** new FB accounts in the process and I think my IG account is linked to the wrong one in a way that makes it impossible for me to run ads or connect to the 2nd FB account that I suspect will allow the Meta Business Suite to function properly.\n\n**So my question is this:** Has anyone encountered similar problems with two Meta accounts that need to be unlinked and re-linked correctly? FB support has been no help because there are no support reps to contact and get someone on the phone to problem solve. Their support is nothing more than an extensive FAQ that I've plumbed and still can't find a solution. There are no human operators to speak with and I've been seeking an answer for a week now with no luck.\n\nI'm embarrassed to even be asking this because the process of running ads through Meta already runs counter to my personal convictions around online-tracking and such. So this cognitive dissonance on top of my current frustrations with the process is draining my resolve to solve this problem. Hence me asking this question here as a hail mary.",

So bear with me.\n\nSo I think I've somehow created two FB profiles.\n\nI have a FB profile that logs in using the same email address as my IG account. This FB account is devoid of content, except for a random photo of a houseplant that I set as my profile pic so that I could distinguish it from what I believe to be a separate FB account that is also paired to my Meta Business Suite account.\n\nThe reason I think I have two FB accounts is because when I log into the Meta Business Suite it has thumbnails for all of the linked accounts: My IG account (represented with my IG profile pic) and my FB account which is has a blank default profile image. Not the houseplant profile image on my 2nd FB account that I setup.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but I was able to post a \"test post\" to my \"blank\" FB account and in certain windows within the Meta Business Suite I can see that that test post was successfully posted to the timeline. However, on my \"houseplant\" FB profile the test post doesn't appear. So I feel confident that these are two separate profiles.\n\nNeedless to say the whole thing is perplexing and I cannot find the means to distinguish one from the other. I see one FB profile through the Meta Business Suite and I see the other FB profile when I log in through the FB website. It's a mess. \ud83e\udd26",

I HATE this thing, but I think in reality I really like most aspects of it (I/O, conversion, pres) and just hate the drivers.  It's glitchy, buggy, shitty, crackly, reboot-y.  Head's been dreaming about a new interface but the wallet has nightmares about a new interface, and an idea popped into my head.  Could I buy an RME Digiface USB and just connect the Zen Tour to it via adat?  Would that work?  Digiface is the interface and the Zen Tour is the monitor controller, converter, lines in/out, preamps?  Digiface is $400 at Thomann and that's a lot easier to swallow than a full-on replacement for the Zen Tour.",

I'm not super familiar with the evo, so anyone w/ experience with it i'd appreciate the input. Here's my setup. I'm sending from output 3 on the evo 8, via a xlr cable (w/ trs adaptor attached at the audient output side), into the input of a WA273.\n\nI am then coming out of the 273 into input 4 of the Evo 8. Using abletons external audio effect device & always am getting signal on output 3, but never any back on input 4. I know that the units are communicating, as if I crank all the input gain up on evo 8, & output on 273, it affects the white noise being sent through both.\n\nI've tried all different cables etc to make sure it's working, but it's always the same each time. Any thoughts? It could also be a evo 8 mixer thing which i'm inspecting now, still haven't gotten used to the software.\n\nApologies if the message is a little convoluted, my brain is being melted by this.

I want to get good at more dynamic arrangement with linear development than vertical development (same instrumentation evolving with flowing energy vs parts in and out). I want it to have elements of interplay like a band playing in a room together, but fake it by overdubbing. \n\nI know dynamics can be achieved through taking things in and out or playing with different progressions/rhythm or moving octaves. From subtle to not so subtle changes. \n\nOne solution I could think of is writing one instrument part at a time with the goal of developing the arc. But this comes with the challenge of vertical movement\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I have clearly explained what my issue is, but my process usually goes like this. \n\n1) I have one or two elements looping together\n2) I pick up an instrument and search for ideas as it\u2019s looping\n3) once i have a solid idea, I\u2019ll start  recording and improvise around the idea \n4) take has tons of mistakes, playing wrong notes and off timing. I pick some parts out and then drop them in. \n\nNow the problem is I can get some cool ideas and happy accidents, but it\u2019s not usable yet. And it\u2019s hard to figure out where I should drop these little bits and pieces because there is no context (aka vocal). And without context, I don\u2019t know how I can move with intentions that will inform me what the next move is.",

In my case I am set up with BMI in the US as my PRO and Publisher and have an admin pub deal with Sentric to collect in territories outside the US.\n\nAlso you'll want to be set up with SoundExchange to collect digital performance royalties (SiriusXM, iHeart, Pandora).  This often also involves the letter of direction that is kicked off with your producer agreement.\n\nI'm probably forgetting something but I'd highly recommend talking with a music lawyer to get things set up and working for you.",

In fact I think I'm in the best season of my life so far and it feels like everything is going right (aside: aren't you more likely to self sabotage when things are good than when they are bad?) to zoom out a little bit, i already know the answer. I'm doing too much at once, spreading myself thin beyond enjoyment. in the grit of a transition and it's clear where I'm going but I have no frame of reference for the timeline. A few years ago, I was mid-20s, in a band on a major, had roommates & cheap rent, and a chess app addiction. i was still a \"professional\" but things were extremely simple. in short, left the band, spent a few years mixing much more than producing, and now am swinging back that way. I'm about to turn 30, I have a mortgage, a (semi) dependent, my first real studio, an intern to set an example for, 5ish mixing clients at any moment, producing for 3 artists and co-prod/consulting on 2 other projects, playing occasionally in any of 4 different bands, and producing/recording some live performances (as well as starting a YT channel in this lane). In my experience at least, it really seems like something shifted at the top of this year, and I hate to say it but part of the fault is TikTok (is the rest of the fault mine?). Everything is urgent to everyone and nothing informs each other or oscillates together. It feels like a clock is constantly going \"tick, tock, tick, tock\" and the anxiety I once had over money is shifted completely towards my time management. Every time I look away from my phone I have 30 new texts. I think I'm crushing it in my professional demands but I don't know that I'm being the person I want to be for my friends, family and partner. I don't know that I'm setting a good example to this intern. I don't know that I'm there to take care of myself all the way.",

    "content": "Hey guys, sorry to get on here with this, but: I've just finished tracking drums for an album -10 songs, 16 microphones - I tracked in Reaper, but comping and editing in Reaper is TERRIBLY difficult for me; I generated all my click tracks in Audacity and flew them in Reaper to track along to, but I CANNOT get the grid in Reaper to line up with the \"grid\" that I made in Audacity. I can get everything to line up in Tracktion Waveform (really like that DAW), but Waveform doesn't have \"quantizing.\" Annnd... I think I need to quantize some shit?? - The drums are played really well, but there are just a few areas where I might need to nudge things a bit, perhaps take a fill from take 3 and put it on take one - Just generally nudge some things and do some copy pasting, cross fade etc... Help me. I need a bonehead simple DAW for this. I've been dreading this moment the whole time... I've seen some videos of people doing this type of thing in Stuido One and it looks easy, but I can not find their free version anymore - and I'm not sure it would have the features I need to do this??? Again... Help.",

I find Audacity to be excellent for pre pro because the click track feature and the time stretch feature are so incredibly malleable, and with many of my songs switching bpms all over the place, I rely on both of those features heavily during the initial crafting stage. Combined with their \"bpm markers plugin\" you're cutting and pasting and sliding around like no ones business. Audacity really is so, soo good for so many things. Many downsides, but for laying down scratch tracks nothing I've used compares. I could go further, but won't for the sake of brevity - and I don't want to get flamed. lol.",

Update: I was able to successfully download protools intro after several days of not being able to for some reason. During the interim, when I was waiting for avid to be nice to me, I figured out how to 1. Make the grid in Reaper line up with the click tracks that I imported from Audacity - Halleluia. OMG. I have been trying to do that forever. 2. Slip Edit in Reaper and Cubase 3. Use Stretch Markers in Reaper and nudge around little pockets of sound. Now, I have a TRUE and UNIQUE disdain for Reaper. I think it's unintuitive, I think it's cumbersome, I shudder to think of all the time I spent fiddling around with this Nerd-god of a fucking daw when I could've been soaring along in Cubase or Protools, and I'm honestly so, soo sick of it, but... as I'm sitting here with my Dell Lattiude laptop from 2013 with its 8 gigs of ram, trying to install Pro Tools Intro for the 5th time (wheel spinning for minutes on end and then just spontaneously shutting down), I'm thinking to myself, \"Is there any reason I shouldn't just dig my heels into Reaper and finish up this one album with it??\" There are some things I like about Reaper, and the fact that I now preeeetty much know what I need to in order to finish things out, I mean... I've got some serious technological limitations over here. Pro tools intro took 3 hours to download and I'm not even able to install it on my computer. Reaper runs fine (so does Cubase LE4)... I hate it, but I mean... This is where I'm at... Thank you, All.",

I'd love to hear, on a very basic level, how you all approach using the plugin and if there are any starting points that you would recommend. Also curious how this might change in different use cases (i.e. mastering, mix bus, drum bus). Are you simply sliding down the \"clip\" fader until you reduce the peaks a little and then making up gain with another plugin? Are you touching the other 3 faders at all? Do you find yourself frequently auditioning and changing modes and oversampling amounts or sticking to consistent setting. Thanks!",

I have a question about recording guitars: I have a bunch of songs that fluctuate a lot dynamically. Live, I use three or four clean boosts to drive my amp into different levels of distortion (jcm 800). The last time I did a record, I just did it as though i was playing live - just hitting the boosts along with the click when the song went into the different sections. It worked fine, but I've had many working engineers tell me that's NOT the way to do it. Rather, I should have recorded each section that has a different level of distortion/ intensity on its own, so that way I can have more control over the mix and end up with cleaner transitions, potentially... I'm just curious how people here may have handled such a thing. Not that it's important, probably, but I'll add that I don't use any volume or tone controls on my guitars - just humbucker straight to jack. I control all the dynamics with my pedals and strumming hand. Thanks.",

    "content": "Here\u2019s a simplified experiment you can do to explore what\u2019s going on when it comes to audible phase shifts within  a track.\nCreate a bunch of tracks with sine test tones, ideally harmonically related so you don\u2019t go crazy and so reinforcement/interference patterns are more noticeable, and just start flipping or rotating phase on some of them. See what if anything you hear.\nI\u2019m not deep enough on this to have the answer on a plate, but I think when we talk about hearing phase shifts on a single track, the times when that will be noticeable are when we have a lot of harmonically related content and they can either create constructive or destructive interference patterns depending on their phase. You\u2019re going to see changes in peak amplitude and I think that\u2019s a big factor. But yeah it\u2019s subtle stuff and not always the most significant factor in how things sound",

They're probably  not coming for outlets. A handyman will be your best bet to offload the work practically if you don't want to do it yourself. Like I said in deleted comments, if you going to do it yourself. Get the electricty detector pen. And check each outlet before starting. Even after turning off the breaker. Just cause the first 4 are off. The fifth might be on the washer and dryer breaker line a floor above. The electricity wont kill ya, but it will zoom ya. Also if renting landlord should be consulted first to see if theyll carry the weight of the task. Considering the state of the 30 plus year old outlets, probably unlikely. Your above question about protect you not the gear, I don't understand that framing? I used the AI to try and save myself from typing this..... alas",

    "content": "@oaklandmatt , your experience with EV is really interesting and makes me think about cultural differences. This question goes out to anyone with experience in this. I\u2019d love to have a mentor too. I\u2019ve been a musician since I was a kid, producing for 17 years and mixing for about 10. Even though I make a good living from this, I\u2019ve always missed having a mentor figure.\n\nIn my country there aren\u2019t many role models, so I\u2019ve always looked to the UK/US. That makes me wonder if my approach fits the Anglo world. I\u2019ve written to mixers I really admire, offering remote assistant work in exchange for learning, but most already have assistants or aren\u2019t interested. I get it\u2014I\u2019ve been approached the same way, and I can\u2019t always afford or fully trust an assistant either.\n\nA producer with big credits was very generous with me, taught me a lot, and said he\u2019d keep me in mind. Once he even contacted me for some drum edits on a known band\u2019s record, but he ended up doing it himself because he was in a rush. Over two years, I only reminded him twice that I was available. So when I read that you used to call EV every two weeks, it honestly blows my mind. That\u2019s where my question about cultural differences comes from\n\nIn my country that would feel inappropriate, but I often notice that in the Anglo world, insisting (within reason) isn\u2019t seen as a bad thing. Any advice? I\u2019m pretty shy and always afraid of coming off as annoying. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts guys",

The wording might sound weird: If I have the click track \"too loud\" in my headphones, I end up adapting with my drumming and my drumming kind of sucks a little bit - I end up compensating with my hits subconsciously because Im' kind of letting the click track \"hit\" for me. If that makes any sense. The way I can get around this is by having the click so that I can barely hear it. Only thing is, my drumming can be a little... less tight this way, and some measure of beat detective might have to be invoked at some point, if you get what I'm saying...",

    "content": "what you're saying makes sense. Couple things to try;\n\n1. different click sound! I really like \"marimba 2\" in pro tools for some reason. really easy to hear always, feels REALLY on time.\n\n2. Maybe try having a timed delay on one of your drum signals you can play off of. like a 1/16 note or triplet echo very faintly that, when you're in the pocket, grooves with your drumming. might be tough if you're doing really busy proggy stuff or if you're really worried about timing from an OCD perspective.\n\n3. if you have scratch guitar/bass tracks that were tracked to a click/perfectly gridded drum thing, playing along to that is usually far more inspiring and you can rely less on the click because you can just listen to the instruments.\n\n4. This is where having someone else record you helps. you might be totally in your head about this. a \"producer\" could be like \"bro that take was legit perfect\"",

I've been hesitant to switch click sounds at this point because it kind of... makes sense to me to track to the same click sound that I tracked guitars and vox to?? Different clicks have such a different feel, man... I was taking the time to program accents on the measures before, and I might go back to that and see what happens...

    "content": "To illustrate a good example of the difference and why (guessing) Jon would want to clip rather than do this (which would control the transients as you describe)\n\nIf you use a long look ahead, call it a limiter with a long look ahead. That will let the processor know about the transient well before it hits the GR circuit, thus avoiding distortion/harmonics (of course there still could be some artifacts). But even though there will be samples at the threshold, it won\u2019t be a straight line waveform as if you clipped it. It is pushing the waveform down. The waveform itself is actually changed still, so it is not exact but it\u2019s different than clipping.\n\nA clipper just squares it off. Hence harmonics.\n\nThis is why you can limit/compress an instrument like piano, which has a tendency to hear distortion easily, when clipping it would be a disaster (unless you are going for that)",
