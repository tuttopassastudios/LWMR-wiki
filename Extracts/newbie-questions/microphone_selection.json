The worst one vampired an entire croissant tray before the client showed up and took 5 minutes to set up a mic stand w/ a 57 on it. To echo the others- ask how you can be helpful (and double echo the advice to brush up on basics on your own). I recommend keeping a notebook- shit moves fast and you won't remember everything. Keep tabs on fussy gear (especially if multiple producers or engineers are using the space and aren't as familiar with it). Be a cable-wrapping ninja and know how everyone takes their coffee.",

    "content": "@sloth the reason is use clip gain is so you're not relying on the limiter or compressor to level out the sound. rather, you're using the limiter or compressor for the SOUND it creates. if you want that super compressed sound (or even that lightly compressed sound) of an actual compressor or limiter, you'll often get better results if the signal going into it is evened out a bit. this used to be solved mostly by great mic technique, where a singer would lean back on big notes and whatnot. but these days by using clip gain to even out the sound before it hits your dynamic processing, you can actually more fully lean into the SOUND of the compressor or limiter that comes after it.",

I don't know what the living freak I did wrong, but I didn't notice how horrifying it was until I was deep, deep into this album. After I'm done tracking, I'm gonna go in there and dissect the situation - I don't know if it's the head or just that I tuned in the perfectly horrible spot or if it's the drum itself or the mic placement or what, but as long as I basically turn the EQ of the 7b (that's what it was recorded with) into a beta 52, and then do a sharp dip at 790, it's passable... I absolutely HATE to EQ like this, preferring to be snobby and do it all with the mics, but sometimes, I guess, you gotta do what you gotta do... Will mess around with re-tracking/ putting new heads on and shit after I'm done with these initial takes... I could ramble on... Midwest represent!",

I agree with others that not using any unison pre will make the noise floor lower, but I disagree with them in that I think using the unison pres is a pretty good idea often. \n\nThat said, if you\u2019re struggling with noise, definitely try not compressing on the way in because compressors are only going to raise the noise floor. \n\nOn dynamic mics and ribbon mics, you can decrease your noise floor pretty considerably by picking up a cloudlifter and throwing that in the chain. \n\nIf you do all of the above and still have a high noise floor then either the Apollo is broken (which is pretty unlikely), or your microphone is picking up mechanical noise from your air conditioning, computer fan, refrigerator, etc. if those are the issue, then tackle the issue there. Turn off the A/C, turn off the fridge, turn off the LED lights, etc and see what you hear.",
