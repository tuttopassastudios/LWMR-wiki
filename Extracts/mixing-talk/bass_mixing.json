I did a number on the drums but just couldn't get the low end to sync between the two. I ended up sending the mono bass to two mis-matched outboard compressors. They're totally un-linked and I just matched them by ear and wow... sounds so fucking good. Each one is grabbing and doing it's thing and it's *mostly* adding up to mono but gives real life when things momentarily lean left or right. Reminds me of a drum setup photo today where some of the mics were mis-matched and that's just honest-to-god so OK most of the time.",

Yours sounds huge.\u201d\n\n\nBasically what I did, besides level & panning, was carve out a bunch of like 400 in all harmonic elements. All the tracks sounded good, but the density was all bunched up down in that range. \n\nAs I was explaining it to him, I had a moment of clarity about headroom. Doesn\u2019t matter if all frequencies are present for a big and tall mix, if all the headroom is getting eaten up by everything hitting the same frequencies, the collective volume of that is gonna make everything else feel quieter. \n\nI usually think of headroom in regard to low end and transients, but it\u2019s true for every part of a mix.",

Eric came from tape and he was always cranking the high end on the record side going to tape to account for noise on mix down (easier to tame low end than it is to boost when you're mixing off of tape)... but there was a cool high end sheen that you'd get. So with Saturn, you just separate a high frequency band above what is really audible and just crank the gain on the warm tape setting. Obviously you can adjust to taste, but it's a great way to add a little air & excitement to some dull recordings.",

What\u2019s left in the song do you hear? Then down to 200. Down to 100. Down to 26. What exactly is in the low end information of the mixes you enjoy? I\u2019d then flip it to a high pass and go the other way. How much of the bass is above 1k? The kick? I think it would be eye opening for some. \nShawn Everett once showed me this great mix trick where he low pass something, say a vocal, and slides it all the way down until he can\u2019t hear anything important anymore, and then just switches it from a low pass to a hi pass.

Make quick moves and jump to something else, if the kick is too\u2026.. it will remind you everytime you listen. Try  to step back and listen to your mixes like a ME. Is there too much or not enough of a certain frequency range?  Then dive back into the micro move adjust and move on. This helps  you stay in the flow and to not get lost  in the weeds.  In my experience the music tells you most of what you need to know. Tempo has a huge effect on how the low end can work. Density often determines how midrange and upper mid/ high freq should work.  The elements in the mix should be serving particular roles and that informs where things should sit and ultimately equal how it makes you feel. I don\u2019t think very much when I mix but I react to what\u2019s in front of me . \nThe more you do this the more this will lock in. Another thing that comes to mind, is sometimes if I\u2019m feeling like something isn\u2019t right I\u2019ll do a save as or In your example I\u2019ll mute the kick and duplicate it and start from scratch and see if I can beat it.

When you learn to do it and to hear it, you learn why it's so important (pulling low end plosives out of a vocal so it doesn't pin the compressor, for example). From there you learn how and when to break it (I like boosting the 200hz-ish body of a live snare drum into a parallel compressor/ saturator to solidify and have control of that frequency range, automate it for fills, etc.).\n\nIMO this is a great \"rule,\" which is great to learn and then break all the time.",

I tend to try and find 2-3 instruments/vocals that will occupy the main focus of a given song or section, and just put those faders up and try and get them to sound amazing. Then everything else just gets gradually turned up and processed to fit in with or accentuate those primary parts. I\u2019ll often briefly solo them to high pass and usually subtly low pass, then sneak the fader up and not touch any solos again. Getting a track a little too quiet, and then hunting around with Spectre, an API style EQ, or Sie-Q for a pleasing frequency to accentuate works well for finding a spot in the frequency range. Also I will often aggressively scoop out low mids on sampled/software instruments as I find these almost always have way more weight there than needed in even a minimally dense mix. FX may be added at any point along the line: if I know it\u2019ll be integral to the part I\u2019ll pop \u2018em on a bit while soloing at first, if not I\u2019ll sneak the effect in gradually with everything else playing.

Saturation is a great way of doing this without making things pokey... but might be good to audition with an EQ first to see what zones you should focus in on.

Then sometimes Master Rebalance by Ozone can be a life saver. Especially if say the balance of some instruments are clashing with the vocal or the 808/bass is too loud in relation to everything else. Essentially I\u2019m \u201cunlimiting the beat\u201d. \n\nThen together with the vocal in the mix I\u2019ll try to shape the beat around the vocal with some subtle (usually reductive) eq moves. Something like dynamically sidechaining a bell on the hihat frequencies to the vocal can help a lot. Or I might also play with Spectral Shape. Some people get good results with sidechaining the vocal as a whole with trackspacer or soothe. Then if I\u2019m missing some super lows or excitement I might throw a Pultec/Bax-type EQ or Spectre on it. \n\nSo ultimately I\u2019m creating as much space as possible and give myself enough headroom to still do some typical mixbus moves.\n\nTo me this removes the need to do anything different on the mixbus.

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

    "content": "As a mastering engineer, I\u2019ve kept my monitoring level consistent for the past ten years\u2014at a relatively low volume. This isn\u2019t a rule, just my approach, and I do it because I know exactly how a finished track should sound in my room at that level.\n\nEvery system has a sweet spot, and if you can identify that in your setup, you\u2019ll get more consistent results. This ties into factors like speaker and amp combinations, how your speakers push air\u2014especially in the low end\u2014and how they perform at different volumes.\n\nMany speakers don\u2019t reproduce low frequencies accurately when played too softly. On the flip side, when pushed too hard, speakers often cap the low end, meaning the bass stops getting louder while the mids and highs continue increasing. This is common in everyday listening setups\u2014people crank their systems beyond their limits, causing an imbalance where the top end dominates.\n\nThis is one reason why working with a mastering engineer with a well-calibrated setup can be beneficial. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s only one way to do things\u2014some engineers work in less-than-ideal setups and still get great results. It all comes down to what works for you and gets you the sound you like.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s important to remember which i amsure you already know.... your ears perceive frequencies differently at different volumes\u2014this is a well-documented, non-linear effect. The way we hear balance changes with loudness, which is why understanding how your room and speakers respond at your chosen listening level can make a huge difference in achieving consistent, reliable masters. If you crank it... \"memorize\" in your ears how it should sound cranked. Then when you drop down to another level..\"memorize\" how it sounds there. You should then find a few spots you can use.",

Overall I\u2019d absolutely suggest watching Jon castelli mixing t Shine (he uses clipping well in there ) and mixed by Ali mixing YG , his mix balance and grouping is CHOICE.

I would suggest having the dynamics tamed to your liking before boosting low end in a vocal because it can easily get out of hand\n\nYou could try duplicating the take, use RX de-reverb or whatever you can to remove as much ambience as possible, compress it heavily and blend it in. Obviously compression will bring out ambience so as to not let that become an issue try removing it beforehand. \n\nAVOX duo is a neat trick I use sometimes to help give a vocal some dimension.

    "content": "I think that might be a limiting factor on top of the artists' abilities (Pop Smoke already sounded dope before his setup got professional https://youtu.be/317TP4JOSSE). I've recorded not-so-great rappers through nice chains and mixing wasn't the answer to save a (lacking) source. It never gave you *that* feeling. But even if you are recording great rappers cheaper mics tend to lack body and rarely have \"boostable\" or pleasant top end as you said. So it's a bit complicated before you even get to \"mixing\". Felt that was important to mention so you're not too hard on yourself.\n\nBut assuming that the limiting factor really is just mixing there's a bunch of options. First things first: is your monitoring and listening environment decent? Or are you on headphones? This could make placing vocals even harder for you. \n\nThen do you have a process that starts with vocal cleanup to get rid of or reduce unappealing harshness or performance issues? Despite being simple, people tend to skip basic tools like clip-gain to even out a performance. This should usually also give you some leeway for strategic boosts. Maybe instead of EQ look at harmonics. Fresh Air by Slate is free. Gem Dopamine is nice. Spectre is great. All of these should give you that \"sizzle\" you might be missing.\n\nThen to get the presence and even out the performance you could try some parallel compression with something like an 1176. Also, try out Multiband Compression with the Mcdsp 404 or C6 or whatever you have to control the performance throughout the song once you've got a vocal sound you like.\n\nI also find mixing the 808 & drums together with the vocal the most useful when it comes to gain staging and getting the song to feel right.\n\nObviously, there's more that could be said but I find processes more helpful than tools. It's art at the end of the day. Attached what Serban's assistant sees as their/his \"mixing process\". Mix more and experiment with what you have. Get feedback from the artists.",

I love the way MAAT Santa Cruz does this ever so smoothly. \n2. I compress the bass with a compressor sidechained to a LPF(!), to get some low end body which is usually severely lacking. The LPF is set between 1000-2000 hz, attack 0-8 ms and release 200-400 ms depending on the tempo of the song/bass part. Reducing 3-5 dB on peaks. This gets me really far.\n3. If the bass is a shortscale, I\u2019ll use Goodhertz Tiltshift to move the low mids from around 200 hz to around 100 hz, out of the way of the guitars. \n4. Then I put an amp emulation on the channel. Whichever one floats your boat. Plugin Alliance B15, Guitar Rig, TSE BOD, whatever. I\u2019ll be boosting low end and cutting high end here, or before with a separate instance of Tiltshift. \n5. If I want the bass to sound \u201erock\u201c and cut, I send it to a parallel distortion, which can be anything. I like TSE BOD, which is another sansamp copy which  has a lot of sub. My trick here is to add a clipper before the sansamp to really get extra gnarl. Logic\u2018s stock Bitcrusher works great, but I\u2019m sure anything works.",

I\u2019d calibrate d it nicely to 40 then remembered a spike stent lecture talking about how he changed his underground bass heavy U.K. sound to a more American sound when he made it over to LA.

That\u2019s played on my mind a lot as an Englishman who loves American engineering \u2026..so I thought I\u2019d throw a 200 hz tone into another h/w Vog  and set that up for a kick bump if I want it .

(i'll rewatch when they post it back up)  Its this cutting / scooping of the high mids (up at c.1-6khz) that ive never heard much about before, Im interested because i dont like crushing my mixes to get a higher lufs and if this is an effective way to get their smoothly im v interested in learning more....im happiest with my mixes at -12 lufs but will push to -9 ....but id like to get to -9 with as little sacrifice to the fidelity and low end as poss.\nIve also heard recently (I think i heard it from colin leanord talking) something about the trap guys always scooping out the  second octave harmonic   of the bass ? c. the 110-130hz region....Is anyone familiar with using this? (eg.  the  \"missing fundamental\" and all that good stuff)",

(its confusing). @Eric Martin  Im going to have to hunt some info down re: Lufs weighting and the algorithm to learn how to manipulate this approach i guess",

    "content": "right, there was a spectral shaper on low mids on one of his buses, but then again on the mix bus it was doing the 1-6k.\n\nI think from what I understand that JC is doing he is controlling the attack so it\u2019s consistent, then using the transient shaper to make sure it\u2019s the same for every hit. It is smart, and for his workflow it\u2019s also fast and easy.\n\nI use compressors a lot, but I\u2019m also working in mostly indie rock with acoustic drums and bass guitars not 808\u2019s and drum machines, which is a drastically different world. I also think I\u2019m doing what most people don\u2019t do and I don\u2019t always love the artifacts of compression so I generally use slow attacks to maintain transients and fast releases to recover quickly (I adjust so that I get the fastest release before audible distortion)\n\nBTW Bruce Swedien while he may have evangelized not using compression don\u2019t underestimate that his greatest works were done to tape and even when you were conservative and didn\u2019t hit tape hard, the transformers going into tape and out of and the tape as a medium itself would peak limit attack heavy instruments like drums",

This realisation led me into learning about phase rotation and all pass filters this year......im still deep diving phase since christmas lol \n\nI\u2019d defo recommend SSl X-phase plug in to anyone ITB \n\nWhat you say about tape is interesting to me because.....\n\ni wonder if the \"to tape sound\" will soon be a thing of the past even as an  aesthetic.....the artists in my genre, here in london and i know its the same in the states......their new forward looking aesthetic is this ruined/ultra smashed/clipped 808 , hi-passed percussion , serum synths and a  filtered vocal sound....ts like distorted nintendo on acid .....lol i actually like doing tracks like that for the madness of it....but magnetic flux and tape hysterisis are a v distant memory at that point me thinks......",

    "content": "@Gazing Wrmth | Mixes & Masters I\u2019m pretty much exclusively in cans and i second all of what Noah said. Additionally, sonarworks for your headphones is definitely worth it esp. for only 70 USD. It will smear transients a bit, but you can get over that if you reference well. Mix quiet and you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nForgot to mention, because DT 770s are closed back, making sure you have a good seal and taking breaks are critical. You need a 15 minute break for every hour you put in on cans, bare minimum IMO. Without that, attention loss and fatigue kick in. \n\nTools like tonal balance control 2 are important. I recommend setting up a Pro-MB with 3-5 bands across the entire frequency range but make them all neutral with no compression. Sub, low, mid, high mid, top end. You can monitor specific ranges now. And for sub/low end, you can turn the gain up on your headphone mix a bit, isolate the low end, and you can hear it a bit better. Make sure you turn your headphones down a bit before you un-solo the low or the sub, but this has helped me massively",

Or if the other instruments are doing things that aren\u2019t meaningful to the arrangement, it can get contribute to bass notes getting lost as well. \nTry muting other stuff one at a time until you can hear the bass well, and evaluate why the bass isn\u2019t cutting through. \n\nSometimes, you just gotta zoom out and mute the bass and mix the song without the bass and put it in. Before you do this, save as and solo vocals (if there is any) bass and drums (sometimes one other most important/prominent element in the arrangement on top of that) and make that work first. You can get it to a point of making the mix work this way if there is one element that just doesn\u2019t sit well in the mix.",

Using a multiband volume shaper like this you can have the low end transient trigger an adsr just for the high end so you can get the bleed under control while letting the natural decay of the floor tom through across the downbeat where the ride/crash is",

Izotope insight has a very good spectrograph that clearly reveals what\u2019s happening down at 20-30 hz and how much energy is there . We ve also discussed izotope tonal balance here as well , but it\u2019s really a very handy diagnostic when used to investigate where your low end energy is against a referenced track you like . Izotope Match eq is another tool that again allows you to compare and contrast what\u2019s happening in your low end . I\u2019ve also found the Shawn Everett trick mentioned here , useful for investigating low end (put a brick wall low pass filter on your mixbus and sweep it down to the 20-30hz with your subs on and see what that actually sounds and feels like . The other thing I find helpful is my gain staging and buses are set up so that I know how much gr and level should be arriving at each bus , so you soon know if you\u2019re too hot just by looking at the comp / limiter . The last thing I\u2019d say is know your speakers . I apply all this to myself because translation is my main point of focus right now . I forget where I heard it said , but I heard it said that the listener hears the inverse of what we the mixers hear .",

So other things need to be done like parameter automation and layering\n\nBass guitar is probably not gonna have as consistent in your face subs like 808s, but the life of it always felt more massive than 808 to me. \n\nSoft synths sound huge on their own because they have very consistent presence but when you turn the faders down for balance, it gets smaller again. So  as many mentioned it takes making it smaller to make it bigger again. I guess this also applies to distorted guitars",

I guess I could try limiting drums/bass together, as maybe it\u2019s a phase issue with kick and bass adding together (talking live drums here, not programmed)\u2026 but any thoughts here are appreciated. \n\nSecondly, what range of limiting (aka -2 to -6db) are you guys doing on mix bus to have your overall mix at around-9lufs? I have been trying to only hit -2db of limiting on peaks for most of my mix, but have a really tough time accomplishing this and loudness. I love heavy/punchy low end, so maybe that\u2019s why.. \n\nI guess I have this idea/goal in mind that I should be able to make -9lufs mixes that are punchy with a lot of low end, while only hitting 2db of limiting, but it seems impossible.

The VU meter to highlight how the mix is behaving pre-limiter :\nVU (Volume Unit) Meters essentially display an average of what we hear, rather than the very fast peaks that we don\u2019t. they will show you the energy in the low end, and if there is radical movement, then you probably have an issue with frequencies that you aren\u2019t hearing.VU meters should \u201cdance\u201d smoothly and in a gentle manner, usually in time with the music, rather than in big jumps and erratic, out of time movement.\u00a0 This erratic movement implies that there are drastic level changes, which will be hard to control in mastering and need addressing in the mix.  \n\n2. The LUFS meter post limiter to set your loudness levels\n\nPersonally, i dont use this MO ...i like izotope tonal balance to monitor the mix but....just wanted to share what i rememmbered about people using vu ITB",

    "content": "I use an Analog VU meter on the output of my monitor controller built by the inhouse tech who also worked at Neve (he designed and built the 8816 summing box) - he recommended the Sifam ones because their ballistics are really good - which I think is the main argument for analog vs digital. I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

    "content": "I don't do a ton of referencing while mixing anymore but it definitely was and still is a key for learning new things.\n\nI mostly work with young indie artists and producers who are still finding their sound and it's very common for me to get notes like \"can we make the guitar solo sound like XYZ song from ABC artist,\" and usually after a little bit of frustration I work my way through to a new trick up my sleeve by dissecting a sound and trying to recreate it.\n\nI think the major pitfall to avoid though for mixers and producers just at the beginning is understanding that you can't squeeze blood from a stone - not getting discouraged or into the pit of despair if your bedroom produced track with amp sims and samples isn't standing up against the big budget Studio A level records.  But that doesn't mean you can't start learning what a great bass tone is in a mix and why it's working by listening to those intently.",

    "content": "So think of mid vs side in terms of panning left right & center, and think of EQ as volume. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got a lot of low end information on the sides, and say it\u2019s fighting with a mono bass track that\u2019s supposed to be holding down the majority of the low end, you can eq the lows out of those panned tracks, or you can blanket turn all the lows down on the sides with a m/s eq on a buss, so that the L and R info is quieter. It\u2019s basically a group volume ride for frequencies instead of tracks. You can also do this on individual stereo tracks if just panning isn\u2019t granular enough. \n\nThe why & when is mostly about taste. I tend to mix into a proQ3 setting that has the sides hi passed around 100 for the same reason I have a pultec boosting highs & lows on the master- it just ends up doing a lot of work for me.\n\nIt can become problematic if I\u2019ve got big toms in a song and, after I\u2019ve got a mix starting to cook I\u2019ll toggle it on & off to see if I\u2019m doing more harm than good. For the kind of music I mostly do, it works more often than not, but the one song I sent to Cian for mixing he basically blasted me for doing that. (In his own kind and gentle way.)\n\nBut m/s eq isn\u2019t just for the master buss. You can think about it for any stereo track. Sometimes, I have an acoustic that\u2019s carrying the whole song, but the fundamentals are fighting with the vocal, so I\u2019ll turn the mid down at that frequency (or side chain that to the vocal if it feels anemic when the vocal is out.) that leaves the sides as big as you like cause it\u2019s not fighting with my mono vocal.",

    "content": "Great, we\u2019ve all kind of known that. Back to FFT, which works in a LINEAR  way. If we run a 16 \u201cband\u201d FFT on a 48 kHz signal it will divide the audio spectrum (0 Hz to 24 kHz) into 16 evenly spaced bins or bands. Each bin is 1500 Hz wide. Think about that for a second. That means we have a a single bin that contains everything from 16500 to 18000 Hz, a very \u201cnarrow\u201d slice as it pertains to musical interest. On the flip side we are left with only a single bin that represents everything from 0 Hz to 1500 Hz, a huge chunk of the music. If the whole point was to slice up this signal so we could do something interesting to it then that is often not the resolution we hoped for. \n\nI see the hands going up!! \u201cLet\u2019s just increase the number of bands to get more frequency resolution\u201d. And herein lies one of the confounding things about FFT. We are caught in a frequency domain/time domain tradeoff. The finer the bands or slices the more things blur in the time domain when we reconstitute via the iFFT (of the bands we have processed any or all bands). If no processing then you can run any length FFT and then the iFFT and perfectly reconstruct the original signal. (This is what you\u2019ll often see 16 to 48k FFT on signal meters).\n\nSo some practical examples to help you guys get a handle on this. Open a file in RX and get the spectral repair module in attenuate mode set to a strength of 1. Set bands to the lowest possible (128?), figure out how wide your bins are. Now try to do a detailed edit in the low end, you\u2019ll notice that you don\u2019t have much \u201cresolution\u201d, but up high say above 10k it\u2019s razor sharp. Now bump up your bands to the max 4096. Do the same LF edit and you\u2019ll suddenly have nice narrow frequency slices but you\u2019ll see things getting very blurry in the time domain, tight kicks become smeary whooshes",

Whenever I high pass my vocals (especially past 100hz) I start to hear some weird phase type of effect\u2026 idk what it is but I hate it. But when I don\u2019t high pass my vocals past 100-120 hz, my vocals sounds too boomy, like the low end of my vocals is too overpowering the mix when I play it in my car\u2026. Is there a way I can go around this?\n\n2. Other than delay throws, When people put a constant delay on vocals it seems like they want the delay to be felt not heard\u2026.. if this is the case, how does the delay not being heard help the mix\u2026.? Or am I just thinking too deep into it?\nThanks in advance",

    "content": "1) I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about. For me, a couple things have helped \n\n- try shelving the lows rather than use a HPF. I\u2019ll even cascade a couple of shelves sometimes if I have to go crazy, or shelve 150 and HP 50. You can get similar amounts of attenuation and the shape of the phase rotation feels a little less fake.\n\n- how much of this are you doing in solo? Often the phase fuckery bothers me in solo and doesn\u2019t as soon as the 808 is bumping. \n\n- sometimes I just let the lowend be loose and say \u201cfuck it. My mix, my aesthetic choice\u201d. Seems like not many agree but I like lowend in my vocal.",

It does a cool \u201csomething\u201d on bass guitar in a metal/rock context for me that in particular helps on smaller speakers, but also helps to fill out space where some notes are naturally stronger than others. It helps me avoid a lot of tedious automation and multiband babysitting in addition to providing somewhat of a rock solid \u201cconcrete slab\u201d consistent low end. I always loved what Rbass did but the effect vanishes a little when the progression of the song moves to a different note - automating the frequency in question (super low, where A = 55hz) solves that problem for me but is a chore to do.",

    "content": "i've dealt with this a fair amount, but never thought to mention it here. For better or worse, I often end up with pretty air-tight first passes on the gainstaiging front. So sometimes, when a mix note is as simple as \"turn up 808\", the rest of the mix changes for obvious reasons. I'm hitting my multiband different, hitting my clipper different, hitting my limiter different; so if I were to simply execute that note, now the vocal, guitar, pretty much everything shifts a good bit in energy and I then spend time making the mix work again now that a big chunk of energy got pushed up in it. (side note - I like to mix a bit more gentle/tight on the low-end side since the lows are so hot in car systems, headphones, entertainment centers, etc. these days. Midrange is my home base.) Curious what your experiences have been with this sort of thing, and/or if you have recommendations.",

When the kick is fed to a compressor on your 808 channel - the compressor \u201clistens\u201d to the kick and applies the compression curve from the kick onto the bass.\n\nSo in your case of printing stems with a mix bus compressor - you want the SPL Iron plugin to \u201clisten\u201d to the entire mix as it heard it before but then apply that compression to one track at a time.\n\nWe can do this in Ableton with some clever workarounds, which would be a lot more efficient to show you on a video call on the server if you are free later.  Essentially you need to print a version of your song at each point in your mix bus chain where there are dynamics plugins (just before the Slate plugin, just before the Iron Compressor but after all the other plugins) and then send that audio to those corresponding plugins\u2019 external sidechain inputs and then you can use the \u201cinclude return and master effects\u201d and get the result you are looking for",

For whatever reason the volume balance I was doing on them before a single bit of processing was better than any mix I had done lately. \n\nSo\u2026 relook at my room acoustics? The thing is though they sounded great when I threw them up on the system, as I wanted, no big surprises, just sounded way better than on the headphones. \n\nI found the really exaggerated lows made setting the kick and bass much easier, and the sizzly  top meant I was really sensitive to it and was drawn to address sounds that were a bit harsh. \n\nIt\u2019a a bit like the inverse of working on NS10s.

Then I drive it through the free TSC 808 plugin for further emphasize the harmonics the bluey brings out. (EQ too)\n- Then, I use Audreio on the master to play the mix through my phone instead of my monitors. Once on the phone, you can blend the parallel with the bass in a way where there\u2019s little to no audible difference on a monitor, but the illusion of a bass can be heard through the harmonics playing on the phone.\n- It\u2019s a balancing act, but there\u2019s almost always a nice sweet spot to be found where it doesn\u2019t change the quality of the sound enough to be intrusively perceived on HD speakers, while giving life to the bass on lesser speakers.\n\nThis has helped my bass translate to more systems, and is the only time I find myself wanting to use the CLA76.",

So yeah I\u2019d first try pumping low end into it, be it with EQ or subharmonic, followed by some (a lot) of compression. I\u2019m sure better people here have a better way to do this. \n\nThe DI itself doesn\u2019t have any overtones other than stuff you\u2019re finding unflattering, so you could try mult\u2019ing the DI signal out to an amp sim (even some guitar amps work here) to fill out the spectrum that the guitars aren\u2019t fulfilling \n\nI\u2019d also say the bass drum could use some augmenting of the low end  and maybe a bit of length in order to emphasise that impact. Because the synth bass atm has all the power, and isn\u2019t omnipresent, so it\u2019s leaving the rest of the arrangement even _more_ neutered as a result",

As I said, a lot is about simple volume shaping, but that doesn\u2019t always give me what I\u2019m after. For example, how that octave layer trick translates to kicks. If I have a kick that I want to feel snappier on top, could I duplicate it and pitch it up an octave, or would that mess with the mid/low end? Or is it more about lifting the top with EQ to bring the transient forward? That always feels a bit strange when it\u2019s pushed too hard, so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right approach either. Just curious how pro mix engineers handle it.",

Low end is fine (everything non-kick is high-passed), but the top end is where my kick transient sometimes gets masked by loops/percs. That\u2019s why I mentioned the tiny time-offset thing, not big shifts, just few ms to see if it helps the transient poke through without messing up the groove @thegreatcarsoni. Not sure if that\u2019s considered bad practice, but sometimes it feels like it helps.",

    "content": "Have a bit of situation here that I\u2019m not sure how to navigate on a song where I am producing and mixing\n\nCurrently on mix 51 of a song (which is not a problem in and of itself) and suddenly the artist says \u201cI want everything under 150hz mono bc a famous EDM producer said so\u201d \n\nMind you the song is not EDM in any way shape or form also the feedback seems to be purely based on visual information he gets from some sort of stereo analyzer not something that actually bothers him when listening\n\nNow the mix/production was not built in any way to be mono sub 150hz so there\u2019s quite a bit more information there than on a typical EDM bc I tend not to surgically remove everything sub 100-150hz. So you get some of that in the keys, synths, guitars etc\n\nI know it\u2019s \u201cflip the burger\u201d etc but I was wondering if y\u2019all had any advice on how to approach this\n\nDon\u2019t wanna argue with the artist ofc but just going and removing everything sub 150 seems like not a great idea so I figured might focus only on the bass instruments (which is really just an electric bass with a lot of low end) and try to make that as mono as possible\n\nAny other advice?",

I'm running into some issues at the moment with my mixes being too dark. I've spent a lot of time learning to control how much low end I have but mine still ends up being a bit big in comparison to my references... Another thing i'm struggling with is whenever I listen to mixes that  I find exciting theres always this SMOOTH upper mid range that I cant seem to achieve without making things harsh but somehow still dull by comparison. So I just feel like i'm going round in circles doing Heapssss of revisions for clients and never quite getting things where I want them.",
