I\u2019m taken aback daily on Gearspace and theGearPage how people with absolutely no real world experience wax poetic about the quality of this piece of gear over that piece, and how quickly every thread devolves into nothing useful. On this discord experts and beginners alike are constantly giving and receiving real knowledge that actually helps make records, rather than \u201cwhich plugin gives the LUFS\u201d. I\u2019ve been at this music thing a long time and nearly every single day I learn something new and useful to apply to my next session. \n\nIf someone really came onto this forum and found the heat of this particular kitchen too hot for them, I imagine life might continue to be hard for them. This is about as good as it gets, and if there\u2019s a place giving out better info from better people I\u2019d love to hear about it. What @oaklandmatt has curated is pretty special.

I\u2019m really close now, just dialing in the eq curve little by little.  I found a plugin called Bertom EQ analyser really useful to visualise what the Fat Bustard and Elysia EQs were doing at my usual spots. Most surprising was the gentle saturation, which i think i\u2019ve tweaked using the gentle tube preset on Saturn. The cool thing about the Fat Bustard is that it seems to pull the side up a touch even when not using the widener. I replicated that using BX EQ 3. 3 plugins to replace a few grand\u2019s worth of gear.",

I was treated to a bit of a real life MWTM with Chris Coady last night (super kind guy) and he was showing me this plugin to mix a big pop vocal sound. He duplicated the lead vocal twice to have three tracks and had this plugin as the first insert on each track, split into three bands for each channel, low vocal, mid vocal, high end vocal. The plugin auto syncs the band settings in all instances whenever you adjust a band. He was saying Serban uses this plugin and does that exact thing on some songs. After treating each track with some eq/comp/saturation the vocal sounded really big but balanced. And it\u2019s like $60 so I think I\u2019m going to have to grab it. Probably could do this with other plugins but I appreciated the auto-syncing function and also didn\u2019t notice any weird phase issues which you could maybe run into trying to create the bands by hand?",

Sometimes this is the right move, but if I start tweaking the compressor in the 2nd plugin slot that's downstream of 8 more plugins that's a good way to de-stabilize the entire sound you've built up. Committing sooner prevents me from unraveling too much of the audio.",

I'll keep you guys updated and hit me if you'd find it useful. (hoping to throw in a couple other features - inverted in/out trims for \"density\" control, auto gain matching, maybe even a cheeky mix knob that would probably result in a fun flanging effect).",

Clearly there's been an evolution to things coming in more fully baked, but recently I had a whole record where the sessions came in fully baked. They sounded very good, were incredibly intricate in how they were layered, and the bus processing was such a massive part of the sound that anytime I tried to build up something my own way, it wasn't even in the same ballpark. I ended up buying every plugin on the clients master bus and 'resigned' myself to small tweaks. I totally changed my approach and it became incredibly liberating... to know that something is already so close to being finished, but spending my time throughtfully making small changes that amounted to a 10-15% gain.",

Could have and should have taken up a member here on a generous mic lending offer (you know who you are \ud83d\ude4f ), but decided I could roll with my own gear. Acoustic gtr and vocal, tracked together\u2014would have done the two figure 8 mics/use the nulls move with the borrowed mics, but I don't have two fig 8 mics right now. A drive across town would have gotten me the right tools for the job and made everything smooth and easy. Lesson learned: get the right shit no matter what!\n\nArtist left in good spirits, job done, fine. But I was super bummed, I had wanted to blow them away. Had to step away for a few days, and then spent most of yesterday trying every trick in my book to get the phase of the vocal and gtr mic to be happy (it sounded fine so long as the artist wasn't singing loud\u2014then it became phase city in a few loud passages as the gtr mic got more and more vocal). Time adjuster, playing with Little Labs IBP, EQ, whatever. Still mostly a huge bummer. But! Auto-Align 2 did some spectral phase shift magic that I don't think I would have been able to suss out on my own\u2014holy shit, what a relief! Maybe I love our new AI overlords after all.

They have a great intuition for voicing parameters and their curves in a way that is highly musical and hard to go wrong with.

To go one step further on the controls for a beginner- If you are using eq, that implies that you have already diagnosed a problem, which you'll be solving with eq. When you think of that problem, what words do you use? (i.e., this is way too dark, this needs a little more highs, that frequency hurts, etc.). \nIf you find yourself talking about broader things like \"highs\" or \"lows\", that probably indicates a wide Q is appropriate. If you find yourself talking about \"that ringing\" or \"the fundamental\", that probably indicates a narrow Q is appropriate. \n\nFrequency, Bandwidth (Q), and Gain are all balance elements, as eq is a tool for balancing frequencies with one another. I'd avoid using the key of the song or phase when considering eq choices as a beginner. Just train and trust your ears.\n\nA tool that can be helpful in training your ears for EQ usage is \"Blindfold EQ\" by Audiothing (https://www.audiothing.net/effects/blindfold-eq/), which is a free EQ plugin with no numbers or indicators for the controls.",

I just had a quick peek at the session and this might have been the last project with my hardware mix bus (UTA MPEQ -> OG UnFairchild V1). Everything came from Ryan very well cooked with his analog futzery and UAD stuff, so lots of coralling with EQ on my end... not much added compression. Looks like the guitar solo went through my old Federal 864 compressor -- which is wild, that thing works on something every 6 months maybe. Some drums went through my old SansAmp pedal. Lots of the guitars got squeezed with my Scully 280s. The whole album has the vocals going through my BG2 -- although this one has some snippets that were ITB... Ryan was constantly tweaking the production throughout the mix process, hence the many versions. A fun collaborative process with a record I still get excited to listen to.",

    "content": "A+ advice above. Few small things I'd add:\n\n1. Don't be overly concerned by what you see on the screen. A certain style on a compressor that says \"clean\" may not actually be. It may have more harmonics than various other styles on the same plugin. Certain meters move faster than others, not all 10ms attack times will actually attack the same, certain GUIs that imply some sort of analog modeling may not actually do so, etc. Just listen and trust your ears.\n\n2. If you can't hear certain aspects right away, that's fine too. You can't force it, don't rush it. Still just listen and trust your ears.\n\n3. I liked compression less when my monitoring was lousy and not suitably dynamic, because everything sounded more compressed than it actually was.",

Use some sort of match eq/plugin doctor/etc to figure out the eq curve of the tape plug with your settings and replicate that with regular eq and then compare. On the buss I often really just wanted the eq and not the actual \u201ctape\u201d stuff when I\u2019ve done this and compared the two or lived with the eq curve and then tried to go back to the tape plug.",

I can easily enable/disable the automation if I want to A/B or simplify while solving another problem.\n\n3.

This lets you place the instrument in the stereo field of the reverb. Doing it with mondo mod allows you to keep it static but also automate movement (small or large) within the verb \ud83d\ude42\n\nAnother idea:\nUse Waves StudioVerse (or similar plugin that allows this routing)\n-parallel split the dry/wet \n-wet gets what ever verb you want\n-Leave the wet panned out-wide\n-pan the dry in towards the middle \n\nDoing it with StudioVerse allows you to avoid making aux-sends and keep it all on the track level. (Very useful on bgvs)\n\nLast idea:\nUse a pan control plugin (S1, TrackControl, etc) after the verb so you can make it more mono if you want. \n\nI love verb/dly haha thanks for letting me talk  about it here\u2026my wife is tired of hearing about it \ud83e\udd72",

You can do this from your Mix Window by selecting all busses/auxes you want to print, right-click, choose \"Create Track\", and now those Busses/Auxes will show up in your Arrange Window. Do this for any and all effects, parallel busses, etc etc\n\n2. ignore step 2\n\n3. Turn on your Cycle range you want to export (yellow bar across the top like Marv said) and select all tracks you want to export\n\n4. File --> Export --> All Tracks as Audio Files\n\n5. If next dialog box doesn't have options showing, smash that Options Button and choose various options\n  a. Range: Export Cycle Range Only\n  b. Uncheck \"Bypass Effects Plug-ins\" if you want their processing\n  b. Include Audio Tail and Include Volume/Pan Automation selected\n  c. Normalize Off\n\n6. I suggest making an AES-Standardly-named New Folder and exporting into that \n\n7. Export that bad boy\n\nThis will ensure you can import into your Industry Standard DAW exactly where they left off, minus the mix bus processing. \n\nIf they're sharing effects (e.g. guitar and vocal both going to a verb), and you want them both wet but also separate, then they'll need bounce those separately or dup the verb send/return (in which case their Valhalla Vintage Verb will be 12dB too loud b/c they'll forget to turn off their 2bus processing when they bounce it separately)",

Exactly the kind of tool I love using for mixing. \n\nVery thankful for plugin devs out there who are creating tools that make mixing fun and aren\u2019t just creating yet another SSL or 1176.",

I'll sometimes double the same octave or do an octave below.  It's usually way down in the mix but for me it usually gets me where I want to be much faster than trying a plugin, although the only subsynth generator I have is the Brainworx one which is kind of hit or miss for me.  If anyone has a good rec for a subsynth plug I'd love to hear!\n\nEdit: I think this comes in especially handy if you get a track with effects like chorus/phaser/flanger on a subby synth and your subs are shifting everywhere level wise from note to note",

But that's also because it's not trying to be the best mixing platform. It does a *lot* of things that make it preferable from a writing/arranging perspective, and that far outweighs the cons.\n\nI wish it had EUCON support, because it's hard to get hi-res fader rides from controllers without it. Best I can do is do rides with MIDI values (only 128 values). My solution to this has been to map a MIDI fader to a *Utility* gain plugin and limit the range of the fader move to +/- 6dB so that I can get a good resolution with it across the range of volumes that I want to automate. But that's a pain in the ass.\n\nThat said, there's one feature of Ableton that I really miss when I use other DAW's and that's the *Audio Effect Rack* device. I use these *all* the time for so many things like parallel processing, or quickly disabling entire FX chains. They are incredibly useful and they remove the need to mult-out three extra channels to do parallel FX (like you would in Pro Tools).",

Sometimes I feel that what I like is that those patches are a little bit over the top but I never bother to edit them because it\u2019s a PITA to do. Maybe with plugins we have too many opportunities to tweak em to \u201cblend\u201d in the mix when the opposite might be better.\n\nHere are a few things I like to do with vocal FX:\n- Chorus / Doubler that I then distort and will boost some high mid frequency (spectre is great for that)\n- mono slap back is underrated, can be very appropriate in modern mixes\n- Mentioned many times but compressing / distorting / EQing reverb returns (side chaining the compressor in the return with the dry vocal as key can really make vocal reverb bloom)\n- Also, I don\u2019t always tempo sync my delays, sometimes 300ms just works \n-",

Not every producer is able to switch hats and approach their sounds the way I do (though of course some can).

It may sound like too much when the verb return is loud but when you sink the verb down it usually is really effective for me.\n\nI like to use a mono aux with a delay plug-in for predelays, with a bus as the input and a bus to the verb as the output. No predelay on the verb itself, you make it before hand on this aux. Reason for this being you have a lot of control on your send signal that only the verb hears. A midrangey verb and a full range dry vocal make for depth and texture that can peacefully co exist. You can de ess the send harder than the real LV. With this pre delay aux you can make the send signal darker or brighter. If the song calls for it, make a second aux and have multiple predelays feeding the same verb. For example, a 16th with no feedback that is 80% wet, and a second input bus to same output bus that is dark 1/4 note 100% wet and with feedback where you can automate the send to that long feedback predelay and leave the short no feedback 1/16 static. You can get a lot of mileage out of the same verb with these multiple pre delays and provide some cohesive varied space.",

For example, double tracking guitars, keep the same guitar cab and guitar but different amp head. Or different pickups from the same entire rig. Etc. \n\nThere have been a lot of good tips for layering vocals, to have the harmonies be different mics and preamps or simply stepping away from the mic to get more distance. \n\nAs far as plugins and stereoizing, even a simple pitch shift plugin can do a lot. Delay 15-30ms each side, pitch +/- 5-10 cents, can get a cool effect if used subtly",

These three are always open on a second screen to my side. I have Tonal Balance set to the Fine mode, with the Modern curve preset, and with 5 second averaging instead of the default 10. I mostly just check it once I have a mix pretty much put together to see if I\u2019m missing anything as a dummy check, but I\u2019ll also look at it when comparing to a ref or playing with kick/bass levels. Sometimes it\u2019s also helpful to find a spot for a final element or two I\u2019m trying to shoehorn into a dense arrangement\u2014but for that I usually just pull up Spectre and push frequencies around until things sound good. (The instance of Pro-Q3 is for seeing more fine detail, and Insjght I\u2019m just using to measure loudness.)",

Then I use sends (or you can multi-output) to respective audio tracks and name them (you can also include Instrumental, TV Mix and A Cappella as their own audio tracks). Record-enable all the audio tracks, record them down. Then use Soundflow to copy the mix buss plugins you need (Copy Track Data macro), copy them to all the audio tracks, then use Track Bounce to offline bounce all of the stems in one go, and it will include the plugins. Takes about 10-15min.\n\nThe only caveat with this is that you have to route any effects to the same aux, like Lead Vocal Verb has to go to Lead Vocal Aux and nowhere else, so you can\u2019t share effects.

The warmth slider that makes a sound feel warmer or cooler is super fun to me. It's not transparent, but the limiting is gentler, so I like it guiding a sound into its place. Its goal is to make the overall artifacts of limiting more pleasing\n2) I find it faster, more versatile, and better for limiting than a Vari-Mu emulation. Not to mention the UI is way more helpful than what I'm used to with a plugin looking to remind us of a Fairchild or similar\n3) Yes, it just doesn't brickwall, and it has a vibe\n4) You don't Need Tupe if you have a saturator you already like, but I adore it. I was skeptical at first, but I demoed it on drums, and it changed my life. Always on drums and bass guitar for me. Again, Goodhertz's UI makes it more versatile than any other Tube and/or Tape emulator I've seen. It has a million options to tailor the saturation. The Opto Compressor and simple EQ are fast and versatile. It sounds good",

An example might be Goodhertz, which you may have installed once before as a trial or part of a bigger pack, but not authorized yet or the trial ran out. All DAWs will load the session with presumably no problems, but it's not until you manually open the insert itself that you realize the plugin has been operating in bypass the entire time. Waves even does a version of this now too, but it's active with 15-30sec intervals of silence. Multiply this with basically every plugin manufacturer and it becomes a very complex matrix. Furthermore, some plugins aren't as backwards compatible as they should be or different computer architectures impact settings carrying over. AutoTune (the bane of my existence) for a long time would flip settings if you went from a silicon Mac to an Intel Mac, but not vice-versa. Too many gremlins to account for to be fully reliant on their session as-is, but of course it happens. nature of the beast.",

These plugins were supposed to add \"vibe\" and \"mojo\" and \"that sound.\" \n\nSome of these plugins are indeed great, but the hyperbole use to describe them distracted me from learning about compression as a tool to solve a problem. These standard controls, like attack/release times, are the key to making the tool effective. \n\nOnce you understand the mechanical stuff a bit, the esoteric \"vibe machine\" plugins become even more fun. Like, you're telling me your new favorite compressor looks like a soviet radio and only has one knob labelled \"BLAST?\" Well now your trained ear can hear that the BLAST knob shortens the attack time as you turn it and that's why it pulverizes the leading edge of your sounds. You knew you liked the sound of it before, and that gut feeling is valuable, but now you know you can use this fictional soviet radio compressor plugin anytime you identify a problem that can solved by fast attack compression. Brain meet gut.\n\nYou also know that if you're in a situation without your new favorite fictional soviet radio compressor plugin, you can likely achieve similar results using a different compressor. All is not lost and you live to work another day.",

Another thing I'd try if you have it is soothe2 if you can get it to mostly work on that resonance without killing the tone (even maybe these both in combination) and then finally I'd try something like Saturn or Kclip in multiband and try and use a combination of dynamics and saturation within that band to tame it further.  If it's really bad maybe a combination of those 3, or just automating an EQ but that sounds grueling and time consuming if it's throughout the entire performance.  Maybe Surfer EQ could also accomplish this but I don't have that plug.  I also think there's a Surfer EQ type function in Nectar or Neutron?  Somebody that knows Izotope's stuff better than me can probably chime in.\n\nMy 2 cents and probably there are some better solutions out there but this is where I'd start personally!",

This allows the limiter to examine the incoming audio in advance and predict the amount of gain reduction needed to meet the requested output level. If the look-ahead time is very short, the limiter doesn't have much time to move to the desired level: this will generally have the effect of preserving transients better and increasing the apparent loudness, but at the expense of possible distortion. Longer look-ahead times are safer, but less loud, and transients might appear to get lost in the mix a little more.\u201d",

I\u2019m also using the Klanghelm VU meter in RMS mode.  One other thing i\u2019ve found really useful lately when mixing albums is using Izotope\u2019s Tonal Balance plug to get a quick visual of the curve of the first few mixes after which I make preset based in those and use it as a quick ref when mixing the rest of the tracks.

They're aiming for the same target (emulate an analog 1176), but they were both built by different teams, and thus there will be variations that keep them from nulling, even if they're designed to do the same thing.\n\nThat said, I don't hear any appreciable difference between the two OTTs. For me it comes down to the Xfer Records plugin having  a more intuitive set of controls, so it's got my vote. \ud83d\ude42",

    "content": "1. Corrective EQ in the Upper midrange/high end, notching out all the harsh resonances, taming the pick transients if the bass is played with a pick. I love the way MAAT Santa Cruz does this ever so smoothly. \n2. I compress the bass with a compressor sidechained to a LPF(!), to get some low end body which is usually severely lacking. The LPF is set between 1000-2000 hz, attack 0-8 ms and release 200-400 ms depending on the tempo of the song/bass part. Reducing 3-5 dB on peaks. This gets me really far.\n3. If the bass is a shortscale, I\u2019ll use Goodhertz Tiltshift to move the low mids from around 200 hz to around 100 hz, out of the way of the guitars. \n4. Then I put an amp emulation on the channel. Whichever one floats your boat. Plugin Alliance B15, Guitar Rig, TSE BOD, whatever. I\u2019ll be boosting low end and cutting high end here, or before with a separate instance of Tiltshift. \n5. If I want the bass to sound \u201erock\u201c and cut, I send it to a parallel distortion, which can be anything. I like TSE BOD, which is another sansamp copy which  has a lot of sub. My trick here is to add a clipper before the sansamp to really get extra gnarl. Logic\u2018s stock Bitcrusher works great, but I\u2019m sure anything works.",

In my experience and after much testing, I have found that buffer size makes NO DIFFERENCE in h/w insert latency (at least with my Apollo interfaces, could be different with others but not sure why). Also, I had my HW latency dialed perfectly for each sample rate I use but since the second to last PT update (the one before integrated Melodyne), I have found that pro tools now calculates automatically and if I leave all HW latency at 0.0 in my playback engine, I get perfect null). Also! I have found that one thing that totally affects the number of delay is the settings of my interface, there are a bunch of settings within the Apollo\u2019s (dsp load lock, UAD engine delay comp\u2026) that will affect the latency.

I think it is cool, especially in the age of \u201chalf the jobs are gonna be gone soon\u201d- something like audio engineering can be a cool career path for young people to explore. \n\nAbout endorsements, just like how young athletes look up to sports stars - maybe some form of that is needed for young people to have some dream figures to look up to. Many people have said the marketing gloating illusive glamour and heroism in the audio world aren\u2019t providing  a good guidance to people starting out, and I think it can be better for sure. I\u2019ve been liking the panel talk MWTM has been doing in AES and NAMM, where they are discussing a lot of stuff that really matters. Stuff beyond turning knobs, discussing about what makes great records/record makers - I\u2019ve learned a lot just showing up to those panels at AES and not doing anything else during the event. I feel like if bigger plugin companies do what Ableton does for their marketing (Loop, Livestream), I think it would be so much cooler and useful.",

I have a couple thoughts on this.\n1) what sounds super grindy solo\u2019d often sounds great in the mix. It\u2019s one of those things that is counterintuitive but true. \n2) the bass + strings + performance is going to have the absolute biggest impact on tone. \n3) if you\u2019re a UAD user, their B15, dbx 160 & neve 2254 usually gets me a long way towards a tone I like. \n4) I\u2019m still learning what tones I like, but I have a passive J Bass with flats, and a P Bass with rounds and between those two basses I cover a lot of ground. \n\nI can send you examples if you want, just hit me in the DMs.",

To the point I actually assumed it was just glitching and the dial didn\u2019t work. \n\nMoving to a better monitoring environment coincided with a pro tools update where touching any of the Ruby controls during playback causes errors and stops playback, so since then when I\u2019ve used Ruby I just flip it on fairly early on in the process and mix into it with a high and low shelf and \u201cpreamp\u201d on.

    "content": "So, I\u2019m a long-time follower of this thread, but have been to scared to post any questions as I\u2019m afraid to look like a total dumb ass\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a singer/songwriter/guitarist who has been teaching myself how to record/mix over the past few years. I don\u2019t totally suck, but I have a long way to go.\n\nI\u2019m working on a mix for a client\u2014yes that\u2019s new for me\u2014and I want to kill myself \ud83d\ude42\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a big, dumb rock song (I.e. Foo Fighters), and I can\u2019t for the life of me reign in the drums\u2014in other words, there\u2019s freaking cymbal bleed in EVERY mic. So, I have this situation where I tame the shitty cymbals\u2014then get something that sounds like kick and snare samples playing along to a vacuum cleaner. Mostly because I\u2019ve put every stinking plug-in like Soothe, multi-band compression and dynamic EQ on the overheads and rooms. Yeah! My cymbals don\u2019t poke your ears out\u2014but, they also sound like a Rumba.\n\nAnd gating did not work as the drummer is hitting his shitty cymbals on every freaking beat! I ended up sampling a god forgive\u2014clean snare hit and using that as a sample. It\u2019s okay, but without being able to raise the level of the rooms and overheads, I\u2019m kind of fucked.\n\nI found myself referencing this Joel Hamilton production/mix of a Highly Suspect song as it\u2019s kind of similar to what I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s on Puremix. He\u2019s pretty amazing. And while the music isn\u2019t my thing\u2014it sounds awesome. His mix sounds big and organic\u2014while mine sounds like an electric ham sandwich.\n\nWithout hearing the song, I don\u2019t know how much advice I can expect. I just mostly want to vent\u2026\n\nI sometimes wonder if I\u2019m the one that sucks, or is it the source material? When do you know you\u2019ve done the best you can with what you\u2019ve been given? You can\u2019t polish a turd. \n\nAnd as a newbie dipshit, I\u2019m trying so hard to make whatever I do be super awesome, badass\u2014whatever that means. But, maybe I just need to make the rough mix sound 20% better. I don\u2019t know.\n\nWow! That was long. Thanks for any advice\u2026",

There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

I have a rack unit and the UAD and NI plugin versions.  We can blast through the rack unit and get a lovely crunch that just doesn't happen in the software models.

Freezing tracks first can make it go way faster. As for mixbuss, I take off my final limiter (or turn down the input, however the song was sent to mastering)\u2026 I\u2019m usually not compressing the buss hard enough for it to matter. Sometimes the sum of the stems ends up sounding better than the mix! Generally people are using them for their MD to create a live show, or for dance remixes etc. For sync most people seem happy with instrumental and accapella in my experience so far?  Also if your trying to key your mix buss compressor from a printed mix, freezing most of the session first (besides fx etc and aux tracks) seems to help the side chain feel pretty close to what the mix was. I don\u2019t bother with it though most of the time as I\u2019m doing a couple db at most on the buss comp.\n\nEdit: one other idea I\u2019ve messed with pre soundflow, is, if your just doing subgroups and have the routing setup, save your mixbuss as a track preset and when your ready to print recall it on all your masters and commit the tracks. It works for me unless im using too much uad etc.",

From what I have seen on his MWTM videos, his mix setup is pretty complex- lots of parallels and heavy mixbus compression, multiband compression. They all work together. Seems like a setup that would require a lot of practice and thorough understanding to drive it. It\u2019s a very particular setup that was derived from what he hears and simply using a small fragment of the compiled setup isn\u2019t going to be much helpful to me at least. What would have been useful is probably Waves Manny Marroquin plugin style package. \n\nThe reason why it made me think he may not use the plugin is because he had a few different ozone presets that he uses on different mixes. But this plugin doesn\u2019t seem to have the ability to emulate all of the different settings.",

If Waves is constantly on sale, then I'd suggest it's possible that it works AGAINST impulse buying by knowing you'll always have more chances (like Izotope).

I do that routinely too especially on lead vocals, mix buss, and other important elements, drums etc. Whatever I hear could be rebuilt better, I will if I have the option/access to the unprocessed files and it needs it.\n\nI guess I was more referring to when people take stuff off that is part of the vibe of the sound then say \u201cdo your thing, you can be creative!\u201d and then when it isn\u2019t identical to what they had, end up wanting me to use their thing because they heard it that way for 6 months.. ie really complex effect chains, a sound with 5 plugins stacked on it that, when removed totally changes the character of the sound, like @kylem  was saying which happens a lot with younger producers.\n\nWhen you send serban sessions, even if he zero's out the EQs and redoes the dynamics, I think starting off where the producer ended still has an advantage for everyone to see how the sausage was made, then he can decide to re create the elements he wants to using a better recipe. John Hanes even wrote a post on GS about how they want the actual sessions that match the production, and if they dont get them, he will go bar by bar on an important project to match it by ear to the rough before doing the actual mix...",

Not only was the threshold at its highest, but the board's master fader was also maxed out and brought down as needed. I havent been on that board in a decade but have moved that workflow to the plug-in compressor. Should I be incorporating a VU meter there or is the meter on the SSL essentially doing the same thing ?",

    "content": "**The Lin/Log Thing with FFT**\n\nSo \u2026. FFT and iFFT are a powerful thing. I\u2019m gonna play fast and loose with technical accuracy here in an effort to make this understandable and actionable for a real record maker\n\nAt its simplest an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is a mathematical process that splits a signal into a bunch of slices/bands/bins (technically it\u2019s component sine waves) which can be then acted upon or processed separately. This is *not* the same as a crossover or even a linear phase crossover, for various complicated reasons. The iFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) simply reverses this process and reconstitutes a single signal out of the many bands/slices/bins\n\nOk, off to a good start. It should be fairly obvious that the FFT bands in something like iZotope RX denote the number of bands a signal is split into\n\nNow, the whole point of splitting is so that we can do interesting and useful things to the various parts of the audio spectrum. Something like Oeksound Soothe allows us to do very trick control of a signal in somewhat more powerful ways than a typical multiband. There can be downsides (time domain blurring - more later) but oftentimes they are worth the price of entry\n\nNow, to the point of the post. The Linear/Logarithmic issue. Music/Audio is Logarithmic. What does that mean in practice? - let\u2019s take A440, the next octave up is A880 but the next octave doubles that to 1760 Hz (not 1320 as might be expected in a linear system). There are lots of videos about the deeper differences in Lin and log, SPL is another log domain which is why we use dB (a 3dB increase is double the power in an audio signal)",

Most of these people I work with now come to me for some outside thoughts on the production I might bring to a mix but even then it\u2019s such a sensitive zone, it\u2019s their child you are crafting essentially. So everything including the conversations must be dealt with that sort of care.  I only bring this up because both approaches as a mixer are valid and needed but you rely have to diagnose the situation carefully and forcing a vibe on a mix that just needs some plugins bypassed might not be the move. Sorry about your past trauma haha we\u2019ve all been there and I\u2019m sure there were lessons there and the very least it helped he skin get thicker",

Printing stems through mix busses, especially if they\u2019re elaborate and working hard, rarely add up the same. Best strategy so far is generate stems with mix bus chain bypassed, then we recreate 1:1 in ProTools. There are a handful of plugins that are DAW specific, especially in Ableton and FL, so recreating those is near impossible, and I usually just end up mixing in the DAW or printing a few basic stems to keep the vibe and then pop back into PT.\n\nMy dream and current work in progress for this scenario is:\n- Get stems (mix bus bypassed) and session from producer \n- import stems into ProTools\n- ensure all stems feed a master 2ch \n- route that 2ch ProTools out via AUX I/O, loopback, omnibus etc\n- new track in Ableton that picks up the corresponding input from PT\n- delete entire session except for mix bus processing and send out my interface\n\nThis does work, and sounds exactly how I\u2019d hope - but the latency is only just tolerable because it you\u2019re on the higher side of buffer sizes usually to avoid glitches\n\nIdeally I\u2019d route it back into ProTools so I can print back in easily, but there are a lot more glitches and often increased latency, so I just print a clean 2ch WAV and import it into Ableton when I need to print.\n\nHella annoying and elaborate, but it\u2019s the gig. \n\nThe only other thought is looking into internal Symphony mixer and seeing if that can somehow improve things. That\u2019s next on the list.",

It\u2019s a modular multi effect plugin, and making a few different presets on it allows me to quickly switch around between different colors and modulation. It has random parameter set feature and can unexpectedly bring in interesting sounds quickly too. Other than that, I also like Soundtoys stuff for phaser and tremolos, ubermod for chorusing and other phase effects on the delays. For reverb, Dverb is actually pretty cool especially when it\u2019s mixed in with delays. I like Valhalla vintage verb and eventide ultraverb as well. And for post verb or delay saturation, decapitator and spectre. Saturn if I wanna use the dynamics control on it. I also like messing with the polarity, sometimes flipping it can get the presence of the tail heard better without obscuring the dry sound as much.",

Then once you've possibly got something to work with, go through the usual steps you might process a vocal with  (more additive/tone-shaping tools to get a sound).\n\nThing is, if you don't have all these plugins already it would be much cheaper to just record a better vocal.

    "content": "This is really valuable! Thanks a lot. To go into some of your questions; I'm using Adam a7's (not the newer a7x's, although I tested them and they're wasn't as much of a difference as I had expected in my room). My room has been treated with diy panels, 14cm thick Rockwool and it sounds decent for a home recording studio. the dimensions aren't great and low lend monitoring isn't top of the charts but it's workable. Any peaks and valleys i did have have been sorted out further as much as possible with sonarworks which has really outdone my expectations. I also use Beyerdynamics dt770 pro's. \nUsually a lot of time does actually go into clip gaining, cleaning up and taking harshness out of vocals. I often take as much time just manually leveling a vocal, taking out esses etc as I do mixing. Fresh air and dopamine have indeed been big helpers and have been big steps towards that sizzle. Also the waves exciter in parallel has been working okay.\nI never seem to be able to get a multiband compressor to work well. Either I'm overdoing some of the setting or something because often i feel like it attenuates too much and other times to little in the places I want it to. I've noticed that a little boost in the low mids on pro-q3 that then also attenuates dynamically can work. \nCould you go into a bit more detail on what you mean with phase bringing a vocal more forward?\nI've also noticed that a lot of the sound I'm looking for comes from a certain sort of rolling kind of sound that might be coming from the rappers throat? I'm not sure at all about this but it seems like it's almost vocal fry but in a very natural way that is inherent to the singers/rappers voice. Idk if this is a rapping technique thing or if this is more accentuated in the mixing process, but it sounds really nice.\nDefinitely a big thankyou for all the tips!",

But I actually don't think some beginners know what is meant and I do think it's important to distinguish between the terminology of 'secrets' and 'techniques'. I find that people like shitty YouTubers will often have you believe that that one single plugin or chain or technique used on one particular song that was discussed on one Pensado's place episode will transform all your mixes and get you to sound like mixer X,Y,Z. These ideas are missing an immense amount of context, making one specific use case of a technique sound like a deeply guarded mixing secret. I'm just trying to provide that context and I think that's what Matt and Jon are awesome at.",

    "content": "A hard clipper will behave differently than the digital clipping that occurs when you clip your converters or when you export a signal that exceeds 0db at a bit depth of 24bits. Your daw works internally at 32bits floating point, which means that your individual faders will have a lot of headroom above 0 db, so you can go pretty much as high as you want with them, as long as you turn the signal down in a later stage before it hits the final output. Otherwise you will be clipping your converters like you said. This clipping will be different for every converter, and it's why mastering guys buy converters that are worth more than your car, just so they can get a certain flavour when clipping their a/d (although I'm pretty sure most have stopped doing this, because it often just sounds like shit lmao). Clipping your signal with a plugin will introduce different distortion/saturation/artifacts. It will even be different between different plugins and between different algorithms inside of those plugins (if you are able to select those)  (some clipping plugins actually use the exact same algorithms, so those won't have any differences ofc. EDIT: the only differences here would be in the oversampling functionality etc. of the plugins used, not in the actual clipping algorithm. There actually aren't a lot of hard clipping algorithms out there, so most differences between plugins will be in the way the anti-aliasing filters work)",

I mixed a score once with different PT track folders for each stem, and dedicated reverb/delay returns for each instrument group to keep things separated.\n\nI could offline commit all of the folders at once, and after a couple minutes of rendering I had stems. And in film it\u2019s very important that the stems match *exactly*. BUT there was no master buss processing, intentionally.\n\nBut if you were to take your master chain and put it on, say, the last 5 inserts of each folder, identically, and only use dynamics plugins with sidechain inputs, you could feed your mix buss input to the sidechain of all those plugins. Then create a mix group wherein the settings for inserts f-j are linked\u2026\n\nThis would obviously be an ITB-restricted solution with a heavy processor load. And I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019d set it up in Reaper, but it\u2019d probably be even better than in Pro Tools",

    "content": "funny thing just happened to me : i made like 16 tracks of the same vocal with every uad preamp, to compare them and pick the best for the song. i did a blind test using hofa's blindtest plugin (which i recommend 1000% and is free for use on up to 3 tracks, otherwise 40$) and my favorite preamp was the neve 1073 and for compressor is either the la-2A silver or the fairchild 660. \n\nI find it interesting that, even with a lot of choice, my ear is naturally drawn to that chain. Probably because it's the sound of pop music today. Btw, i never used the 1073 before on recording/producing/mixing",

I found myself having to turn up the low shelf a lot to account for how bright it is.\n\nThe level rider seemed pretty good. And the compressor gets pumpy quick, but it was alright in small doses.\n\nThe doubler felt great and the two verb options sounded excellent, but I could see them being limited because they only have a dry/wet control.\n\nOverall I like that it can act as an instant-vibe plugin for when you want to move quickly through a session. It\u2019s got zero latency, which is great and seemed very light on CPU. But it\u2019s not a fit for every style. Seemingly just for big pop stuff.",

Otherwise yeah not sure if there's a shortcut in every daw for applying bus processing to individual channels unless you manually print each one.

You can use DSP plugins while tracking with this high buffer size and have low latency. \n\nThat said, I was doing 24 track recording at 128 buffer size on a mac trash can (64 gig ram) with native plugins with no issue. Then i started working at the studio I\u2019m at now and it\u2019s an older mac pro and we have an apogee symphony with HDX, so I utilize that workflow there: using only dsp plugins and having the buffer size high.

So if you end up not digging the clipped drums vibe you can still get some mileage out of the plugin for fuzzes, distortions, etc",

Izotope insight has a very good spectrograph that clearly reveals what\u2019s happening down at 20-30 hz and how much energy is there . We ve also discussed izotope tonal balance here as well , but it\u2019s really a very handy diagnostic when used to investigate where your low end energy is against a referenced track you like . Izotope Match eq is another tool that again allows you to compare and contrast what\u2019s happening in your low end . I\u2019ve also found the Shawn Everett trick mentioned here , useful for investigating low end (put a brick wall low pass filter on your mixbus and sweep it down to the 20-30hz with your subs on and see what that actually sounds and feels like . The other thing I find helpful is my gain staging and buses are set up so that I know how much gr and level should be arriving at each bus , so you soon know if you\u2019re too hot just by looking at the comp / limiter . The last thing I\u2019d say is know your speakers . I apply all this to myself because translation is my main point of focus right now . I forget where I heard it said , but I heard it said that the listener hears the inverse of what we the mixers hear .",

Or honestly using the delay as an insert into compression will release really naturally.",

Focus on getting the EQ targets dialed in with your mix, and the input target not clipping..  This taught me SO much about loudness.  My mixes consistently hit -9rms and -9 lufs when I get them dialed with EQ, and I no longer get the \"smushed\" feeling I used to get when trying to get loud. The mix actually breathes and is loud AF. Then when I get the eq targets dialed in, I see where I am hitting large amounts of peaks over 3-4db on the limiter, and then I address those peaks at the source in different ways. The God Particle I truly think can be a teaching tool, as well as a great sounding mix bus tool. I am now using it less and experimenting with my own chains. But seriously, this may help you as it helped me. The GP does not suck and I will always have it in the bag as sometimes it is just the right sauce.",

So far I've used a usual suspects \u2014 pair of COMP-2A and 1176, I've tried my variable gain compressor (which I don't usually use for vocals) and both worked okay-ish, but I was looking for maybe a good plugin so I can streamline my process a little bit rather than bouncing the vocal tracks through hardware all the time.\nAppreciate your input.",

The VU meter to highlight how the mix is behaving pre-limiter :\nVU (Volume Unit) Meters essentially display an average of what we hear, rather than the very fast peaks that we don\u2019t. they will show you the energy in the low end, and if there is radical movement, then you probably have an issue with frequencies that you aren\u2019t hearing.VU meters should \u201cdance\u201d smoothly and in a gentle manner, usually in time with the music, rather than in big jumps and erratic, out of time movement.\u00a0 This erratic movement implies that there are drastic level changes, which will be hard to control in mastering and need addressing in the mix.  \n\n2.

I often have to turn down the input level of the whole mix like this on the first plugin of my mixbus chain (because it's clipping the fuck out) because I'm mixing very aggressively with faders and wild boosting. I know I could probably do this with an aux channel, but the problem with that is I would have to re-route everything. \n\nWould this essentially be the same as floating point level adjustment like with aux channels or Am I just turning down a clipped mix? I don't necessarily audibly hear clipping but it could be just me being used to it and my perception being messed up over time.",

    "content": "And from the manual:\n\u201cThe enhance process improves the perceived loudness and presence of the programme material by modifying the dynamic and harmonic content of the signal. Since the method used is different from the Pre-Processing section, it can further enhance the perceived volume of a previously processed signal, while suppressing all signal overloads. As the limiting action does not involve conventional sample value clipping, harsh distortions are avoided, and programme detail and dynamic information is largely retained.\n\nAlso, since the plug-in has internal headroom, transient levels greater than notional maximum modulation can pass from the Limiter section into the enhancement stage. This means that percussive overshoots, that would normally be lost in a conventional limiter (or would give rise to overloads), may be included within the sonic results of the plug-in, producing both richer dynamic sonic detail and a useful reduction in the perceived artefacts of the limiting process, all without giving rise to any sample value overload.\n\nThis property enables slower attack times to be used in the Pre-Process section, without creating output overloads, which would otherwise result in a need to reduce output levels.\u201d",

I've noticed lately, that when I go God Particle to Fabfilter L2, the sides of the music push out significantly more. I've been getting more clarity in the instrumentation of my mixes. The compromise is less saturation, but I think I like the separation (the fabfilter or Ozone limiter was only ever doing 1-2dB of work, but still completely changing that final spectrum. I'm having trouble telling how soon my mixes overload with the Pro L-2 unfortunately. Do you think wider is better? or is a trick and it's too wide, and all that width is overload? I have trouble detecting overload in my Insight2 Plugin, I only notice it on phone speakers after the fact. any advice to help decide?",

    "content": "Clippers can be great on busses. Great on drums etc\u2026 I find Standard Clip to be super intuitive to use and you can visualize what is happening. (Probably helpful if you are trying to gain understanding)\n\nOn the mixbus it can be helpful before the limiter but most of the time I would introduce it towards the end of a mix if at all. I would try hard clipping or a more gentle knee and see if between that and a limiter I can get something better than limiting alone.\n\nKeep in mind that any saturation plugin (tube/tape) on the mix bus is \u201cclipping\u201d (soft clipping) and I find that gain staging in to that type of processing is more friendly to mix in to rather than hard clipping.",

    "content": "TLDR: The document discusses the claims of sound quality and superiority between different audio software. It concludes that no evidence supports these claims, and any perceived differences in sound are due to variations in software algorithms, particularly in how they handle signal levels and pan groups. These differences do not indicate one software's superiority over another but rather reflect different mixes with varying balances. The document also highlights that any discrepancies caused by third-party plugin incompatibilities should not be mistaken for differences in sound quality. The concept of \"better sound\" is subjective and not quantifiable.",

Beyond reps and intuition, are there things that have helped you hone in on this? And are you consciously adjusting your \u201cthreshold\u201d based on the music or genre you\u2019re working with or do you have a general taste for how you like to hear things regardless of the style and use other tools to get the character and vibe you\u2019re going for.\n\nIn other words, do you think about how far you go with these tools as a creative and stylistic decision or more of a functional one?",

I like how it sounds, it\u2019s very subtle but it does the thing where it sets the whole mix in front of you and you can separate sounds more easily. Kinda like when I turn on oversampling on a limiter or clipper, where you get less peaky distortion. While that is great on the other hand what I notice is that transients get less \u201cvisceral\u201d, like putting over a blanket or something (really hard to discribe I find). How do you guys feel about that? I\u2019m honestly a bit lost with how I want to approach it, cause I see the benefits but also I\u2019m not sure about the trade offs",

The rapper artist of this song requested me to export the stems then he'll bring them to the mastering engineer. So that's why i'm doing so. The artist allows me to mix the instrumental i produce, and i am aware that i need to take the limiter off when sending these files out for mastering.  \n\nTo be honest, i'm not understanding the external sidechain part you're talking about. Maybe i'm not experienced enough \ud83d\ude26 I mostly use sidechain for bass/808 and instruments and the input would be the kick. I haven't try sidechain for other any purpose than that ever. And the SPL IRON i'm talking about is a plugin. Could you please elaborate more about \"feed plugins for externsl sidechain to keep it closer to 1:1\"? Thanks Adam!",

    "content": "All good it\u2019s a little tricky at first and just really difficult to explain typed out for me.\n\nSame concept as using a sidechain input from a kick drum to duck the 808 - an external sidechain allows us to give the compressor something to listen to and apply the compression from that source to another source.  When the kick is fed to a compressor on your 808 channel - the compressor \u201clistens\u201d to the kick and applies the compression curve from the kick onto the bass.\n\nSo in your case of printing stems with a mix bus compressor - you want the SPL Iron plugin to \u201clisten\u201d to the entire mix as it heard it before but then apply that compression to one track at a time.\n\nWe can do this in Ableton with some clever workarounds, which would be a lot more efficient to show you on a video call on the server if you are free later.  Essentially you need to print a version of your song at each point in your mix bus chain where there are dynamics plugins (just before the Slate plugin, just before the Iron Compressor but after all the other plugins) and then send that audio to those corresponding plugins\u2019 external sidechain inputs and then you can use the \u201cinclude return and master effects\u201d and get the result you are looking for",

Back bus gets compressed more aggressively than I would do a mix bus. Blend that under the mix bus to taste. Really good for locking all the instrumentation together around vocals without dynamics getting pulled around by the drums. I think Andrew uses some kind of 1176 but the idea works with all kinds of compressors.\n\nMix bus and backbus both feed into a 2-bus where more processing may happen. Something like Pultec EQP1q, tape emultion, Pro L2? But I like to change things up!",

Every extra minute spent on trying to iron it all out there will save you hours in editing and mixing. I\u2019ve often considered selling a piece of gear and then had a really stellar vocal go through only to realise there was nothing wrong with the gear. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of reading it but the performance is everything. You can\u2019t REALLY EQ air and body into a vocal that isn\u2019t there. You can\u2019t try simulate it alright. And you can\u2019t create actual excitement with compression, just try and trick the brain into thinking there\u2019s excitement. A 57 into any preamp into any interface with a stellar performance will sound amazing. \n\nAfter that is just treatment, and it\u2019s essentially pointless discussing chains because it\u2019s so song and vision dependant. \n\nA boring answer I know but you\u2019ll save a lot of headache and heart ache the sooner you learn it. \n\nIt\u2019s like when you hear a new compressor plugin just explode a drum room and it sounds amazing. Analogue glue, explosive release, so much groove. And then you slap it on the lacklustre room and performance you actually have in front of you and it doesn\u2019t seem to sound so amazing any more.",

    "content": "Yeah, love soothe, using it to control  the low mid resonances on this thus far. Maybe I could dig in a bit harder for the highs with it. Bloom didn\u2019t work, it made it sound a bit more plastic-y and actually made the grainyness more pronounced. I haven\u2019t gotten good results with bloom on female vocals so far, but I know that one day it will be just the thing needed. I think that probably RX will yield the best results, but for some reason I find myself resisting digging in with RX on this, probably because I know it\u2019s going to be hard work and I\u2019m a little lazy. Good lazy, though, because if I\u2019m not I try too hard and end up taking away what\u2019s good. \n\nI don\u2019t have Ozone, but maybe this is what will push me over the edge to try it, hmmm. \n\nI was thinking that maybe some sort of tape thing could work, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work with Tupe inmediately and the UAD Ampex made it brighter and more distorted. It kind of feels like it\u2019s already on the edge of breaking up too much and becoming unpleasant, a bit like being touched softly on the arm when you have a fever and it\u2019s almost painful. Hmm, now I\u2019m just blabbering on. I\u2019ll stop for now. Thank you for your suggestion!",

I've been mixing a live recording recently with which I thought was causing clocking glitches due to the audio being 2496.  I've been trying to narrow down the cause and tried different drives, bypassing all plugins and until today when I dug further I discovered momentary glitches on the raw audio files recorded by the FOH.  They become a lot louder when bringing the mix up to commercial level.  There is no other recording so I'm wondering how you would approach this in RX.  It's across every track on the gig which is not ideal.  Some screenshots from RX.",

Then I drive it through the free TSC 808 plugin for further emphasize the harmonics the bluey brings out. (EQ too)\n- Then, I use Audreio on the master to play the mix through my phone instead of my monitors. Once on the phone, you can blend the parallel with the bass in a way where there\u2019s little to no audible difference on a monitor, but the illusion of a bass can be heard through the harmonics playing on the phone.\n- It\u2019s a balancing act, but there\u2019s almost always a nice sweet spot to be found where it doesn\u2019t change the quality of the sound enough to be intrusively perceived on HD speakers, while giving life to the bass on lesser speakers.\n\nThis has helped my bass translate to more systems, and is the only time I find myself wanting to use the CLA76.",

That tends to be most useful when the phrase timing does not work, ie. too short for the timing of the phrase.

It immediately auto updated itself anyway.\n- Used the Uninstall buttons per plugin within UA connect, then reinstalled\n\nStill no joy\n\n- Closed Cloud Session in iLok License Manager\n- Reopened Cloud Session\n\nNothin'\n\n- Deleted iLok License Manager and all attendent prefs etc\n- Installed latest  ilLok License Manager\n\nStill nothin' \n\n- Manually deleted all of the .aax UA plugins in my PT plugins folder\n- Hit the uninstall button per plugin in UA Connect to reveal the Install button again\n- Installed all plugins again\n\nFinally got the bastards working!",
