    "content": "Maybe I can try and distill down some suggestions from the conversation for avoiding the pit of despair while referencing:\n\n1) Don't get stuck going back and forth constantly between your mix and your reference - you can get trapped in a loop\n\n2) Think critically about what elements are in the reference track versus what you are working with - is there enough overlap in production and arrangement that makes this a good reference?\n\n3) Focus on the broad strokes - I've seen it described on the server before as \"where the edges are\" - how wide is the mix, where's the top end sitting, where's the low end sitting, and what are the elements dominating those frequency spectrums\n\n4) Careful not to shy away from what the track wants to be to make it conform to the bell curve\n\nI'm probably missing a lot of things but here's a start?",

    "content": "Here\u2019s the one other thing about Serban that I think is obvious, but seemingly overlooked a lot\n\nThere\u2019s a trade off between dynamic control/having things locked in place, and allowing things to be wilder. Mixes where things are locked in place sound more similar everywhere, they are in a sense robust. Mixes with braver dynamic or EQ choices can be much more exciting under ideal conditions, but do less well at the edges of the bell curve (mono overhead speaker at the supermarket for example)\n\nSerban\u2019s mixes are very locked in place, dynamically and from a frequency point of view and so he has great translation. I rarely find it to get in the way of the song, but some of my mixer friends will go to the mat about how it could have been so much more \u2026. And maybe they\u2019re right\n\nBut if you win the race, and the song comes through then how much more do you need to win it by? His mixes do the job of getting pop songs into my ears, and give A&R confidence and comfort, a lot to like \u2026",

    "content": "Spent an hour this morning listening to mixes and reference tracks on Audeze LCD-5's MM-500s, LCD-X, LCD2, and Focal Clear MGs. After going back and forth and comparing for a while and taking breaks, I liked the LCD-X the least, just sounded weird and unnatural to me in the mid range, LCD-5s were my second least favourite which was surprising. I found Hats and things in that range had a really weird un-natural sound to them.. not sure how else to describe it. Just not for me. The Clear MG and MM-500s both sounded great, altho when i listened to some \"thicker/warmer\" mixes i'd done on the Focals, it felt like I would have scooped my mix too much if i'd been on them, because they were pretty full sounding/a bit boomy in the low mids/bottom, where the mixes sounded how i intended on the MM-500s. If i was buying with the intent to use them for production, or as a secondary reference, i'd probably go with the clears because they sound fun and were really comfy, have a bit more high end and bottom end.. but the mannys seemed flatter/sounded more natural in the bottom and top and more like what i'd want to hear while mixing i think.  Found a pair of demo MM-500s for a slight discount and pulled the trigger on them just now. Can followup in a week to see if after trying to mix on them i have buyers remorse or not \ud83d\ude02",

These three are always open on a second screen to my side. I have Tonal Balance set to the Fine mode, with the Modern curve preset, and with 5 second averaging instead of the default 10. I mostly just check it once I have a mix pretty much put together to see if I\u2019m missing anything as a dummy check, but I\u2019ll also look at it when comparing to a ref or playing with kick/bass levels. Sometimes it\u2019s also helpful to find a spot for a final element or two I\u2019m trying to shoehorn into a dense arrangement\u2014but for that I usually just pull up Spectre and push frequencies around until things sound good. (The instance of Pro-Q3 is for seeing more fine detail, and Insjght I\u2019m just using to measure loudness.)",

Like \"WHOA there is _way_ too much 1k in my vocal\" Anything more subtle is going to throw me down a rabbit hole of trying to match 2 completely different songs.",

One thing I'll do is if I do see a clump of something somewhere I'll start muting tracks that are in that range to see if a single source is causing the lump or it it's a broader number of sources.

    "content": "Damn we out here talkin about intonation systems? A lot of my bread and butter is contemporary classical/microtonal/experimental music and I'm in this world as both an engineer and often as a producer keeping track of how folks relate to the score and each other, take maps, etc. I tend to agree with some of the above that trying to chase down inharmonic relationships with EQ can make things worse, but I appreciate @LAPhill posting about bassoon/flute overtone series. @spectrummasters original question was about understanding the low mids and how they relate to EQing depending on the key; I think for me the way that understanding overtone series, tuning systems, and musical interactions in acoustic/orchestral instruments can relate to pop or rock mixing is like... Sometimes when I hear clashes between instruments playing thirds or clashes in the harmonic series and I'm trying to clear space in the mids/low mids, I do think about what instruments want to be occupying that space. So perhaps in the bassoon/flute example, I'd want the flute's fundamental to be stronger than the bassoon's first harmonic at C5, and that might look like EQing down the bassoon in the ranges of the flute's fundamentals, or in a rock mix looking at the bass's harmonics compared to where the lower range of the guitars are living. Obv instruments are moving and changing notes so none of this is surgical so much as the keys of the songs or the instruments' ranges might inform some general decisions about where to make space rather than just \"cut 300 on the bass\" or whatev",

Cue into what your reference mixes sound like in tidal on hifi with normalization off. Route that into your DAW with a virtual output and you can compare LUFS on your favorite meters. The truth is there are no standards and trying to beat/cheat every loudness algorithm is folly. Make good shit that sounds like your favorite un-normalized records. \n\nSomething else I have done, grab some CDs from a local library of your favorite records and put those wavs into a meter or RX and see what the pros are actually printing out loudness and peak wise.",

I instead like to flash some references only at the beginning of the day just to remind myself what good records feel like in my chair before I start trying to make them. I find that whenever I'm asking myself the kind of questions like \"do I have enough x, y, or z  frequency range\" it's more of a warning sign that I need a perspective break because these questions hardly ever arise in a true creative flow. That's not to say I don't fall into this rabbit hole regularly, I'm just trying to practice what I suspect is a better way out of it!",

My OG mix had this really aggressive edge to it that I kinda liked but it also felt way too scooped in the low mids. I checked out my old session and turns out I had cranked a ton of 8khz on the mixbus (a move I haven't felt compelled to do since 2021). Related I've been really enjoying thick / dense / full bodied mixes that still have excitement / edge up top especially for vocals and I had previously struggled to achieve a similar 'heft' in my own mixes compared to what I was hearing. I think in the past I was too quick to zap low mid resonances in my vocals / guitars. So I've been experimenting cutting less down around 200hz-600hz and emphasizing more. But then I felt I was losing some of that edge / excitement by see-sawing too much with the low mids relative to up top. I've found cutting some 170hz clears much of that up for me (like oh hey there's my snare or more room for kick / bass), I achieve the thickness above in that 200-600hz range and balance that with the excitement around ~8khz.

    "content": "Hey everyone, so a couple months ago I went to a workshop with one of the guys who worked on the loudness standard team for the european broadcast union and it was really interesting how he thinks about all that and how it translates to his mixing workflow in particular. So for those of you who don\u2019t know in broadcast you have to hit a loudness of -23 LUFS +-1dBTP throughout the program. This is especially tricky with live program as you can imagine. But having this fixed loudness target also has a major advantage, it\u2019s that you can have a fixed volume setting on your monitoring and with time you kinda know how loud you\u2019re mixing compared to if you\u2019re mixing for peak loudness, where you\u2019ll always land on different loudness depending on the program. This was the first time I really understood the advantage of that way of working, because with time you\u2019ll be so tuned to the loudness target you\u2019ll be able to really intuit every move. And since -23 gives you boatloads of headroom you can really push things during mixing and then still get the density through clipping/limiting after that. It kinda ties in with what @Nomograph Mastering  was saying about fixed monitoring level. What do you guys think about that?",

    "content": "Same situation here, I used to avoid the \"reality check\" at the beginning of the mix so I could move primarily by feel. But then I was consistently making macro EQ moves on the mix bus in order to match the references a bit more at the end of the mix (typical 2db presence boost, maybe some 200-300hz scoop). This was a real pain in the ass, cause naturally things change a bit at that point and it's not an effective way to handle the problem. So now I have a preset for MetricAB with 8 reference tracks ready to go that I listen for short periods of time, sometimes 5 seconds or so, just to keep my years calibrated to what \"normal\" feels like in a macro-level. The fact that I don't need to leave the DAW environment (changing the visuals as well) to open a streaming app with different stimulus makes it really convenient to just do the right thing and compare apples to apples. The band-isolation mode really helps me to compare how different frequency ranges are moving also",

As i understand it, it's not your DAW clipping it, its the audio leaving the daw and clipping your convertors. \n\nMy guess is this is Hard/Digital Clipping. But when I export the audio in the above scenario and compare it with the same thing but with a hard clipper plugin on the master, they do not null out.",

    "content": "@Gazing Wrmth | Mixes & Masters I\u2019m pretty much exclusively in cans and i second all of what Noah said. Additionally, sonarworks for your headphones is definitely worth it esp. for only 70 USD. It will smear transients a bit, but you can get over that if you reference well. Mix quiet and you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nForgot to mention, because DT 770s are closed back, making sure you have a good seal and taking breaks are critical. You need a 15 minute break for every hour you put in on cans, bare minimum IMO. Without that, attention loss and fatigue kick in. \n\nTools like tonal balance control 2 are important. I recommend setting up a Pro-MB with 3-5 bands across the entire frequency range but make them all neutral with no compression. Sub, low, mid, high mid, top end. You can monitor specific ranges now. And for sub/low end, you can turn the gain up on your headphone mix a bit, isolate the low end, and you can hear it a bit better. Make sure you turn your headphones down a bit before you un-solo the low or the sub, but this has helped me massively",

Izotope insight has a very good spectrograph that clearly reveals what\u2019s happening down at 20-30 hz and how much energy is there . We ve also discussed izotope tonal balance here as well , but it\u2019s really a very handy diagnostic when used to investigate where your low end energy is against a referenced track you like . Izotope Match eq is another tool that again allows you to compare and contrast what\u2019s happening in your low end . I\u2019ve also found the Shawn Everett trick mentioned here , useful for investigating low end (put a brick wall low pass filter on your mixbus and sweep it down to the 20-30hz with your subs on and see what that actually sounds and feels like . The other thing I find helpful is my gain staging and buses are set up so that I know how much gr and level should be arriving at each bus , so you soon know if you\u2019re too hot just by looking at the comp / limiter . The last thing I\u2019d say is know your speakers . I apply all this to myself because translation is my main point of focus right now . I forget where I heard it said , but I heard it said that the listener hears the inverse of what we the mixers hear .",

The VU meter to highlight how the mix is behaving pre-limiter :\nVU (Volume Unit) Meters essentially display an average of what we hear, rather than the very fast peaks that we don\u2019t. they will show you the energy in the low end, and if there is radical movement, then you probably have an issue with frequencies that you aren\u2019t hearing.VU meters should \u201cdance\u201d smoothly and in a gentle manner, usually in time with the music, rather than in big jumps and erratic, out of time movement.\u00a0 This erratic movement implies that there are drastic level changes, which will be hard to control in mastering and need addressing in the mix.  \n\n2. The LUFS meter post limiter to set your loudness levels\n\nPersonally, i dont use this MO ...i like izotope tonal balance to monitor the mix but....just wanted to share what i rememmbered about people using vu ITB",

Two are used in the same way as those in the standard AirPods, for listening to the wearer's voice commands, allowing interaction with Siri, and for answering phone calls. The other two microphones are actually situated in the portion of the earbuds that fit inside the ear. Apple isn't trying to listen in on your internal conversation with this placement. Instead, these microphones hear the sound as it is formed by your ears and picks up on any leak-through from a less than ideal fit. This means the AirPods Pro don't adjust the sound to some theoretical model, but rather tune it specifically for each individual, and even to each ear.\"",

Another dip in the dunning kruger effect happening unfortunately and im starting to compare my mixes again to the goats. \n\nIve been down the serban rabbit hole the last week and i think the one thing that i want to improve upon that is inspired by him is more midrange clarity. The feeling that almost nothing is being masked. Like everything has a home. Has anyone had that \u201caha!\u201d moment and could share some tips on carving space for vocal/overall mix clarity. I love my mixes overall, but nitpicking on what i could improve, so any tips are super appreciated!",

That mentality is nonsense. I now have two reference tracks and that's all - Boulevard of Broken Dreams and my new one Spin Doctors \"Two Princes.\" I actually don't like the mix of Two Princes, really, but something about it is so stable - And there has to be something to be said for the fact that it's been on the radio for eons... So, to answer your question more directly - That is actually precisely when I reach for a reference track- When I go \"There's nothing really more that I can do here...\" The reference tracks point those things out, and I find they don't violate any of my creative sovereignty or what have you. I usually only make sliiight, slight tweaks after the reference tracks - mostly just levels... Thanks.",

The resonances could be due to the phase relationship between the notes/samples. maybe in a good place on some of em and a bad place on others.

    "content": "I understand the perspective of (lufs don\u2019t matter) however I want some consistency amongst my songs AND to be sufficiently loud compared to others.\n\nI am competent of achieving very loud mixes however the introduction of artifacts bothers me. Usually I\u2019m low passing with ISOL8 to listen for limiting/clipping clicks. These artifacts are unable to be heard unless I have a low pass filter active but I theorize that they, along with the extreme compression subconsciously degrade the listening experience by discretely assaulting your ears to the point of needing to take a break from listening. \n\nMy music can be related sonically to clara la sans \u201canother night\u201d give or take more or less busy. (Keep in mind her stuff is cranked to the point of audible artifacts sitting around -7ish lufs integrated across the chorus).\n\nI arrange the mix well and leave 1db of headroom for summing on individual instruments whilst they are loud enough for my target of -10 LUFi across the chorus, meaning my mix is actually 1db louder than -10 with space to sum on the pre master bus. Leaving headroom means I can introduce less artifacts at the cost of having to squeeze the dynamic range of individual instruments more than otherwise.\n\nMy issue is that If I want to aim for let\u2019s say -8LUFSi across the chorus in a relatively clean way with minimal artifacts, I\u2019m forced to squeeze the mix to -7.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear y\u2019all thoughts on whether or not technically inaudible artifacts/distortion matter and whether or not it\u2019s really worth for me to squeeze my mix 2db more in the name of competitive loudness?\n\nPs. Please bear with me as I am trying to figure this all out solo. Feel free to criticize my approach.",
