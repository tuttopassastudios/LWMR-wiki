Great for commerce, kinda a bummer for creativity and art. \n\nSometimes a heavier hand with processing on the final mixbus can help those things gel a bit, to blur those lines. When I got to work with Zedd he said he basically mixes and masters all his own stuff because if you were to take off his mixbus schmutz the whole thing falls apart, and no one else can put it back together to his satisfaction. But he\u2019s basically involved in every inch of his mix from writing to programming to mixing. \n\nWhat exactly are we doing anymore, what are we trying to achieve with the mix. The how is easy.

    "content": "This is tangentially related, but I think Gullfoss can be a helpful guide-rail for new/intermediate mixers, but it requires commitment to the premise to be effective. I'll explain:\n\nWhen used on the Master Buss, Gullfoss can provide a positive improvement in mixes. The trouble comes if you have a habit of solo'ing your tracks or groups when you mix. When you solo, Gullfoss will adjust it's curve to optimize for the solo'ed sound. This can lead mixers to make changes to the solo'ed elements that are even *less* effectual than if they'd been solo'ing on a non-Gullfoss buss. It can lead inexperienced mixers to chase their tail even more if they aren't careful.\n\nSo I'll summarize it like this: To gain benefit from Gullfoss you have to commit to mixing without solo'ing (generally a good practice), otherwise it will continually re-adjust itself and exacerbate the tail-chasing that comes from mixing and making moves while solo'ed.",

Clearly there's been an evolution to things coming in more fully baked, but recently I had a whole record where the sessions came in fully baked. They sounded very good, were incredibly intricate in how they were layered, and the bus processing was such a massive part of the sound that anytime I tried to build up something my own way, it wasn't even in the same ballpark. I ended up buying every plugin on the clients master bus and 'resigned' myself to small tweaks. I totally changed my approach and it became incredibly liberating... to know that something is already so close to being finished, but spending my time throughtfully making small changes that amounted to a 10-15% gain.",

I've always strayed away from it in lieu of keeping things fluid for easy recalls. However, since I've been doing 100% of my mixing in this studio and this gear probably isn't goin anywhere, I've been more comfortable leaning on a hardware chain with (what I think are) great results. \n\nFirst, I'm going into an old UTA Unfairchild. This was the first model that came out with the 6BC8 tubes instead of the current 6386 tubes. I always preferred the older model and was lucky to snatch one when Barefoot kicked the bucket. I'm not actually doing any compression, I've just got gain at unity and signal passing through. The second stage is a pair of UTA MPEQ-1's. I *thought* that I was doing a high shelf boost starting at 8.3k going into a LPF @ 22k. \n\nI've really, really been enjoying the sound of this. I notice a little midrange clarity from the unfairchild and I find the additive high end on the buss is much more musical than boosting individual elements.",

    "content": "Just from the hour of watching JC mix yesterday I understand a little better how things get \u201cloud\u201d in his mixing. He uses peak limiters and clippers everywhere, so nothing has a chance of peaking out from where he placed it. That\u2019s in effect trimming all the Attack of an instrument but not really messing with the decay sustain or release because with a peak limiter it\u2019s acting so fast that you can use it to manipulate a sound without it drastically changing the other aspects of it ADSR in synth world works the same in all audio. A clipper does the manipulation for \u201csaturation\u201d to get the desired grit that we might have gotten in yesteryear from things like tubes tape and transformers.\n\nI think that it\u2019s likely a smart fast and easy way to get a result like JC is looking for where it\u2019s loud and sounds open still. Because you can\u2019t really hear the peak limiting like you can hear a compressor doing 4:1 compression. Also know JC has a 1k \u201chandicap\u201d as he calls it on his mix bus, pulling out a few db and he is using the spectral shaper from 1-6k to tame harshness on the mix bus. (Don\u2019t do this just because he does) These are things he\u2019s added because it helps him get to his desired result faster, and when you mix one or two songs a day everyday for years you\u2019re going to develop \u201ctricks\u201d or \u201chandicaps\u201d or whatever you want to call them to help you get to your desired result.\n\nLearn everything you can about mixing if that\u2019s what you want to do, and use only the things you try that YOU like, not because someone else makes work you like, your mileage may vary",

But anyway\u2026\n\nAnother reason for my certainty about this is that there are so many records I listened to in my teens (pre any recording/mixing/critical listening experience etc) that *felt* amazing and blew my mind then, and still do now - even though now I can step back and hear the abrasive guitars, out of tune everything, etc etc.\n\nAll this to say that the reason I don\u2019t ever feel like I\u2019ve triumphed / bested a climb is that in 1/2/5 years from now, I\u2019m going to listen back on my work from today and cringe at the over brightness, the congestion, the brickwall filter ringing at 732Hz \ud83d\udc40, the mixbus compression folding too hard on that downbeat\u2026",

Having such finite time with trying to run the mix business, stay relevant in the recording business, the kid, family, social life, hand-holding Beckley through his massive speaker insecurities... it's hard to justify jumping into something like this without having a conversation about expectations (and compensation). 10 years ago I would have just done it and have been happy for the work. Now, I think its worth bringing up to the artist. If you're re-playing instruments and potentially adding parts, an additional production credit is entirely reasonable... even if there's no royalty.",

Any busses you want printed need to be showing as \"tracks\" in the Arrange window. You can do this from your Mix Window by selecting all busses/auxes you want to print, right-click, choose \"Create Track\", and now those Busses/Auxes will show up in your Arrange Window. Do this for any and all effects, parallel busses, etc etc\n\n2. ignore step 2\n\n3. Turn on your Cycle range you want to export (yellow bar across the top like Marv said) and select all tracks you want to export\n\n4. File --> Export --> All Tracks as Audio Files\n\n5. If next dialog box doesn't have options showing, smash that Options Button and choose various options\n  a. Range: Export Cycle Range Only\n  b. Uncheck \"Bypass Effects Plug-ins\" if you want their processing\n  b. Include Audio Tail and Include Volume/Pan Automation selected\n  c. Normalize Off\n\n6. I suggest making an AES-Standardly-named New Folder and exporting into that \n\n7. Export that bad boy\n\nThis will ensure you can import into your Industry Standard DAW exactly where they left off, minus the mix bus processing. \n\nIf they're sharing effects (e.g. guitar and vocal both going to a verb), and you want them both wet but also separate, then they'll need bounce those separately or dup the verb send/return (in which case their Valhalla Vintage Verb will be 12dB too loud b/c they'll forget to turn off their 2bus processing when they bounce it separately)",

But generally my approach might look something like this: First pull down the volume by a bunch. Then usually you\u2019ll want to add in some transients back again. I like Spiff for this to taste. Then sometimes Master Rebalance by Ozone can be a life saver. Especially if say the balance of some instruments are clashing with the vocal or the 808/bass is too loud in relation to everything else. Essentially I\u2019m \u201cunlimiting the beat\u201d. \n\nThen together with the vocal in the mix I\u2019ll try to shape the beat around the vocal with some subtle (usually reductive) eq moves. Something like dynamically sidechaining a bell on the hihat frequencies to the vocal can help a lot. Or I might also play with Spectral Shape. Some people get good results with sidechaining the vocal as a whole with trackspacer or soothe. Then if I\u2019m missing some super lows or excitement I might throw a Pultec/Bax-type EQ or Spectre on it. \n\nSo ultimately I\u2019m creating as much space as possible and give myself enough headroom to still do some typical mixbus moves.\n\nTo me this removes the need to do anything different on the mixbus.

What I learned is there is no right or wrong way to do anything  and it\u2019s good to try different approaches out but if you feel you are fighting something it\u2019s a good idea to check the processing and see if it\u2019s tying your hands.

    "content": "I think, again, it\u2019s knowing the reason you\u2019re using the tool, it\u2019s mostly used when you want to accomplish something on the sides or in the mono signal when you can\u2019t get to the track that needs the help, if your mixing, you should go to the track that needs the work first, not a M/S tool, M/S tools are designed for working on stereo tracks and shaping things because you CANT shape the original thing you want.\n\nExample, the vocal is a little quiet in the mix, using a M/S tool to help bring the 1-2k of the vocal out in the mid without bringing out too much 1-2k of the cymbals and guitars on the sides because that balance was already where you wanted it. In this situation you can\u2019t get to the vocal because you don\u2019t have the track, BUT if you\u2019re mixing, you can reach for the vocal and boost a narrow Q at 1500hz to accomplish the same task but in a cleaner way.\n\nThis is the type of reason I might reach for M/S, I don\u2019t reach for M/S if guitars need to be brighter on the sides, I find the guitars on the sides in my mix, and make them brighter.\n\nThis is also the same reason to argue against multiple bus processing, because if the ability to use such a processor is there, we will use it, take away a bus and we have to work harder to get the mix done, but the end result can be much more effective, impactful, dynamic, and inspiring, but it takes longer and requires a lot more finesse.",

    "content": "A few things I've found helpful is setting up my mix sessions with many points of control--- VCAs for all groups and then more specific (*All Music* *All Drums* *Kick/Snare* *All Vox* etc...) then a master fader controlling how hard I hit the 2bus. Starting with the biggest section of the song helps as well. I can then automate the other sections up or down *including the master fader feeding the 2bus*  As far as clipping/limiting on sources/busses I find it good to shape the sounds how I want (more heavy lifting) then the busses/2bus end up just glueing it together with a lighter touch. I think the 2bus doing too much of the lifting is where it can start to fall apart.",

I have 6 group buses: . Kicks , 808/Bass , Drums , Music, Vox , FX and only clip by 1-2 db at the mixbus . Nothing clips by design or accident anywhere else .....for rnb/hip hop build your mix the Alex tumay / mixed by Ali way , get that 808 up first, on its own ....as loud as you want it , then build everything around it afterwards. Filtering is your friend. Have nothing in the low end but your bass. Overall I\u2019d absolutely suggest watching Jon castelli mixing t Shine (he uses clipping well in there ) and mixed by Ali mixing YG , his mix balance and grouping is CHOICE.

Once he did this with all the elements, then he peels off the white noise and you supposedly have a pretty balanced mix.

I set up auxes and route stuff to them that will be a stem, so it\u2019s part of the prep process (i.e. route Lead Vocal to Lead Vocal Aux, Keys 1 to Keys 1 Aux and so forth), so choose what you will for the song and split up however much you need to. Then I use sends (or you can multi-output) to respective audio tracks and name them (you can also include Instrumental, TV Mix and A Cappella as their own audio tracks). Record-enable all the audio tracks, record them down. Then use Soundflow to copy the mix buss plugins you need (Copy Track Data macro), copy them to all the audio tracks, then use Track Bounce to offline bounce all of the stems in one go, and it will include the plugins. Takes about 10-15min.\n\nThe only caveat with this is that you have to route any effects to the same aux, like Lead Vocal Verb has to go to Lead Vocal Aux and nowhere else, so you can\u2019t share effects. But if you just create verbs for each thing as you go (or set up in your template) it\u2019s no problem.",

Almost always I would much rather refer people to a proper mixer...someone like @cian riordan  or @Adam Thein provides insane value IMO (also @Joshua Riley ). But I have, for whatever reason, recently been hit up more often about having me mix...and sometimes there isn't the budget to hire a proper mixer (I advocate for that up front whenever possible, even going so far as telling most people they should hire a mixer rather than me if they have to choose one).\n\nNormally I just do the stereo master in those situations after saying my piece about the value of a mixer, but when people don't want to hire a mixer I have been considering just asking for the session (was chatting this with @Joshua Riley actually the other day). \n\nOften when I hear the \"mix\", I know if I just had the session I could improve it by way more than just having the stereo file...say just raise this here a half db put some color only on the vocal, tweak the mixbus, but for a lot of reasons I haven't asked for that yet. Maybe I will try this and see about the results!\n\nCorollary is I find that stem \"mastering\" is honestly the worst of all the worlds, for me it would be either the standard stereo file master or give me the session. Which I would approach with a mastering mindset, accepting things for what they are and listening big picture.\n\nAlso I've come from producer/mixer land and being new to mastering in late 2022/2023 really...I am sorta less attached to what mastering \"is\" in the philosophical sense.\n\nI often think of mastering as just making the song better (to my taste and ear) within the almost arbitrary restriction of just having the stereo file. Of course this ignores the mindset of approaching a full project! Which is a huge part of mastering. \n\nBut as you stated, with how technology is evolving and the ease with which we can send stuff, may change. Excited to see where it goes!",

This is something I picked up as a seemingly innocuous truism but so easily overlooked from an Andrew schepps lecture  I watched . It\u2019s very poignant I can see your point completely and thank you for it . I mentioned in here before that I was struck by Stuart whites recent interview where he mentioned that he\u2019d thrown everything off his mix bus and gets louder more present mixes now than ever before . As a learning exercise I\u2019d been mixing from the start into a Serban/john Hanes style \u201cmastering bus \u201c and had been getting loud and satisfactory mixes but I just feel very bored with the sacrifices making things loud seems to demand . Like paralleling , as you mentioned. I noticed Jon Costelli saying on matts pod that he wanted to be able to do mixes like serban and manny , but you can\u2019t listen to those loud mixes without getting earache after 15 minutes imo. Sometimes I finish a mix and it all sounds right and it\u2019s loud but the version I liked was probably about -12/-13 lufs . If I just went by my ears and not the meters I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever go above -14 lufs and not parallel  anything lol Anyways I digress lol . I\u2019m defo on a journey and a quest and appreciate your  insights and pointers  man",

If it\u2019s the latter, you can create sidechain source tracks to feed plugins that allow for an external sidechain input to keep it closer to 1:1 (still likely not fully accurate with the nonlinearities in some analog modeled plugins).\n\nThis is a pretty tough thing to type out but if we can find a few minutes today where our time overlaps I\u2019m down to hop on a VC and show my workaround for this situation in Ableton.",

We\u2019re still on this learning journey so happy for any pushback or insight\n\nFor the most part, our group felt the tradeoffs of very subtle multiband often outweigh the benefits, since just putting those crossovers in the signal makes a bigger difference than, say, a dB of control.\n\nWe felt more liberal use of multiband can add an aggression and excitement that is very familiar and unique, and prefer treating it as a sweetener or energizer over the whole mix more than trying to control problem areas that could be addressed on tracks.\n\nIn the signal chain, its position can drastically effect how other tools behave. Up front, it can help a bus compressor or saturation device behave more predictably, but may mush things too much. Near the end, it allows those devices to play a more colorful role but may cause weird behavior when using fast, \u201ctransparent\u201d limiters afterward. I like it first right now, most of our group like it near the end.\n\nThe hallmark signs of overuse for us were mixes that sound overly strident or when a vocal becomes inconsistent tonally from section to section as density changes.\n\nTools-wise, the group unanimously preferred minimum phase tools over linear phase or dynamic phase. OTT is a starting point, ear training to recognize that color. Once you hear it at 15-20%, you won\u2019t be able to unhear it on many pop records. After ingraining that color, ML4000 and C4 both have their own flavors that can do a thing while offering tweakability when needed.",

There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

Freezing tracks first can make it go way faster. As for mixbuss, I take off my final limiter (or turn down the input, however the song was sent to mastering)\u2026 I\u2019m usually not compressing the buss hard enough for it to matter. Sometimes the sum of the stems ends up sounding better than the mix! Generally people are using them for their MD to create a live show, or for dance remixes etc. For sync most people seem happy with instrumental and accapella in my experience so far?  Also if your trying to key your mix buss compressor from a printed mix, freezing most of the session first (besides fx etc and aux tracks) seems to help the side chain feel pretty close to what the mix was. I don\u2019t bother with it though most of the time as I\u2019m doing a couple db at most on the buss comp.\n\nEdit: one other idea I\u2019ve messed with pre soundflow, is, if your just doing subgroups and have the routing setup, save your mixbuss as a track preset and when your ready to print recall it on all your masters and commit the tracks.

It\u2019s a very particular setup that was derived from what he hears and simply using a small fragment of the compiled setup isn\u2019t going to be much helpful to me at least. What would have been useful is probably Waves Manny Marroquin plugin style package. \n\nThe reason why it made me think he may not use the plugin is because he had a few different ozone presets that he uses on different mixes.

    "content": "Got a question for my Audio DSP nerds: Does convolution of two audio signals introduce phase shift?\n\nConvolution is most often used for reverbs, where phase shift is acceptable. But what if you convolved your audio signal with a fixed EQ curve that is 1 sample in duration?\n\nAs we all know, using a normal EQ imparts phase shift around those frequency bands, and an EQ curve with *lots* of bands, is likely to be a big, smeary, mess that distorts your phase relationships.\n\nWhat if you took a big complicated EQ curve (like the type that you'd see on a Sonarworks correction curve), sampled that, and then used it with a convolver plugin to re-apply that same complex filter to your mix buss? Would this method sidestep the phase shift that you get from using traditional EQ bands?",

    "content": "Convolution is a strange technique to describe in a way that is intuitive to understand. But here goes:\n\nIn convolution you have two audio signals, your *input signal* and your *impulse response*. The simplest description of what convolution does is that it multiplies the *input* signal by the *impulse* signal and what it spits out is a new audio signal that includes only the frequencies and amplitude values that both signals have in common.\n\nPractically speaking, what this means is that when you convolve an *input* (let's say, a full frequency drum kit recording) with your *impulse* (let's say a 5 ms burst of white noise that was hi-passed at 500 Hz). What you end up with is a drum recording that sounds like it was hi-passed at 500 Hz.\n\nThink of it like how a vocoder works (which isn't that different). Your vocoder might combine a full-frequency synthesizer patch (input) with the frequency contours and time content of your voice (impulse/carrier). But if your voice doesn't have 100 Hz in it then we never hear the 100 Hz from the synth patch because the input and carrier/\"impulse\" don't share that frequency. What you hear is what both signals have in common. If your voice has a huge peak at 1.5k, then the synth patch is going to be accentuated in that same way.\n\nSo. What I'm saying is that if I have a complex EQ curve (ala Sonarworks corrective EQ) that I use as my *impulse response* and convolve it with, say, the output of my stereo buss, will it impart that frequency curve onto my mix *without* the phase shift that you'd get from a traditional FIR or IIR filter (aka traditional EQs)?\n\nIn short, I don't know because it's hard to search for the answer online. But I'm throwing a hail mary in case we've got any DSP nerds in the forum.",

I do that routinely too especially on lead vocals, mix buss, and other important elements, drums etc. Whatever I hear could be rebuilt better, I will if I have the option/access to the unprocessed files and it needs it.\n\nI guess I was more referring to when people take stuff off that is part of the vibe of the sound then say \u201cdo your thing, you can be creative!\u201d and then when it isn\u2019t identical to what they had, end up wanting me to use their thing because they heard it that way for 6 months.. ie really complex effect chains, a sound with 5 plugins stacked on it that, when removed totally changes the character of the sound, like @kylem  was saying which happens a lot with younger producers.\n\nWhen you send serban sessions, even if he zero's out the EQs and redoes the dynamics, I think starting off where the producer ended still has an advantage for everyone to see how the sausage was made, then he can decide to re create the elements he wants to using a better recipe. John Hanes even wrote a post on GS about how they want the actual sessions that match the production, and if they dont get them, he will go bar by bar on an important project to match it by ear to the rough before doing the actual mix...",

The standard wild stuff going on...huge amounts of gold clip, all the new ozone bells and whistles, etc etc. Which aren't inherently bad but in my monitoring I can normally just get rid of it and use a simple EQ or something -- and I'm talking huge improvements. I think it's just down to a fresh perspective and great monitoring.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of it honestly, I don't plan on changing how I operate, the move is always to get artists and producers to great mixers IMO whenever possible, and I love the team aspect of that, I think the art is better for it.",

    "content": "I recently revisited a mix I initially did in 2021 for an as of yet unreleased project. A folk / rock / americana track. My OG mix had this really aggressive edge to it that I kinda liked but it also felt way too scooped in the low mids. I checked out my old session and turns out I had cranked a ton of 8khz on the mixbus (a move I haven't felt compelled to do since 2021). Related I've been really enjoying thick / dense / full bodied mixes that still have excitement / edge up top especially for vocals and I had previously struggled to achieve a similar 'heft' in my own mixes compared to what I was hearing. I think in the past I was too quick to zap low mid resonances in my vocals / guitars. So I've been experimenting cutting less down around 200hz-600hz and emphasizing more. But then I felt I was losing some of that edge / excitement by see-sawing too much with the low mids relative to up top. I've found cutting some 170hz clears much of that up for me (like oh hey there's my snare or more room for kick / bass), I achieve the thickness above in that 200-600hz range and balance that with the excitement around ~8khz. Pushing and pulling.",

I thought I was making things \u201cclearer\u201d by letting the music have a good amount of mid range to poke out, but really I was just covering up the vocal and making a mess, and leaving the low and high end lacking in energy. So my revelation has been to pay better attention to the space that the vocal needs and make sure I\u2019m making the music fit in with the vocal. Also, for me, multiband compression (in tasteful amounts) on the mix buss has been helping both with mid range control and overall better energy.",

Also helps you tailor any sort of 'sweetening' type things for the program material -- ie, all of the electric guitars could use a little low mid boost and a little air up top.... but if you do that on the master, you fuck everything up. Just sort of a different way of thinking about staging your elements into the final mix bus. I find that with this method, the actual mix bus does less work and you get alot of the impact & loudness without many of the downsides.",

    "content": "Same situation here, I used to avoid the \"reality check\" at the beginning of the mix so I could move primarily by feel. But then I was consistently making macro EQ moves on the mix bus in order to match the references a bit more at the end of the mix (typical 2db presence boost, maybe some 200-300hz scoop). This was a real pain in the ass, cause naturally things change a bit at that point and it's not an effective way to handle the problem. So now I have a preset for MetricAB with 8 reference tracks ready to go that I listen for short periods of time, sometimes 5 seconds or so, just to keep my years calibrated to what \"normal\" feels like in a macro-level. The fact that I don't need to leave the DAW environment (changing the visuals as well) to open a streaming app with different stimulus makes it really convenient to just do the right thing and compare apples to apples. The band-isolation mode really helps me to compare how different frequency ranges are moving also",

Like I said before it\u2019s very much something I\u2019d have tackled in the recording and arrangement had I have produced it from the beginning (I\u2019m on add prod. + mix) I think so I\u2019m hoping to retrofit this in at the mix stage.\n\nI\u2019ve since controlled some of those really big drum transients (thanks Unfairchild) and fed some room ambience through in parallel to the mix bus and it\u2019s feeling good and a bit more alive!

Printing stems through mix busses, especially if they\u2019re elaborate and working hard, rarely add up the same. Best strategy so far is generate stems with mix bus chain bypassed, then we recreate 1:1 in ProTools. There are a handful of plugins that are DAW specific, especially in Ableton and FL, so recreating those is near impossible, and I usually just end up mixing in the DAW or printing a few basic stems to keep the vibe and then pop back into PT.\n\nMy dream and current work in progress for this scenario is:\n- Get stems (mix bus bypassed) and session from producer \n- import stems into ProTools\n- ensure all stems feed a master 2ch \n- route that 2ch ProTools out via AUX I/O, loopback, omnibus etc\n- new track in Ableton that picks up the corresponding input from PT\n- delete entire session except for mix bus processing and send out my interface\n\nThis does work, and sounds exactly how I\u2019d hope - but the latency is only just tolerable because it you\u2019re on the higher side of buffer sizes usually to avoid glitches\n\nIdeally I\u2019d route it back into ProTools so I can print back in easily, but there are a lot more glitches and often increased latency, so I just print a clean 2ch WAV and import it into Ableton when I need to print.\n\nHella annoying and elaborate, but it\u2019s the gig. \n\nThe only other thought is looking into internal Symphony mixer and seeing if that can somehow improve things. That\u2019s next on the list.",

They all have the same fundamental tools we do, and any type of mixer tricks you hear about never make or break a given song, they just contribute to one's mixing sensibilities alongside many, many, many other moves. The switching mix bus comps move was a very circumstantial approach that just happened to work for that one Bruno song and I doubt it really happened much after that if at all. The actual knowledge Manny and others at the top of the game have to share is what I relayed and summarized before: understand music deeply, understand artists deeply, and deliver on their vision. Technique discussion is fun, but I don't think anyone here considers this podcast a \"mixer secrets exposed\" type of forum. There are plenty of shitty YouTubers spewing that content.",

It is smart, and for his workflow it\u2019s also fast and easy.\n\nI use compressors a lot, but I\u2019m also working in mostly indie rock with acoustic drums and bass guitars not 808\u2019s and drum machines, which is a drastically different world. I also think I\u2019m doing what most people don\u2019t do and I don\u2019t always love the artifacts of compression so I generally use slow attacks to maintain transients and fast releases to recover quickly (I adjust so that I get the fastest release before audible distortion)\n\nBTW Bruce Swedien while he may have evangelized not using compression don\u2019t underestimate that his greatest works were done to tape and even when you were conservative and didn\u2019t hit tape hard, the transformers going into tape and out of and the tape as a medium itself would peak limit attack heavy instruments like drums",

I\u2019ve just gotten too many sessions from people where there is so much bussing and subgrouping going on that by the time the vocal gets to the mix bus, it is passed through 3 instances off gullfoss and 4 different compressors and there is zero life in it. It quickly gets out of control. I actually find minimal bussing to be a quicker workflow because I don\u2019t have to follow a whole series of subgroups to know the entire processing chain on a given audio source when I\u2019m trying to make a tweak, nor will that tweak affect any other element that is sitting just fine.

I mixed a score once with different PT track folders for each stem, and dedicated reverb/delay returns for each instrument group to keep things separated.\n\nI could offline commit all of the folders at once, and after a couple minutes of rendering I had stems. And in film it\u2019s very important that the stems match *exactly*. BUT there was no master buss processing, intentionally.\n\nBut if you were to take your master chain and put it on, say, the last 5 inserts of each folder, identically, and only use dynamics plugins with sidechain inputs, you could feed your mix buss input to the sidechain of all those plugins. Then create a mix group wherein the settings for inserts f-j are linked\u2026\n\nThis would obviously be an ITB-restricted solution with a heavy processor load. And I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019d set it up in Reaper, but it\u2019d probably be even better than in Pro Tools",

For non-dynamic stuff like EQ, I'd maybe just copy the plugin chain to each individual channel you need?  Otherwise yeah not sure if there's a shortcut in every daw for applying bus processing to individual channels unless you manually print each one.  If you happen to be in Live there's an option when you print selected channels to \"Include Return and Master Effects\" which I believe also includes any busses you are running.\n\nOtherwise depending on what the stems are being used for can whoever you are sending them off to live with a grouped stem?  If it's going to an outside mixer maybe they'd be down to work from there?",

Izotope insight has a very good spectrograph that clearly reveals what\u2019s happening down at 20-30 hz and how much energy is there . We ve also discussed izotope tonal balance here as well , but it\u2019s really a very handy diagnostic when used to investigate where your low end energy is against a referenced track you like . Izotope Match eq is another tool that again allows you to compare and contrast what\u2019s happening in your low end . I\u2019ve also found the Shawn Everett trick mentioned here , useful for investigating low end (put a brick wall low pass filter on your mixbus and sweep it down to the 20-30hz with your subs on and see what that actually sounds and feels like . The other thing I find helpful is my gain staging and buses are set up so that I know how much gr and level should be arriving at each bus , so you soon know if you\u2019re too hot just by looking at the comp / limiter . The last thing I\u2019d say is know your speakers . I apply all this to myself because translation is my main point of focus right now . I forget where I heard it said , but I heard it said that the listener hears the inverse of what we the mixers hear .",

I\u2019ve tried limiting my drum bus, but it takes extreme limiting on the drum bus to have an effect on mix bus limiter (and I don\u2019t totally understand why). I guess I could try limiting drums/bass together, as maybe it\u2019s a phase issue with kick and bass adding together (talking live drums here, not programmed)\u2026 but any thoughts here are appreciated. \n\nSecondly, what range of limiting (aka -2 to -6db) are you guys doing on mix bus to have your overall mix at around-9lufs? I have been trying to only hit -2db of limiting on peaks for most of my mix, but have a really tough time accomplishing this and loudness. I love heavy/punchy low end, so maybe that\u2019s why.. \n\nI guess I have this idea/goal in mind that I should be able to make -9lufs mixes that are punchy with a lot of low end, while only hitting 2db of limiting, but it seems impossible.

My mixes consistently hit -9rms and -9 lufs when I get them dialed with EQ, and I no longer get the \"smushed\" feeling I used to get when trying to get loud. The mix actually breathes and is loud AF. Then when I get the eq targets dialed in, I see where I am hitting large amounts of peaks over 3-4db on the limiter, and then I address those peaks at the source in different ways. The God Particle I truly think can be a teaching tool, as well as a great sounding mix bus tool. I am now using it less and experimenting with my own chains. But seriously, this may help you as it helped me. The GP does not suck and I will always have it in the bag as sometimes it is just the right sauce.",

Since I'm getting pretty wide splits from the mixer, I'm able to save him the hassle of my tweaky notes and once the sonics of the track are nailed down, he sends me stems and I can do my stupid \"this flute phrase should be a bit louder,\" \"this guitar is more important in the blend than the piano here,\" etc. It keeps the mixer focused on the big moves and I spare him an hour per-cue of my nitpickyness. \n\nWe have a lot of trust, though.

If you know where the sweet spot of a compressor is on a drum bus for example, you can calibrate 0 on the VU meter to that sweetspot. then mixing into your compressor isn't such a guessing game every time (because you get the needle bouncing around 0, not too far under or not too far over). \n\ni use a digital one on the way out when i'm hitting my analog chain so everything goes out at the relative same level. i use an analog one on the way back in calibrated to a \"safe\" level and i know when it's coming back in ultra hot or i need a little extra gain to get it to the sweet spot. when you're monitoring stays at a consistent level, VU meters can help you judge relative relationships quite easily. i could see it being useful in the use case you described if you've calibrated the VU accordingly. say you want to generally hit -10 at the mixbus...calibrate a -10 signal to 0 on the VU. everything you then feed into the mixbus will show on the VU + or - where you want to end up.",

    "content": "Hey everyone, I have a question about your approaches to mix prep when receiving stereo files of things that should be mono (for some reason happens to me a lot when I'm sent tracks from Logic). At the moment I usually import everything and then go through each track flipping polarity on one side or sometimes with a vectorscope. And will then split to mono accordingly and delete the extra channels and adjust volume if necessary and it feels like a pretty inefficient process. Was wondering if anyone uses something like  StereoMonoizer or has a better option. Also curious if it even matters. I find something inherently wrong about seeing a kick drum mic on a stereo track but I currently work completely in the box and other than giving me a minor headache when I look at it, I can't tell if there's any real downside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is now also making me think more about bus settings. I typically default to stereo busses but am wondering if I should use mono ones for mono sources (for example when I use a folder/bus to combine snare top and bottom or kick in and out to a single channel). Again, probably doesn't make a meaningful difference but curious what you all do. Thanks!",

It\u2019s basically a group volume ride for frequencies instead of tracks. You can also do this on individual stereo tracks if just panning isn\u2019t granular enough. \n\nThe why & when is mostly about taste. I tend to mix into a proQ3 setting that has the sides hi passed around 100 for the same reason I have a pultec boosting highs & lows on the master- it just ends up doing a lot of work for me.\n\nIt can become problematic if I\u2019ve got big toms in a song and, after I\u2019ve got a mix starting to cook I\u2019ll toggle it on & off to see if I\u2019m doing more harm than good. For the kind of music I mostly do, it works more often than not, but the one song I sent to Cian for mixing he basically blasted me for doing that. (In his own kind and gentle way.)\n\nBut m/s eq isn\u2019t just for the master buss. You can think about it for any stereo track. Sometimes, I have an acoustic that\u2019s carrying the whole song, but the fundamentals are fighting with the vocal, so I\u2019ll turn the mid down at that frequency (or side chain that to the vocal if it feels anemic when the vocal is out.) that leaves the sides as big as you like cause it\u2019s not fighting with my mono vocal.",

I've noticed lately, that when I go God Particle to Fabfilter L2, the sides of the music push out significantly more. I've been getting more clarity in the instrumentation of my mixes. The compromise is less saturation, but I think I like the separation (the fabfilter or Ozone limiter was only ever doing 1-2dB of work, but still completely changing that final spectrum. I'm having trouble telling how soon my mixes overload with the Pro L-2 unfortunately. Do you think wider is better? or is a trick and it's too wide, and all that width is overload? I have trouble detecting overload in my Insight2 Plugin, I only notice it on phone speakers after the fact. any advice to help decide?",

This happens to me from time to time, not always that extreme tho.\n\nGenerally my first move is to listen while bypassing each thing and trying to identify what it\u2019s making better and what gets worse, then if I decide to try and keep some of them I\u2019ll attempt to move some of those plugs off the main mix buss and back onto a subgroup or instrumental buss. But no matter what it ends up with me looping sections and rebuilding the mix to match the rough vibe before I get into the actual creative fun part of the mix.\n\nI have one producer i work with often who mixes into a comp on his all vocal buss and it\u2019s slow and hitting like 3-6 db compression. It totally bones me while mixing so I usually end up rebalancing all the vocals section by section to match his mix before I \u201cstart mixing\u201d. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll just work into their buss shit and bypass the stuff/bands of each of plug that are only hurting and not helping. \n\nReal can of worms tbh. \n\nLast week I ran into the vocal buss issue- luckily it was a comp w side chain input so I did try out the sidechain, I pre fader sent all the tracks feeding it while copying automation to that send, then used a master fader to match the buss sc level to the original comps gain reduction  and it worked well in that situation and untied my hands while saving me from a whole vocal rebalance session. First time that approach ever actually worked though for me tbh. If its a comp that drums are driving into i find the sc input doesnt end up feeling the same usually.",

So the sound i'm hearing is the outcome of all the tracks being processed by this chain, and especially, compressed by the IRON compressor. So If i bounce every single track/stem individually, will they be compressed? When printinting the stems like this they would hit the bus compressor or not? Any ideas?? Thanks in advance ^^",

    "content": "All good it\u2019s a little tricky at first and just really difficult to explain typed out for me.\n\nSame concept as using a sidechain input from a kick drum to duck the 808 - an external sidechain allows us to give the compressor something to listen to and apply the compression from that source to another source.  When the kick is fed to a compressor on your 808 channel - the compressor \u201clistens\u201d to the kick and applies the compression curve from the kick onto the bass.\n\nSo in your case of printing stems with a mix bus compressor - you want the SPL Iron plugin to \u201clisten\u201d to the entire mix as it heard it before but then apply that compression to one track at a time.\n\nWe can do this in Ableton with some clever workarounds, which would be a lot more efficient to show you on a video call on the server if you are free later.  Essentially you need to print a version of your song at each point in your mix bus chain where there are dynamics plugins (just before the Slate plugin, just before the Iron Compressor but after all the other plugins) and then send that audio to those corresponding plugins\u2019 external sidechain inputs and then you can use the \u201cinclude return and master effects\u201d and get the result you are looking for",

Then again multiple times on his website etc. etc. I noticed this phenomenon that after listening to his tracks I would lose interest after about 30 seconds. They would sound great at first - all the tape shit and analog gear and whatnot - but I just consistently lost interest in all his tracks for whatever reason. Couldn't listen to them all the way through... Ran into him at the bar and started talking with him about compression and what compressors he uses on what and blah, blah, blah. To my surprise he's a big fan of compression and uses a lot of them at different stages - I think mostly because he has them and he can. Told me about how he'll have one taking off some and then another taking off some and then the master bus taking off some... I know this is a common technique to have different compressors taking off little bits, and one I've started to employ in the box, but I've concluded that by the time his tracks hit the master they're already pretty \"smooth\" and that master just takes the last edge off them - That's why I lost interest in his songs. Not dynamic enough for my ears. The end. Also, the fact that he only uses one inch tape could have something to do with it. The End.",

Back bus gets compressed more aggressively than I would do a mix bus. Blend that under the mix bus to taste. Really good for locking all the instrumentation together around vocals without dynamics getting pulled around by the drums. I think Andrew uses some kind of 1176 but the idea works with all kinds of compressors.\n\nMix bus and backbus both feed into a 2-bus where more processing may happen.

    "content": "The best mixes i've done (in terms of how they feel and how quickly they get approved) have been since I started with a pretty heavy hand on the mix bus. it keeps me from overprocessing and loading up the session with plugins unnecessarily, and also makes it easier to sort out what parts of the mix are most important. My brain has never liked starting with limiting on for anything but the most aggressive stuff I've done, but I'll probably change my tune on that at some point.",

    "content": "I understand the perspective of (lufs don\u2019t matter) however I want some consistency amongst my songs AND to be sufficiently loud compared to others.\n\nI am competent of achieving very loud mixes however the introduction of artifacts bothers me. Usually I\u2019m low passing with ISOL8 to listen for limiting/clipping clicks. These artifacts are unable to be heard unless I have a low pass filter active but I theorize that they, along with the extreme compression subconsciously degrade the listening experience by discretely assaulting your ears to the point of needing to take a break from listening. \n\nMy music can be related sonically to clara la sans \u201canother night\u201d give or take more or less busy. (Keep in mind her stuff is cranked to the point of audible artifacts sitting around -7ish lufs integrated across the chorus).\n\nI arrange the mix well and leave 1db of headroom for summing on individual instruments whilst they are loud enough for my target of -10 LUFi across the chorus, meaning my mix is actually 1db louder than -10 with space to sum on the pre master bus. Leaving headroom means I can introduce less artifacts at the cost of having to squeeze the dynamic range of individual instruments more than otherwise.\n\nMy issue is that If I want to aim for let\u2019s say -8LUFSi across the chorus in a relatively clean way with minimal artifacts, I\u2019m forced to squeeze the mix to -7.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear y\u2019all thoughts on whether or not technically inaudible artifacts/distortion matter and whether or not it\u2019s really worth for me to squeeze my mix 2db more in the name of competitive loudness?\n\nPs. Please bear with me as I am trying to figure this all out solo. Feel free to criticize my approach.",
