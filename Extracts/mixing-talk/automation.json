    "content": "imho, a lot of the vocals I'm hearing from younger record makers are sounding heavily  processed in the same way. \"Lack of dynamics\" doesn't really explain it because people think of dynamics as dynamic range compression. It's more that everyone is chopping, clip gaining, and RXing to an evenness that softens and linearizes performances. \n\nThese tools work beautifully when shitty mic technique makes things boomy, or there's a few weird ss's on the pre-hyped TLM mic through the focusrite pre.\n\nBut it sounds like most people who learn the tools are overusing them like crazy. \n\nI'm trying these days to get off the details and try as much macro-mixing as possible. When I let performances breathe in their imperfections, I find that I'm drawn in more as a listener.\n\n\"Music is the space between the notes\". \n-Claude Debussy\n\n\"Music is the space between RX moves.\" \n-Ruair\u00ed (probably)",

The monthly tailspin, I know it well \ud83d\ude02\n\nOne thing that I have found to be very helpful to reduce masking / increase clarity  is to simply start by going track to track and listening for / EQing out non musical resonances and non-musical buildups. \n\nI am definitely NOT suggesting the aggressive hyper notching you see in a lot of YouTube tutorials, but a general track to track cleanup of obvious issues. Don\u2019t over think it, only attack the obvious things \n\nHypothetical Examples:\n- weird 1.5k resonant ring in the hats and overheads\u2026notch that thing down a bit. You\u2019d be surprised how much space that takes up in a dense mix. \n- high lead guitar part with extraneous rumble at 200hz\u2026not contributing to the musicality of the part\u2026byeeee\n- piano building up at 300hz in the choruses when everything is competing for midrange - automate EQ in chorus to create space \n\n\nEtc etc etc. \n\nSmall moves like that have made some of the biggest differences for me. Definitely not the fanciest tip, but simple EQ moves have been the biggest contributor to midrange clarity for me.",

    "content": "shifting gears for a sec - something i've been a big fan of this year is duplicating a lead vocal and stripping back any compression / dynamic control to a secondary track with no output, then putting any reverb sends on that track instead of the main ldv. this saves pretty much any instinctual reverb automation \"throws\" and the such because the vocals natural dynamic is lighting up the reverb the same way it would in real life. it now strikes me how odd and unnatural it would sound to have a vocal hitting the reverb about as hard during soft moments as during dynamic moments. unfortunately there are many cases where this is simply not possible as i'm already starting with a heavily compressed vocal. maybe i'm late to this, but anybody else do this or something similar with success?",

If something is loud at the very beginning of a section, then comes back down in volume, the ear will perceive it to be loud for the section. So quickly automating drums + cymbals, big piano chords, guitars, etc -- just for a moment -- will go a long way at making sections exciting. I'm also a fan of slowly lowering the volume of certain instruments right before section changes to give the perception of loudness and excitement on the downbeat.",

    "content": "Mind if I ramble? I'm working on what is probably the most challenging mix I've done this year. I've been at my first pass for close to 2 weeks, and have probably started it over 4 times. For context, it's a very dense country rock song with like 80-90 tracks, heavy heavy buss processing, many layers hitting exceptional stages of compression and saturation. The most challenging part is that, despite my philosophical differences from the producer's template, the rough mix really works. Anytime I try to strip it back, import my template, do my own thing, make the mix fit into my \"mixing philosophy\", it just falls apart. I've considered stemming it out with Bounce Factory through his template to then put the tracks into my template, but that would be a zero sum game I can already expect to lose. \n\nUltimately I've had to shift my perspective of wondering \"why am I here?\" I'm learning that my role is not to run this song through some proprietary process I take pride in, but to simply just help them reach the finish line by trying to understand and continue within the process they've already deeply baked this song through. I've found that I can apply my perspective while setting my \"process\" aside, and explore what small tweaks or decisions I *can* make that get us the last couple % we might be missing. Any previous approach I've tried I already know would result in a 10+ revision nightmare trying to get back to the original magic of the rough.\n\nAnd on the interpersonal front, I've decided against sharing any of this struggle with the artist. Maybe the mix that gets approved of the 4 that I've done is the one I spent 30 minutes on, but the many hours of me feeling like I'm \"failing\" on the other 3 passes were needed to understand that this track only needed 30 minutes of my time. Excuses don't get us to the finish line. \n\nWhat has been your experience in these situations?",

    "content": "i learned something new about Soothe yesterday that I found valuable - the \"soft\" vs \"hard\" mode doesn't affect ratio so much as it affects how the threshold behaves. Soft has what I understand to be a \"smart\" floating threshold that kind of rides the signal, versus hard is closer to a fixed threshold (and I believe depth then affects the ratio and threshold in it's own way). So, if you were trying to zone in on a frequency that only occasionally rears it's head, hard mode with a lower depth will be generally more accurate and not affect the other parts of the audio nearly as much. I don't like using Soothe on sibilance, but I actually found it quite effective after learning this by setting it to hard mode with a very broad \"sharpness\".",

I\u2019ll duplicate this track (without inserts), maybe end up with 4 of them with different FX chains. It\u2019s no biggie just for a H-Delay and a vintageverb/metaflanger/ whatever.\n\nLike they mentioned on the podcast, this method encourages more experimentation for me, and also circumvents niggly things like trying to get a word to echo on the downbeat if it was sung on an offbeat - you just move the clip forward or backward in time. And if an Ess is too apparent, you can clip gain it down in the source etc.\n\nPlus once you have your verb throw set, when you in turn commit that throw, whatever it is about seeing the audio just suggests further details like having it cut abruptly on a beat, or reverse it, or fade it in, or EQ it etc.",

This lets you place the instrument in the stereo field of the reverb. Doing it with mondo mod allows you to keep it static but also automate movement (small or large) within the verb \ud83d\ude42\n\nAnother idea:\nUse Waves StudioVerse (or similar plugin that allows this routing)\n-parallel split the dry/wet \n-wet gets what ever verb you want\n-Leave the wet panned out-wide\n-pan the dry in towards the middle \n\nDoing it with StudioVerse allows you to avoid making aux-sends and keep it all on the track level. (Very useful on bgvs)\n\nLast idea:\nUse a pan control plugin (S1, TrackControl, etc) after the verb so you can make it more mono if you want. \n\nI love verb/dly haha thanks for letting me talk  about it here\u2026my wife is tired of hearing about it \ud83e\udd72",

Is that right?\n\nMoving mountains to frame music in the best light, irregardless of the quality of source material, is part of the game, but I wonder if you've chosen a misaligned exercise to hone your chops.\n\nClip gain is a wonderful and simple tool. If a peak offends the ear, then you can clip gain it down. If a lyric is lost or hard to hear, then you can clip gain it up. There are useful work flow adjustments we could maybe talk about, but it really is that simple. Listen to the music. How does it make you feel. Adjust accordingly.",

From there you learn how and when to break it (I like boosting the 200hz-ish body of a live snare drum into a parallel compressor/ saturator to solidify and have control of that frequency range, automate it for fills, etc.).\n\nIMO this is a great \"rule,\" which is great to learn and then break all the time.",

    "content": "- The classic example of compression is to use a fast release with something like a parallel drum buss. As the release lets go and brings up the room gain you get this urgent and explosive energy. When the room is good, and the compression timing is set right it can really make things sound bigger than real life. Remember we're trying to tell a story here, we can't jam the *actual* real power and size of stadium rock drums into that mono speaker at Target but listen to Paradise City and it tells the story pretty well ... our brain does an amazing job of filling in the rest\n\n- The last example is using something like a good tube compressor on vocals. With a nice soft knee and lots of gain reduction we get bring up a bunch of low level and emotional detail, breathy whispery stuff at the end of lines etc that can really help a lyric connect. Often with something like a good tube compressor we get a healthy amount of harmonic distortion too along for the ride which adds weight to the vocal and draws the listeners attention",

But that's also because it's not trying to be the best mixing platform. It does a *lot* of things that make it preferable from a writing/arranging perspective, and that far outweighs the cons.\n\nI wish it had EUCON support, because it's hard to get hi-res fader rides from controllers without it. Best I can do is do rides with MIDI values (only 128 values). My solution to this has been to map a MIDI fader to a *Utility* gain plugin and limit the range of the fader move to +/- 6dB so that I can get a good resolution with it across the range of volumes that I want to automate. But that's a pain in the ass.\n\nThat said, there's one feature of Ableton that I really miss when I use other DAW's and that's the *Audio Effect Rack* device. I use these *all* the time for so many things like parallel processing, or quickly disabling entire FX chains. They are incredibly useful and they remove the need to mult-out three extra channels to do parallel FX (like you would in Pro Tools).",

So dynamics and sonic interest are your friend. If you can find ways to create contrast and change over 30 second intervals that will go a long way towards engaging the listener.

Go wild and see what inspires them! Make it into a performance and vibe off of the noise.

It may sound like too much when the verb return is loud but when you sink the verb down it usually is really effective for me.\n\nI like to use a mono aux with a delay plug-in for predelays, with a bus as the input and a bus to the verb as the output. No predelay on the verb itself, you make it before hand on this aux. Reason for this being you have a lot of control on your send signal that only the verb hears. A midrangey verb and a full range dry vocal make for depth and texture that can peacefully co exist. You can de ess the send harder than the real LV. With this pre delay aux you can make the send signal darker or brighter. If the song calls for it, make a second aux and have multiple predelays feeding the same verb. For example, a 16th with no feedback that is 80% wet, and a second input bus to same output bus that is dark 1/4 note 100% wet and with feedback where you can automate the send to that long feedback predelay and leave the short no feedback 1/16 static. You can get a lot of mileage out of the same verb with these multiple pre delays and provide some cohesive varied space.",

Usually the higher notes are just higher so they naturally don\u2019t have sub/super low end info, which I\u2019d say is more an arrangement issue than mix issue, if the track feels empty in the low end down there during the parts the bass is up high and it was unintentional.

Starting with the biggest section of the song helps as well. I can then automate the other sections up or down *including the master fader feeding the 2bus*  As far as clipping/limiting on sources/busses I find it good to shape the sounds how I want (more heavy lifting) then the busses/2bus end up just glueing it together with a lighter touch.

    "content": "I have two thoughts on this. One is to use balance (often fader automation) to bring attention to a particular track moment by moment. Maybe multiple midrange elements will be competing, but the ear can only focus on one at a time (in addition to the drums, bass, and maybe vocal) so YOU choose and shift the focus!\n\nMy second approach is to take two or more of the competing tracks, say kick and bass, and play them together. No point in soloing one. EQ one while listening through it to the other. You may notice that you can subtract quite a bit from the bass without losing its character, but the kick\u2019s punch is improved by the space you\u2019re carving out. I do this a lot with vocals, too\u2014focusing on the vocal inside a dense mix while subtracting from all the other stuff that\u2019s stepping on it. When the lead just finds its home in its own uncongested space, you know you\u2019ve got all the surrounding noise right.",

I felt like I was getting a little too pristine and, as @BatMeckley said, *flat* with my mixes, and putting the whole song on a few faders, closing all the PT windows, and listening and reacting has been a great trick to play on my brain to just listen to the song and pick out special moments. Often I\u2019ll realize that certain elements can ride down before chorus downbeats/ride up on those downbeats in the process of doing this, and then it\u2019s super easy to execute (and more fun than drawing in a line of automation).",

We\u2019re still on this learning journey so happy for any pushback or insight\n\nFor the most part, our group felt the tradeoffs of very subtle multiband often outweigh the benefits, since just putting those crossovers in the signal makes a bigger difference than, say, a dB of control.\n\nWe felt more liberal use of multiband can add an aggression and excitement that is very familiar and unique, and prefer treating it as a sweetener or energizer over the whole mix more than trying to control problem areas that could be addressed on tracks.\n\nIn the signal chain, its position can drastically effect how other tools behave. Up front, it can help a bus compressor or saturation device behave more predictably, but may mush things too much. Near the end, it allows those devices to play a more colorful role but may cause weird behavior when using fast, \u201ctransparent\u201d limiters afterward. I like it first right now, most of our group like it near the end.\n\nThe hallmark signs of overuse for us were mixes that sound overly strident or when a vocal becomes inconsistent tonally from section to section as density changes.\n\nTools-wise, the group unanimously preferred minimum phase tools over linear phase or dynamic phase. OTT is a starting point, ear training to recognize that color. Once you hear it at 15-20%, you won\u2019t be able to unhear it on many pop records. After ingraining that color, ML4000 and C4 both have their own flavors that can do a thing while offering tweakability when needed.",

Especially something like upright bass, resonances can push things around wildly in level and the solution could be a simple move away.",

    "content": "I\u2019ve got nothing against using compression and Eq and that\u2019s typically what I would do for something like this. But this specific case was really giving me a hard time. Lowest note on this upright track was hitting about 7db louder than the higher notes. Sounds like the mic was close up to the body/ f hole and not getting enough of the neck. After trying different EQ + compression techniques, automation just sounded a bit more pleasing to my ears. And made it easier to stick with the up and down dynamics of the song. Which is also very up and down. I could compress then ride a fader to match the track, but either way I\u2019m automating. This song is more in the chamber music world and super dynamic, so EQ / compression moves I would do on other stuff felt more aggressive.",

A compressor doesn\u2019t differentiate between a word or phrase that should stand out from the others. That\u2019s why he uses clip gain to level out stuff beforehand. \n\nOfcourse you can make the point of leveling out with a compressor and then automating up poignant words or phrases. But most modern vocal recordings have to be edited anyway so why not go in and do it all there?",

In particular if there is arrangement automation. I\u2019m not trying to re do what they already like. But if it\u2019s not working for me I\u2019ll re do it. I have a template that has my busses routed and then I get organize and color code. Small sessions take about 15 mins to  prep and bigger sessions about 30 mins max.  If I can I prefer to prep before I plan to mix incase there are any issues with files ect. Sometimes I have an assistant doing it for me. Then I go to town",

    "content": "@popaganda. Very much here for this #console-content. I have two approaches for console mixing:\nA) Keep it on the console. Usually means keeping it on the board for a few days while people chime in with their input. Usually the band will be on board with this workflow and understand that part of the magic of this workflow is to commit to things and make decisions quickly. I was working on a console with automation, so that was useful for fine-tuning a mix by modern standards\u2026 but not impossible with static faders.\nB) Have enough I/O and set each console channel as an insert in Pro Tools. This was the hybrid workflow that really worked for me. It was also the gateway to integrating outboard gear. When something needed the console treatment, I\u2019d add the insert, get it vibing in the mix, and then once I was ready to print a pass, I\u2019d commit all the inserts in real time. The session was getting summed in the box and everything came up perfectly for recalls. This was a great way of getting the sound and workflow but staying sane in the modern record making world.",

It\u2019s sort of like a left handed guitarist that only had a right handed guitar so they learned all the chords up side down.   One thing I know  is he spends a lot of time finding where every little thing can sit in a mix and usually gets rid of information that doesn\u2019t need to be there. He also mixes into heavy limiting. Which then often you have to re creat dynamics, master buss rides etc",

I thought what I\u2019d been given wasn\u2019t good enough to get what I wanted . The turning point for me was realising I had started mixing the songs before I knew the parts , the nuance and strengths and weakness of the performances of those parts and the arrangements of them intimately . I didn\u2019t know all the vocalists lyrics or know the parts of their vocal range that distorted and those that sat perfectly . I realised I was effectively driving a car with my eyes shut . \nMy best offer would be : make sure you know everything inside out , and then mix again from scratch \u2026and with old school good balances and fader rides I bet you can bring it to life . \n\nIn knowing every aspect of the performances I was able to anticipate the parts and really bring the interplay of the band to life in the mix properly . Kinda felt that was the key that unlocked the potential that I\u2019d not found before \n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d",

To go into some of your questions; I'm using Adam a7's (not the newer a7x's, although I tested them and they're wasn't as much of a difference as I had expected in my room). My room has been treated with diy panels, 14cm thick Rockwool and it sounds decent for a home recording studio. the dimensions aren't great and low lend monitoring isn't top of the charts but it's workable. Any peaks and valleys i did have have been sorted out further as much as possible with sonarworks which has really outdone my expectations. I also use Beyerdynamics dt770 pro's. \nUsually a lot of time does actually go into clip gaining, cleaning up and taking harshness out of vocals. I often take as much time just manually leveling a vocal, taking out esses etc as I do mixing. Fresh air and dopamine have indeed been big helpers and have been big steps towards that sizzle. Also the waves exciter in parallel has been working okay.\nI never seem to be able to get a multiband compressor to work well. Either I'm overdoing some of the setting or something because often i feel like it attenuates too much and other times to little in the places I want it to. I've noticed that a little boost in the low mids on pro-q3 that then also attenuates dynamically can work. \nCould you go into a bit more detail on what you mean with phase bringing a vocal more forward?\nI've also noticed that a lot of the sound I'm looking for comes from a certain sort of rolling kind of sound that might be coming from the rappers throat? I'm not sure at all about this but it seems like it's almost vocal fry but in a very natural way that is inherent to the singers/rappers voice. Idk if this is a rapping technique thing or if this is more accentuated in the mixing process, but it sounds really nice.\nDefinitely a big thankyou for all the tips!",

I\u2019m curious- When Jon is mixing down is he running his vocals out then back in then out and in again with the rest of the mix from the 2bus, all in real time? I\u2019m a little confused how that would work with latency.. maybe he is committing the fern or unfairchild on the vocals at some point, once he\u2019s got his ess and sibilants clip gained and then proceeds with the rest of the mix and dialing in the hardware and plugs on the 2bus.

    "content": "I can relate to this . I think first impression notes are a great tool and I\u2019m challenging myself to \u201cdo less \u201c not more to roughs:demos . Often times when I\u2019m tracking vocals it is to a two track (rnb/hip-hop) and I\u2019ve learnt that just about any \u201cvocal sound \u201c I want to go for I better get it whilst we are tracking because the artists always want a rough vocal mix to go away with at end of session . Invariably , whatever that rough sounds like I can\u2019t stray away from (for good or bad ) once they\u2019ve heard it . And then when it comes to a final mix , it gets even more complicated getting the actual stems for the two track and mixing it all down with the vocal tracks as it often (imo) sounds better but doesn\u2019t feel the same as that on the day rough vocal mix to the two track . I realised there\u2019s no way I can get an artist to unhear that first  rough mix and I\u2019m wasting hours mixing it all over again with the stems , like I\u2019m re inventing a wheel no one wants . I\u2019ve noticed @Bainz_  telling @oaklandmatt he had the same issues with thugs punk album and also have heard Jason Goldberg and Stuart white embracing the idea that you\u2019re possibly mixing the final mix/pre master as you track . It\u2019s a very raw and quick approach and it does keep you miles away from overmixing something . I embraced it as a workflow only recently and it\u2019s less stressful than working your ass off on a \u201cperfect\u201d mix only to get back they prefer the vibe of the first day mix .   top tips not to overmix I am meditating on currently are : don\u2019t lose your dynamics , watch your phase relationships don\u2019t change , leave some mistakes in , automate more than compress and be quick",

Or if the other instruments are doing things that aren\u2019t meaningful to the arrangement, it can get contribute to bass notes getting lost as well. \nTry muting other stuff one at a time until you can hear the bass well, and evaluate why the bass isn\u2019t cutting through. \n\nSometimes, you just gotta zoom out and mute the bass and mix the song without the bass and put it in. Before you do this, save as and solo vocals (if there is any) bass and drums (sometimes one other most important/prominent element in the arrangement on top of that) and make that work first. You can get it to a point of making the mix work this way if there is one element that just doesn\u2019t sit well in the mix.",

As an outsider to the major label stuff , it often sounds to me like stuff is pushed way way too hard and comes across as insecure .

So other things need to be done like parameter automation and layering\n\nBass guitar is probably not gonna have as consistent in your face subs like 808s, but the life of it always felt more massive than 808 to me. \n\nSoft synths sound huge on their own because they have very consistent presence but when you turn the faders down for balance, it gets smaller again. So  as many mentioned it takes making it smaller to make it bigger again. I guess this also applies to distorted guitars",

Sometimes just a compressor directly on the channel will do something similar and less dramatic than ducking if that\u2019s what is needed for the song, \n\nAlso I find faders very helpful in automating effects. Because I don\u2019t always want them to duck in the same shape or ducking is something I\u2019d do to change the nature of the tail and will still need some additional shaping to give specialness to different moments.\n\nFor vocals I like copying the audio track and make separate fx tracks because I only want it on certain words. Even for overall effect, I use a separate track so I can take out certain words from reverb or clip gain them.

I mixed the whole thing in one Pro Tools session, with a separate set of channels for each song which I\u2019d then make inactive and move onto the next song. When printing the continuous mix at the end, I\u2019d make active two songs at a time for any overlap, and constructed the long printed mix like that.\n\nIn this case though, there are multimiced drums, bass, electric guitars, keyboards, vocals. The recordings are good (from the stereo board mixes I\u2019ve heard) and the scale is such that I want to have the fidelity I\u2019d approach a studio record with, and the room to shape an identity for each song (while still sounding like they all happened on the same stage on the same night) so I\u2019m thinking to use my usual elaborate drum mix routing with parallels etc, all the bells and whistles.\n\nThis complexity would put me off mixing 23 songs in one session, but I\u2019m thinking of the inevitable crunch at the end of the project and the potential frustration of jumping between sessions.\n\nAm I thinking too deeply about this? Should I just get a drum sound and leave it there for 23 tracks, with a few rides here and there?\n\nNot much experience with this stuff so any thoughts would be very welcome please!",

It\u2019s basically a group volume ride for frequencies instead of tracks. You can also do this on individual stereo tracks if just panning isn\u2019t granular enough. \n\nThe why & when is mostly about taste. I tend to mix into a proQ3 setting that has the sides hi passed around 100 for the same reason I have a pultec boosting highs & lows on the master- it just ends up doing a lot of work for me.\n\nIt can become problematic if I\u2019ve got big toms in a song and, after I\u2019ve got a mix starting to cook I\u2019ll toggle it on & off to see if I\u2019m doing more harm than good. For the kind of music I mostly do, it works more often than not, but the one song I sent to Cian for mixing he basically blasted me for doing that. (In his own kind and gentle way.)\n\nBut m/s eq isn\u2019t just for the master buss. You can think about it for any stereo track. Sometimes, I have an acoustic that\u2019s carrying the whole song, but the fundamentals are fighting with the vocal, so I\u2019ll turn the mid down at that frequency (or side chain that to the vocal if it feels anemic when the vocal is out.) that leaves the sides as big as you like cause it\u2019s not fighting with my mono vocal.",

    "content": "Re clip gain, i really agree with a lot of this, esp as someone who went way too far down the clip gain rabbit hole. \n\nI forgot who said the melodyne \u201cautomated clip gain\u201d macro tool was a massive part of their workflow, but I\u2019ve noticed that if I\u2019m going too far beyond that level of adjustment i just get into a messy territory. A good process that I\u2019ve found helpful is clip gain, tune + macro volume adjust with melodyne, clip gain again if it\u2019s still needed.\n\nThe multi band thing is intriguing. I admittedly use it on the midrange of the vocals pretty sparingly. I think it\u2019s all case dependent but I definitely love using MB on a dense production.",

This happens to me from time to time, not always that extreme tho.\n\nGenerally my first move is to listen while bypassing each thing and trying to identify what it\u2019s making better and what gets worse, then if I decide to try and keep some of them I\u2019ll attempt to move some of those plugs off the main mix buss and back onto a subgroup or instrumental buss. But no matter what it ends up with me looping sections and rebuilding the mix to match the rough vibe before I get into the actual creative fun part of the mix.\n\nI have one producer i work with often who mixes into a comp on his all vocal buss and it\u2019s slow and hitting like 3-6 db compression. It totally bones me while mixing so I usually end up rebalancing all the vocals section by section to match his mix before I \u201cstart mixing\u201d. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll just work into their buss shit and bypass the stuff/bands of each of plug that are only hurting and not helping. \n\nReal can of worms tbh. \n\nLast week I ran into the vocal buss issue- luckily it was a comp w side chain input so I did try out the sidechain, I pre fader sent all the tracks feeding it while copying automation to that send, then used a master fader to match the buss sc level to the original comps gain reduction  and it worked well in that situation and untied my hands while saving me from a whole vocal rebalance session. First time that approach ever actually worked though for me tbh. If its a comp that drums are driving into i find the sc input doesnt end up feeling the same usually.",

There's also the question of more granular clip gain for de-essing or plosives, etc., that makes me wonder what would be overdoing it or what is even needed and how to judge that.\n\nUsually any \"mixing\" or editing I do is related to ideas I create or am part of capturing and have vision/inspiration and get some level of enjoyment out of it. This inspiration usually provides intention or some direction even in my ignorance. In this case I'm completely detached and uninspired essentially, while this makes me more objective, I have a hard time hearing where I want to take the vocal. \n\nI would appreciate some perspective and insight into the granular thought process one might take with the source material I have, having more experience and know-how. I will push through on my own and seek out feedback that way as well, but some live soundboarding would be nice. I appreciate you regardless if you read this and if you have any input at all. ty!!\n\nIf you are interested in listening or discussing it, ping or DM me.

    "content": "Yes, I agree. Pro-DS just isn't good enough. I bought Apulsoft's SplitS last week and it's just such an improvement, and much closer in result, if not workflow, to manual de-essing. It's also possible to split vocals into tonal and sibilant info over two tracks. I think this will end up being my workflow so that I can easily automate and adjust each ess without having to clip gain, clip fx it manually. Worth every penny.",

A part of my growth as a mixer has been accepting that my contribution can be objectively very small but still valuable nonetheless. An above average producer\u2019s time is better spent working on another song. I can take a lot off their plate spending an extra hour on EQ, another hour going deep on vocal automation/edit cleanup. That can feel priceless to a busy producer/artist team.",
