# Mogami Cables

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Mogami is a Japanese cable manufacturer considered a studio standard alongside Canare. The W2549 is the cable stock used in Mogami's "Gold Series" pre-made cables with Neutrik terminations, while the 2932 is their multi-pair snake cable. Community discussions reveal that while Mogami is well-regarded and widely used, cable differences at this level are extremely marginal -- comparisons with Grimm and other premium cables showed differences that are "very much 'yeah whatever'" territory. Mogami is practical, sounds great, and is easier to work with than some alternatives like Grimm, making it a sensible default choice for patchbay wiring and studio cabling.

## Key Characteristics

- **W2549 used in Gold Series cables** -- Mogami's standard mic cable; pre-made Gold Series with Neutrik XLR runs about $95 for 25 feet
- **DIY cost is much lower** -- a 25-foot cable with W2549 and premium Neutrik connectors costs roughly $28 to build
- **2932 multi-pair snake cable** -- used for patchbay and multi-channel wiring; copper shield can be tedious to trim
- **Rubberized outer coating** -- some prefer Grimm's lay vs. Mogami's more rubberized feel
- **Differences vs. competitors are marginal** -- blind comparisons between Mogami, Grimm, and Sommer showed differences that are real but practically irrelevant
- **Easier to work with than Grimm** -- Grimm's braided shielding is harder to solder; Mogami is more practical for patchbay wiring
- **Industry standard** -- used in studios worldwide; a safe default choice

## Use Cases

- **Studio patchbay wiring** -- Mogami 2932 multi-pair for bulk patchbay builds
- **Mic cables** -- W2549 with Neutrik connectors is the go-to build
- **Monitor path cabling** -- adequate for monitoring; some mastering engineers prefer Grimm but the difference is minimal
- **DIY cable building** -- popular choice for engineers who build their own cables to save money

## Comparable Alternatives

| Cable Brand | Price | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| [[Canare Cables]] L-2T2S | Slightly cheaper | Braided shielding; arguably more durable; comparable sound |
| Grimm | More expensive | Slightly preferred by some mastering engineers; harder to solder |
| Sommer | Similar | Some prefer its sound; differences are truly marginal |
| Van Damme | ~$3.19/meter | Well-regarded UK alternative |
| Audio Note | Significantly more | Actually better per some users; but money is generally better spent elsewhere |

## Common Mistakes

- **Spending too much on premium cables before addressing other weaknesses** -- room treatment, monitors, and converters will make a far bigger difference than cable upgrades
- **Assuming pre-made Mogami Gold is dramatically better than DIY** -- you are paying for convenience, not superior sound
- **Fighting copper shield strands on 2932 snakes** -- the outer shield on multi-pair cable is tedious; budget extra time or pay someone to build them
