# Neutrik Connectors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Neutrik is the industry-standard manufacturer of professional XLR, TRS, and other audio connectors used in cable building and studio wiring. The community references Neutrik connectors as the default choice for quality cable builds, paired with Mogami or Canare cable stock. While Neutrik XLR connectors are universally praised, their TRS patchbay panels receive criticism for being difficult to work with when changing normals or swapping cables in tight spaces. The gold-plated Neutrik XLR jacks are the premium option but add to cable build cost.

## Key Characteristics

- **Industry standard for XLR connectors** -- the default choice for professional cable builds worldwide
- **Gold-plated option available** -- premium gold-plated jacks add a few dollars per connector; used in Mogami Gold Series cables
- **TRS patchbays are problematic** -- Neutrik TRS patchbay panels described as "brutal" and "total cheeks" for cable management
- **Great for DIY cable building** -- paired with Mogami W2549 or Canare L-2T2S for affordable, professional-quality cables
- **Available at multiple price points** -- standard nickel connectors are affordable; gold-plated are premium
- **XLR cables easy to build** -- described as a "cakewalk" compared to TRS or DB25

## Use Cases

- **DIY cable building** -- the go-to connector for building custom XLR cables with Mogami or Canare cable
- **Studio wiring** -- standard connector for all XLR-terminated connections in professional environments
- **Patchbay wiring** -- while Neutrik TRS panels exist, community generally prefers DB25 or E3-backed patchbays

## Comparable Alternatives

| Connector Brand | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| Switchcraft | Alternative for XLR; some prefer for specific applications |
| Amphenol | Budget alternative; adequate quality |
| Redco | Patchbay manufacturer using various connector standards |
| E3 | Preferred patchbay connector format; per-channel changes possible |

## Common Mistakes

- **Choosing Neutrik TRS patchbays for large installations** -- changing normals on Neutrik TRS panels once installed is extremely tedious; DB25 or E3 panels are better
- **Over-spending on gold-plated connectors** -- the sonic difference is negligible; standard Neutrik connectors perform just fine
- **Not budgeting enough connectors** -- cable building projects always need more connectors than you think
