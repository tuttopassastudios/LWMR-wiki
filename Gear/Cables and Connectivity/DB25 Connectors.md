# DB25 Connectors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> DB25 (D-sub 25-pin) connectors are multi-channel analog audio connectors that carry 8 balanced channels per cable, widely used in professional studios for patchbay wiring, converter connections, and rack gear integration. The community strongly recommends DB25-based patchbays (from Switchcraft or Redco) over soldered TRS patchbays for their ease of installation and long-term reliability. DB25 patchbays have been described as lasting 12+ years without issues, and the connector eliminates the need for individual cable soldering. The trade-off is that cables are more expensive and everything comes in groups of 8.

## Key Characteristics

- **8 balanced channels per cable** -- carries four stereo pairs or eight mono channels on a single connector
- **DB25-to-XLR fan-out snakes** -- the most common configuration; allows adapting to individual XLR connections
- **Switchcraft and Redco patchbays recommended** -- both brands praised for reliability; Switchcraft considered the standard
- **No soldering required** -- plug-and-play installation eliminates the biggest headache of patchbay wiring
- **XLR DB25s preferred** -- get XLR-terminated fan-outs and adapt with XLR-to-1/4" shorties if needed for TRS gear
- **Everything in groups of 8** -- can be a headache when your gear doesn't divide evenly into 8-channel groups
- **Cables are expensive** -- DB25 snakes cost significantly more than individual patch cables; "pay too much for cables, and have it"
- **Elco connectors for larger installations** -- for bigger studio builds, elco/EDAC connectors may be more practical than DB25

## Use Cases

- **Patchbay wiring for home and project studios** -- the standard recommendation for anyone setting up a patchbay with outboard gear
- **Connecting DB25-equipped interfaces** -- Apollo x16, Antelope Orion 32, Lynx Aurora all use DB25
- **Studio installations** -- professional standard for wiring racks of converters and outboard
- **Avoiding the soldering nightmare** -- if you are a parent or otherwise short on time, DB25 patchbays save enormous labor

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Switchcraft DB25 patchbays with XLR fan-out cables are the community-recommended configuration
- Keep a few XLR-to-1/4" TRS adapters on hand for connecting TRS-only gear
- Samson TRS patchbays are a reasonable alternative for smaller setups (under 8 channels of outboard)
- Pro Audio LA offers custom/bulk cable orders at decent prices

## Comparable Alternatives

| Connector Type | Notes |
|---------------|-------|
| TRS Patchbay | Cheaper cables; harder to change normals; fine for small setups |
| Elco/EDAC | Better for larger installations; per-channel changes without moving 8 at once |
| E3 Connectors | Easier to prep than DB25; cheaper; allows per-channel changes; underrated |
| XLR Direct | No patchbay; simple but inflexible |

## Common Mistakes

- **Trying to solder your own DB25 cables** -- described as "one of the dumbest things I've ever done" and "pure insanity"; just buy pre-made snakes
- **Getting TRS DB25 fan-outs when XLR would be more versatile** -- XLR can adapt to TRS easily, but not vice versa
- **Not considering E3 or elco for larger builds** -- DB25 in groups of 8 can be awkward; E3 and elco allow per-channel changes
