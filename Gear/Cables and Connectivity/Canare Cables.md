# Canare Cables

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Canare is a Japanese cable manufacturer that competes directly with Mogami as a studio standard. The L-2T2S is their most commonly discussed model, featuring braided shielding that is arguably more durable than Mogami's spiral-wound shield. Community members who build their own cables frequently choose Canare with Neutrik connectors as a cost-effective, high-quality combination. Canare cable is slightly cheaper than Mogami while offering comparable or superior durability, making it a practical choice for studios wiring patchbays, building mic cables, and running multi-channel snakes.

## Key Characteristics

- **L-2T2S is the standard model** -- two-conductor with braided shield; the Canare equivalent of Mogami W2549
- **Braided shielding** -- arguably superior to Mogami's spiral-wound shield for durability and EMI rejection
- **Slightly cheaper than Mogami** -- saves roughly $6 per 25-foot cable build compared to Mogami W2549
- **Paired with Neutrik connectors** -- the standard DIY combination for professional-quality cables
- **Building cables saves significant money** -- a Canare + Neutrik XLR cable costs roughly $22 to build vs. $95 for pre-made Mogami Gold
- **Sonically equivalent to Mogami** -- no meaningful audible difference between the two at this quality level
- **About 15 minutes per cable to build** -- reasonable time investment for significant cost savings

## Use Cases

- **DIY cable building** -- the budget-conscious alternative to Mogami for studio cables
- **Patchbay wiring** -- bulk Canare cable for wiring DB25, TRS, or E3 patchbays
- **Mic cables** -- L-2T2S with Neutrik XLR for daily studio use
- **Cost-sensitive bulk wiring** -- when wiring an entire studio, the per-cable savings add up significantly

## Comparable Alternatives

| Cable Brand | Price | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| [[Mogami Cables]] W2549 | Slightly more | Spiral-wound shield; industry default; rubber coating |
| Grimm | More expensive | Preferred by some mastering engineers; harder to solder |
| Sommer | Similar | German alternative; differences are marginal |
| Van Damme | ~$3.19/meter | UK standard; well-regarded |
| Hosa (pre-made) | Cheapest | Adequate for the price; lower quality components |

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming more expensive cable sounds better** -- at the Canare/Mogami quality level, audible differences are negligible
- **Not investing in a decent soldering iron** -- cable building quality depends heavily on clean solder joints
- **Buying pre-made cables at premium prices** -- if you can solder, building with Canare and Neutrik saves substantial money over pre-made options
