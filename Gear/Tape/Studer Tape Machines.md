# Studer Tape Machines

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Studer represents the pinnacle of professional tape machine design, with the A800 multitrack being the gold standard. Ironically, the A800 and other high-end Studer machines were designed to have minimal sonic coloration — the opposite of what many associate with "tape sound." Studer also made highly praised mixing consoles (169, 269, 963) that are more common in Europe. The company's heritage continues through PSI Audio, which was founded by former Studer engineers.

## Key Characteristics

- **A800**: The definitive professional multitrack tape machine; designed for transparency
- Studer consoles (169, 269, 963) are highly praised but documentation is scarce
- Very common in European studios, less so in North America
- Swiss engineering and build quality
- PSI Audio monitors originated from Studer engineers
- VintageTools is a known restoration company for Studer equipment with spare parts
- Should not be operated on their side — designed for upright orientation (for large machines)

## Use Cases

- Professional multitrack recording at the highest level
- Master tape machine for album projects
- Sync master in multi-machine setups (A800 as transport master via Adams Smith Zeta III)
- Studio consoles for tracking and mixing

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- A800 as transport master driving both multitrack machines and Pro Tools simultaneously
- Zeta III synchronizer for reliable multi-machine sync
- Timecode striped onto one track for synchronization

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Ampex Tape Machines\|Ampex MM1200]] | American professional multitrack; different sonic character |
| [[MCI Tape Machines]] | American alternative; different EQ character |
| [[Otari Tape Machines\|Otari MTR-90]] | Japanese professional multitrack |
| 3M tape machines | Another high-end option designed for transparency |
| [[Tascam]] | Budget alternative for getting "tape sound" |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting the A800 to add heavy coloration — high-end machines were designed to be transparent
- Underestimating restoration and maintenance costs for vintage Studer consoles
- Not researching installation logistics — these are very large, heavy machines
