# MCI Tape Machines

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> MCI (Music Center Incorporated) produced both tape machines and recording consoles that were staples of American studios in the 1970s and 1980s. The MCI JH110 2-track is described as a "pretty good" machine, while MCI consoles are legendary — the custom MCI console from Criteria Studios in Miami (used on the Eagles' "Hotel California") is perhaps the most famous recording console in history. MCI gear is valued for its distinctive EQ character and historical significance.
