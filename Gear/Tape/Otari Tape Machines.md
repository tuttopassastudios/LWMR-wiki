# Otari Tape Machines

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Otari tape machines are reliable Japanese-built workhorses that serve as a practical middle ground between budget Tascam machines and high-end Studer/Ampex units. The Otari 5050 is frequently recommended as a reasonable step up for those getting into tape recording, while the MTR-90 and MX-80 are professional multitrack machines found in many studios. Syncing Otari machines to Pro Tools requires careful setup and a synchronizer.

## Key Characteristics

- **Otari 5050**: 1/4" 2-track or 4-track; recommended as step up from Tascam; "a step up but also reasonable"
- **Otari MX-80**: Professional multitrack; requires sync card for DAW integration
- **Otari MTR-90**: Professional 24-track; used in many professional studios
- **Otari MX7800**: Available on the used market around $2,000
- Reliable and well-built; more accessible than Studer/Ampex price-wise
- Some models have sync card options for DAW integration via Lynx Timeline

## Use Cases

- Step-up machine for those moving beyond Tascam/Fostex
- Professional multitrack recording
- 2-track mixdown to tape
- DAW synchronization for hybrid workflows (with appropriate sync hardware)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- 5050 MKIII is a solid, reliable variant
- Lynx Timeline can sync MX-80 to Pro Tools if the Otari has a sync card and appropriate cable
- Adams Smith Zeta III works well for multi-machine sync setups
- Best practice: have the machine chase Pro Tools rather than the other way around

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Tascam\|Tascam TSR-8]] | More affordable entry point; more colored sound |
| [[Studer Tape Machines\|Studer A800]] | Higher-end professional alternative |
| [[Ampex Tape Machines\|Ampex MM1200]] | American professional multitrack |
| [[MCI Tape Machines\|MCI JH110]] | American alternative at similar price points |

## Common Mistakes

- Attempting to slave Pro Tools to an Otari without proper synchronizer hardware — "more of a headache and too inconsistent"
- Not budgeting for sync hardware (Lynx Timeline, Adams Smith Zeta III) when planning hybrid tape/digital setups
- Buying untested machines without factoring in potential repair costs
