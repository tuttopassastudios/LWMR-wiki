# SPL Monitor Controller

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> SPL (Sound Performance Lab) makes a range of monitor controllers from budget-friendly units to high-end surround controllers. They appear frequently in the community, particularly in discussions about monitoring paths, SPL metering, and studio infrastructure. The SPL Crimson is a combined interface/monitor controller. Their units are German-made and generally well-regarded, though discussions often focus more on the category of monitor controllers in general than on SPL-specific features.

## Key Characteristics

- German-made monitor controllers at various price points
- The Crimson combines interface and monitoring functions
- Surround controller models available for immersive audio
- Stepped or continuous attenuation depending on model
- Multiple speaker output switching on higher-end models

## Use Cases

- Studio monitoring control and speaker switching
- Level calibration for consistent monitoring
- Talkback and headphone distribution (on larger models)
- Immersive audio monitoring (surround models)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Parking the monitor volume at a calibrated position is "the biggest game changer" — knowing what a given knob position means for your room level improves mixing decisions
- Calibrate to -20 = 78 dB SPL in a small room for reference

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Audient Nero]] | Budget favorite; excellent L/R matching |
| [[Grace Design m905]] | High-end reference standard |
| Drawmer CMC2 | Budget option; reliability concerns reported |
| Crane Song Avocet | High-end alternative; colored sound per some |

## Common Mistakes

- Using a cheap monitor controller that introduces L/R imbalance at low volumes
- Not calibrating the monitoring level to a known reference
- Overlooking the monitor controller as part of the signal chain quality
