# Grace Design m905

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Grace Design m905 is a high-end reference monitor controller with optional built-in DAC and digital inputs. It is one of the most highly recommended monitor controllers in the community, sitting at the top of the price and quality spectrum alongside the Crane Song Avocet. It supports digital AES output for direct connection to active digital monitors like PMC 6-2s, and offers extensive configuration options.

## Key Characteristics

- Reference-grade analog monitor controller
- Optional digital input cards (AES, S/PDIF, TOSLINK)
- Digital AES output for direct connection to digital speakers
- Multiple speaker pair switching
- Remote control unit
- Extremely transparent signal path
- Built-in DAC option (optional digital card)

## Use Cases

- Reference-grade studio monitoring
- Digital speaker workflows (AES out to PMC 6-2, Genelec SAM, etc.)
- Mastering studios requiring the highest transparency
- Studios with multiple monitor pairs needing reliable switching

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Configure digital output as speaker output in the menu for AES monitor connections
- Apollo > S/PDIF or TOSLINK > Grace m905 > AES out > digital speakers is a valid signal path

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Crane Song Avocet | Similar tier; some find it slightly colored |
| [[SPL Monitor Controller]] | Budget to mid-range alternatives |
| [[Audient Nero]] | Significantly cheaper; excellent for the price |
| Merging Anubis | Network audio approach with monitoring |

## Common Mistakes

- Not configuring the digital output mode correctly in the menu for speaker routing
- Over-spending on a monitor controller before investing in room treatment and quality monitors

> "I can highly recommend a Grace Design M905, but like the Avocet, it is not cheap. You can always add a UA Arrow to act as a monitor controller... until you're ready to step up to a Grace, Cranesong or even something like a Merging Anubis." — Rollmottle
