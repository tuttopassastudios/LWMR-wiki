# Audient Nero

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Audient Nero is a desktop monitor controller that has become a community favorite in the budget-to-mid-range category. It features Audient's Precision Matched Attenuation Technology, which ensures the left and right channels attenuate identically at all volume positions — solving a common problem with cheaper controllers. Multiple members use and recommend it. The only notable complaint is the lack of a dedicated talkback output.

## Key Characteristics

- Desktop form factor with large volume knob
- Precision Matched Attenuation — L/R channels track perfectly across the volume range
- Accepts digital input (optical/coaxial) as well as analog
- Multiple speaker output pairs for A/B switching
- Headphone output (can be repurposed for talkback)
- 1/4" jacks for all connections (no XLR)
- Transparent signal path — "very transparent to my ear"

## Use Cases

- Primary monitor controller for home and project studios
- Speaker switching between multiple monitor pairs
- Budget alternative to Grace Design or Crane Song units
- Pairing with external DAC for improved monitoring path

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[SPL Monitor Controller]] | Various models at various price points |
| [[Grace Design m905]] | Significantly more expensive; reference standard |
| Drawmer CMC2 | Similar price; reliability concerns reported |
| RME ADI-2 | Volume control via DAC (different approach) |

## Common Mistakes

- Worrying about the "Precision Matched Attenuation" marketing — it simply means the pot taper is corrected so L/R stay balanced at all volumes
- Using 1/4" connections when your setup is all XLR — adapters or custom cables needed
