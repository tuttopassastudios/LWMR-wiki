# Mojave MA-200

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Mojave MA-200 is a tube large diaphragm condenser from [[Mojave Microphones]], designed by David Royer. It is one of the more frequently recommended sub-$1K LDCs, though community opinion is divided. One engineer bought it years ago and finds it "rather bright" in a way that is "not easy to remove in the mix," while others list it among recommended alternatives to the [[Neumann U87]]. The brightness is its defining characteristic -- it either works for you or it does not.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm tube condenser
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** David Royer design, nano-size tube (difficult to replace), sub-$1K tube LDC option

## Use Cases

The MA-200 is positioned as a sub-$1K vocal microphone alternative to more expensive options. It appears on recommended lists alongside the [[Microtech Gefell|Gefell M930]], Shure KSM44, [[Audio-Technica AT4050]], and Austrian Audio OC18. One engineer has it in their mic locker alongside a U87, Aston Spirit, and AT4050 but reports not doing much tracking anymore. It is described as a mic that is "an excellent version of itself rather than a cut-rate version of a 47."

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Telefunken Microphones\|Telefunken TF-51]] | "A million times better" according to one MA-200 owner; used price may be in budget |
| [[Microtech Gefell\|Gefell M930]] | Competing sub-$1K recommendation; different tonal character |
| Shure KSM44 | Both in the sub-$1K workhorse category |
| [[Audio-Technica AT4050]] | Multi-pattern alternative at similar price |
| Austrian Audio OC18 | Modern competitor in the same range |

## Common Mistakes

- Not accounting for the persistent brightness that is difficult to EQ out of the mix
- Tube replacement is inconvenient due to the nano-size tubes used
