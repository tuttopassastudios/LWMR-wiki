# Warm Audio WA-251

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Warm Audio WA-251 is a budget tube condenser designed as a clone of the legendary [[AKG-Telefunken 251]]. Community consensus is clear: the head amp circuit is "close" but the capsule is "emphatically not." When compared against a real 251 at Westlake, one engineer "didn't find that it sounded particularly close." However, with aftermarket modifications -- particularly the Heiserman HK12 capsule and Signal Art circuit upgrades -- the WA-251 can be brought significantly closer to authentic 251 territory, making it a viable platform for modification rather than a finished product.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm tube condenser
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern (cardioid, omni, figure-8)
- **Notable Features:** Budget 251 clone platform, responds well to modification, tube-based circuit

## Use Cases

The WA-251 is used for vocal tracking in project and home studios. Some engineers love it stock -- "love the warm 251!" -- while others treat it as a modification platform. One engineer pairs it with a KM184 for instruments. It also sees use as a handheld tracking mic. The Signal Art modification (from a former Warm Audio circuit designer) replaces "most of the circuit of the WA-251 to be as close to a 251 as possible."

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The Heiserman HK12 capsule swap is the most impactful single modification
- Signal Art circuit modification addresses the electronics side
- Combined mods bring it "closer in the ballpark than most of the sub 3K 251 clones"
- One user reports noise/interference issues with tube operation -- check electrical grounding

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[AKG-Telefunken 251]] | The original; WA-251 is not close without modification |
| [[Telefunken Microphones\|Telefunken 251E]] | Significantly more expensive but genuinely close to original |
| [[Bock Microphones\|Bock 251]] | Higher-tier clone; more highly regarded stock |
| Heiserman 251 | Built with the same capsule/circuit upgrades as a fully modded WA-251 |
| [[Peluso Microphones\|Peluso 251]] | Another budget 251 clone with mixed reception |
