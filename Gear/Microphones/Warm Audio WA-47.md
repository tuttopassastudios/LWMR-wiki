# Warm Audio WA-47

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Warm Audio WA-47 is a budget tube condenser inspired by the [[Neumann U47]]. The community is characteristically blunt: "WA47 sounds nothing like U47" but some members still find value in it on its own terms -- "although WA47 sounds nothing like U47, I like them." It is the most affordable entry point into the U47-inspired sound, though engineers consistently recommend saving for higher-quality alternatives like the Flea 47 or [[Soyuz 017]] if vintage U47 character is the actual goal. Noise issues have been reported by multiple users.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm tube condenser
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern
- **Notable Features:** Budget U47-inspired design, tube circuit, accessible price point

## Use Cases

The WA-47 serves as an affordable LDC for project studios and as a secondary microphone in professional setups. It has been used on kick drums (as a "warm audio FET 47" variant) and vocal tracking. One engineer used it successfully at a friend's studio but found noise problems at home due to poor electrical wiring. In a direct comparison with a new Neumann FET 47 on kick drum, the Neumann had "an octave extra" in the low end.

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting U47 sound -- it is inspired by, not a replica of, the original
- Not checking your electrical environment -- multiple users report noise, crackling, and vinyl-like artifacts that may be related to power quality
- Buying based on name recognition rather than auditioning -- at this price point, a [[Shure SM7B]] may be more useful

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Neumann U47]] | The original; WA-47 sounds "very little like an actual 47" |
| Flea 47 | "The best sounding 47 for my taste" -- significantly more expensive but closer to original |
| [[Soyuz 017]] | NoahNeedleman chose it over 36 mics including WA-47; richer, more complete sound |
| Stam Audio 47 | Another budget 47 clone; some prefer it to Flea in blind tests |
| [[Warm Audio WA-251]] | Same manufacturer's 251 clone; different vintage inspiration |
