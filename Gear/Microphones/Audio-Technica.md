# Audio-Technica

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Audio-Technica is a Japanese manufacturer producing a broad range of microphones and headphones, from budget condensers to professional-grade studio mics. The community generally respects their mid-to-upper tier offerings while viewing their budget mics as entry-level tools. The [[Audio-Technica AT4050|AT4050]] is the most praised microphone in their lineup, with the AT4060 (tube), AT4041 (SDC), and AT4081 (active ribbon) also receiving positive mentions. The ATH-M50x headphones are considered the best value tracking headphones available. Audio-Technica occupies a practical "not to be slept on" space in the gear landscape.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Condensers (LDC and SDC), dynamics, active ribbons, headphones
- **Notable Models:** [[Audio-Technica AT4050|AT4050]], [[Audio-Technica AT2020|AT2020]], AT4060, AT4041, AT4081, ATH-M50x, ATH-R70x
- **Notable Features:** Wide product range, strong value proposition in the $500-$1,000 range, reliable build quality

## Use Cases

The AT4050 is used on vocals, drum rooms, and general studio duties -- one engineer recalls using it on a jazz vocal where "there was some high ticket items on the floor, M49s, 47s, 48s... and we stuck the AT on vocal and it killed." The AT4041 is a respected SDC for acoustic instruments and overheads, recommended as a "$500 option" when budget is a concern. The AT4060 tube mic is "pretty good, quite dark." The AT4081 active ribbon appears in recommended mic lists alongside Royer and Coles. The M50x headphones are the standard tracking recommendation: "still the best bang for your buck" at $150.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| Austrian Audio OC18 | Modern competitor at similar price; "if you're buying C414s, just get Austrian Audio OC18s instead" |
| [[AKG C414]] | AT4050 competes directly; 414 has more brand cachet but AT offers strong value |
| [[Neumann U87]] | AT4050 holds its own in blind shootouts despite massive price difference |
| [[Rode Microphones]] | AT generally regarded as higher quality at comparable prices |
| Beyerdynamic DT770 | M50x competitor for tracking headphones |
