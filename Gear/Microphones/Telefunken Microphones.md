# Telefunken Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Telefunken Elektroakustik is a modern microphone manufacturer that licensed the Telefunken name and builds recreations of classic designs, most notably the 251 and various tube microphones. The community holds nuanced views -- the brand "shares no lineage or engineering with the original company" as one member noted, yet many engineers find their products excellent in their own right. The Telefunken 251E is widely considered the best modern 251 recreation, while the Alchemy series (TF29, TF51) offers more affordable entry points. Discussions also frequently reference vintage Telefunken vacuum tubes, which are highly prized for tube-swapping in other microphones.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condensers (tube and FET variants)
- **Notable Models:** 251E, TF29, TF51 (Alchemy series), CU29, Copperhead, M80 (dynamic)
- **Notable Features:** 251E uses reskinned vintage-style capsules; Alchemy series offers "affordable" versions of classic designs; Copperhead provides entry-level tube character

## Use Cases

The 251E is the community's reference for modern 251-style microphones, used primarily on vocals where brightness and air are desired. The TF51 is praised for punching "above its weight class" as an affordable alternative. The Copperhead is valued as a versatile, affordable tube mic with "a little tube-y, warm side" character that opens up well with EQ. The M80 dynamic is called "incredible" for live vocals, though at three times the price of an SM58. Vintage Telefunken tubes (ECC803S) are actively sought for swapping into other manufacturers' tube mics, particularly [[Lewitt Microphones|Lewitt]] models.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The TF51 is considered the sweet spot of the lineup for value -- it punches above its price class but "isn't gonna get you to a $10k mic sound"
- The Copperhead can be found used for around $600 and responds well to EQ on the top end
- When tube swapping, beware of counterfeit vintage Telefunken tubes -- modern Telefunkens are rebranded JJs that look nearly identical to vintage originals
- Tesla E83CC tubes are the same design as the original Telefunken ECC803S and are a more affordable, genuine alternative

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Bock Microphones\|Bock 251]] | Another respected 251 clone; some engineers upgrade from Bock to Telefunken 251E for more top-end air |
| [[Soyuz 017]] | Direct competitor to TF29; community found Soyuz richer and less brittle |
| [[AKG-Telefunken 251]] | The original vintage mic; wildly expensive and inconsistent unit-to-unit |
| Peluso 251 | Budget 251 alternative with mixed community reception |
| [[Warm Audio WA-251]] | Budget option; circuit is "close" but capsule is "emphatically not" |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming modern Telefunken has direct lineage to the original German electronics company -- they licensed the name and started from scratch
- Buying expensive "Telefunken" vacuum tubes without authentication -- the market is flooded with fakes
- Comparing the Alchemy series directly to vintage originals -- they are inspired by, not replicas of, the classics
