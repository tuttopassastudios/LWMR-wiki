# Neumann KM184

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neumann KM184 is a modern small diaphragm condenser and the successor to the vintage [[Neumann KM84]]. While it does not carry the same mystique as its predecessor, the community finds it a reliable, well-regarded SDC for studio work. Designed with a high-frequency boost for diffuse-field applications, it sounds "more forward" than the KM84 but "not necessarily brighter in the super highs." Cian riordan used KM184s to create impulse responses at Barefoot Recording Studio, and multiple engineers keep matched pairs as their go-to SDCs.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Small diaphragm condenser (FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid (fixed)
- **Notable Features:** Presence peak in the high frequencies, designed for diffuse-field response, available as matched pair

## Use Cases

The KM184 is used on acoustic guitar, piano, drum overheads, strings, and general instrument miking. It is a standard recommendation for matched-pair SDC duties. Cian riordan's impulse responses made with KM184s at Barefoot "sound great." One engineer pairs a WA-251 for vocals with a KM184 for instruments. They are recommended as a starting point for stereo recording alongside AEA R88A and Austrian Audio OC18s.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Neumann KM84]] | Predecessor; flatter high end, more "special" feeling; "the delta between KM84 and KM184 is not the same as U87 vs U87ai" |
| [[Soyuz Microphones\|Soyuz 013 FET]] | Modern alternative; chosen over KM184 for sounding "more life-like" |
| Josephson C42 | Higher-end SDC; different character |
| Beyerdynamic M930 | "KM84 midrange presence but without the sparkle of a 451" |
| [[Microtech Gefell]] MC930 | Not to be confused with Gefell M930 (LDC); different mic entirely |
