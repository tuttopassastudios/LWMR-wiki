# Warm Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Warm Audio is a budget-oriented manufacturer known for producing affordable clones of classic microphone designs, including the WA-47, [[Warm Audio WA-251|WA-251]], WA-67, and WA-87. Community opinion is divided -- some find genuine value in the lineup, with one member reporting a WA-67 "sounds triple its price point," while others caution that these are not substitutes for the originals. The prevailing wisdom is that Warm Audio gear is "cool if you're really strapped for cash" but should not be expected to replicate the real thing. The brand is described as "the most common clone in the producer/beat maker world."

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condensers (tube and FET variants)
- **Notable Models:** [[Warm Audio WA-47|WA-47]], [[Warm Audio WA-251|WA-251]], WA-67, WA-87, FET 47
- **Notable Features:** Budget clones of classic designs, tube-based circuits on flagship models, accessible price points for home studios

## Use Cases

Warm Audio microphones serve as entry points for engineers who want vintage-inspired sounds at accessible prices. The WA-251 is used for vocal tracking, with some engineers further modifying it with Heiserman HK12 capsules and Signal Art circuit upgrades to bring it closer to authentic 251 territory. The WA FET 47 sees use on kick drums paired with a D112 for attack. The WA-67 is praised as surprisingly capable on certain sources. Multiple engineers use Warm Audio mics as secondary or backup microphones in studios that also own higher-end gear.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The WA-251 benefits significantly from aftermarket modifications -- the Heiserman HK12 capsule and Signal Art circuit mod are specifically recommended
- The WA FET 47 on kick drum works well but can sound "a little small" compared to premium alternatives
- A direct comparison of the WA FET 47 vs new Neumann FET 47 on kick showed the Neumann had "an octave extra" in the low end
- Tube swapping on the WA-67 and WA-47 can yield noticeable improvements

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Neumann U47]] | The original; "WA47 sounds nothing like U47" but is liked on its own merits |
| [[AKG-Telefunken 251]] | WA-251 circuit is "close" but capsule is "emphatically not" |
| Golden Age Project | Similar price tier; community finds GA products surprisingly good |
| [[Mojave Microphones\|Mojave]] | Slightly higher tier; community has mixed feelings on both |
| [[Rode Microphones]] | Comparable price bracket for some models; different design philosophy |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting a WA-251 to sound like a real 251 -- "Don't buy the also expensive knockoff when you want the real thing"
- Buying Warm Audio outboard processing alongside their mics thinking it will achieve "the thing" -- community advises investing in fewer, higher-quality pieces
- Not investing in modifications -- stock Warm Audio mics improve substantially with capsule and circuit upgrades
- Overlooking noise issues -- multiple users report electrical noise problems, particularly with the WA-47
