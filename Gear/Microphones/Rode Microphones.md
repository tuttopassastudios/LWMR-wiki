# Rode Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Rode is an Australian microphone manufacturer offering a wide range of products from budget condensers to professional-grade recording mics. The community view is nuanced -- "early Rode mics sound amazing" but modern budget offerings are viewed with less enthusiasm. The [[Rode NT1]] is their most discussed model, alongside the NTK (tube), Classic II, NT-SF1 (surround), and various video/mobile accessories. Rode occupies a unique space as a brand with both budget and legitimate professional products, though the community generally steers engineers toward other options at comparable price points.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Condensers (FET and tube), dynamics, specialty mics
- **Notable Models:** [[Rode NT1]], NTK, Classic II, NT-SF1, VideoMic series, AI Micro
- **Notable Features:** Broad product range from budget to professional, strong mobile/video mic ecosystem

## Use Cases

Rode mics serve a wide range of applications. The NTK tube mic is valued for its warm character. The NT-SF1 surround mic (based on a licensed SoundField design) is used for ambisonic recording of orchestras and nature ambience. The VideoMic series and AI Micro interface are popular for mobile content creation. For studio vocal tracking, community members generally recommend alternatives unless budget is the primary constraint -- "if you have a Scarlett 2i2 and a Rode microphone, there's other things to upgrade before you look for a used stereo tube unit."

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Shure SM7B]] | Preferred for vocals by many; different technology (dynamic vs condenser) |
| [[Audio-Technica AT2020]] | Competing budget condenser; similar price tier |
| [[Warm Audio]] | Both serve budget-conscious market; different design philosophies |
| Sennheiser Ambeo | Competes with NT-SF1 for spatial audio; Rode's SoundField platform preferred |
| [[Rode NT1]] | Their best-known model; see dedicated page |
