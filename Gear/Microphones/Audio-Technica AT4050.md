# Audio-Technica AT4050

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Audio-Technica AT4050 is a multi-pattern large diaphragm condenser that the community considers one of the most underrated workhorses in its price range. "Another underrated workhorse mic? AT4050" and "4050s are the bae. Really nice mics, never sucked in my experience!" capture the consistent positive sentiment. One engineer recalls a jazz session with M49s, U47s, and U48s on the floor, but "we stuck the AT on vocal and it killed." The AT4050 is praised for neutrality, versatility, and reliability -- it does everything well without dramatic coloration.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser (FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern (cardioid, omni, figure-8)
- **Notable Features:** Dual diaphragm design, multi-pattern capability, surprisingly neutral response, strong value proposition

## Use Cases

The AT4050 excels in virtually any studio application:
- **Vocals:** "Surprisingly neutral" and "killed" on jazz vocals alongside vintage mics
- **Drum rooms:** "Super cool on drum rooms" according to one engineer
- **General studio:** The multi-pattern capability adds versatility that fixed-pattern mics lack
- It appears on multiple "sub-$1K recommended mics" lists alongside the Gefell M930, Shure KSM44, and Austrian Audio OC18

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[AKG C414]] | Both are multi-pattern workhorses; AT4050 offers better value |
| [[Microtech Gefell\|Gefell M930]] | Both in the sub-$1K tier; Gefell is more community-buzzworthy |
| Austrian Audio OC18 | Modern competitor; both offer strong value |
| Shure KSM44 | Both sub-$1K multi-purpose LDCs |
| [[Mojave MA-200]] | AT4050 is more neutral; MA-200 is brighter with tube character |
