# Soyuz 017

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Soyuz 017 is a large diaphragm condenser available in both Tube and FET variants, widely regarded as one of the best modern vocal microphones available. NoahNeedleman chose it after a 36-mic shootout at Vintage King, and the community consistently praises it for delivering "a very complete sound" that is "really rich all the way through the spectrum." The 017 uses a Russian K67 capsule and is positioned as a modern alternative to vintage U47/U67-style microphones without attempting to be a direct clone. Engineers describe it as an "amazing all-around workhorse mic" for vocals and acoustic guitars.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser (available in Tube and FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** Russian K67 capsule, tube or FET circuit options, rich full-spectrum response without mid-focus opacity or brittle top end

## Use Cases

The 017 is primarily a vocal microphone that excels across genres. One engineer reports: "Highly recommend the Soyuz 017 Tube. I record 95% female vocals, mostly pop, a small amount of country -- and it absolutely crushes for me." Another went through multiple LDCs (ADK, Stam 87-T, SE Gemini, Townsend Sphere) before "selling them all" and keeping only the 017 FET because it "sounds fantastic on everything." Beyond vocals, it is praised on acoustic guitars and pairs well enough with an [[AEA R84]] that one engineer used both for stereo vocal tracking. The 017 Tube is also noted for pairing well with a 1073 preamp.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- **Tube vs FET:** The Tube version offers richer harmonics and body; the FET is brighter and more forward. Choose based on whether you "always want a bright vocal" (FET) or prefer warmth (Tube)
- Compared head-to-head with [[Telefunken Microphones|Telefunken TF29]], the 017 was found to be "richer all the way through the spectrum" without brittle top end
- Pairs well with BAE 1073, Great River, and similar warm preamps
- One engineer uses it as the sole flagship LDC in their studio and has not felt the need for alternatives

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Telefunken Microphones\|Telefunken TF29]] | Similar concept, different price; community prefers Soyuz for richness |
| [[Lauten Audio Eden]] | Both excel as vocal workhorse mics; Eden offers multi-voicing flexibility |
| Flea 47 | Better for vintage U47 replication specifically; Soyuz is its own thing |
| [[Neumann U67]] (reissue) | Some engineers not blown away by U67ri; Soyuz offers comparable vibe at lower cost |
| [[Bock Microphones\|UA Bock 251]] | Different character; one engineer chose Bock over Soyuz in their shootout |
| Vanguard V13 | Budget tube alternative; different sonic character |
