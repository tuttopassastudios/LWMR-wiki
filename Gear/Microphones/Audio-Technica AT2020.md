# Audio-Technica AT2020

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Audio-Technica AT2020 is a budget large diaphragm condenser that serves as many engineers' first "real" microphone. At around $100, it has been used on professional releases -- notably by one artist who made it work effectively. The community generally views it as a stepping stone, with most engineers recommending alternatives even at the same price point. One member describes it as having "that sharp feel to it" in the upper frequencies, and the consensus leans toward an SM58 or [[Shure SM7B]] as better investments for vocal work.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser (FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** Ultra-budget price point, USB variant available, widely available

## Use Cases

The AT2020 is used primarily in home studio and bedroom production environments. It is adequate for scratch vocals, demos, and content creation. One engineer questions "what brought you to the 2020?" when it comes up in conversation, noting that "the 2020, NT1, and SM7B are wildly different mics" serving different purposes. Multiple community members have moved on from the AT2020 to other options.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Rode NT1]] | More refined condenser at slightly higher price |
| [[Shure SM58]] | Dynamic alternative; often preferred for untreated rooms |
| [[Shure SM7B]] | Significant upgrade for vocal tracking |
| Rode NT1A | Similar price tier condenser |
| Audio-Technica AT4050 | Massive step up within the same brand |
