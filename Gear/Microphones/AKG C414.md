# AKG C414

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The AKG C414 is a multi-pattern large diaphragm condenser with a long production history spanning multiple revisions, each with a distinct sonic character. Vintage variants (EB, B-ULS) with the original brass-ring CK12 capsule are the most prized, while modern XL II/XLS versions receive less enthusiasm from the community. "The best new AKG 414 is the Austrian Audio OC818" quips one member, reflecting the general sentiment that Austrian Audio (founded by former AKG engineers) has surpassed AKG's current offerings. Still, the C414 remains a versatile workhorse mic found in studios worldwide.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser (FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern (9 selectable patterns on modern versions)
- **Notable Features:** Multiple pattern selections, pad and filter switches, decades of production with varying capsule generations
- **Variants:** EB (vintage, brass CK12), B-ULS (transitional), XL II (modern, brighter), XLS (modern, flatter)

## Use Cases

The C414 is used across nearly all studio applications -- vocals (especially in metal and rock), drum overheads, acoustic instruments, and room miking. Vintage C414 B-ULS models appear in highly regarded mic collections alongside U87s and Schoeps. The XL II is specifically popular with metal vocalists. Engineers also use C414s on kick drum outside and piano. Finding repair for vintage units can be challenging -- one engineer in Michigan could not find anyone to work on their vintage C414.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| Austrian Audio OC818 | "The best new AKG 414 is the Austrian Audio OC818" -- made by former AKG engineers |
| Austrian Audio OC18 | Budget alternative; "if you're buying C414s, just get Austrian Audio OC18s instead" |
| [[Audio-Technica AT4050]] | Both multi-pattern workhorses; AT4050 offers strong value |
| [[Neumann U87]] | More expensive; different tonal character |
| Heritage Audio | Mentioned as preferred alternative: "I'd go OC16 and a Heritage all day" |
