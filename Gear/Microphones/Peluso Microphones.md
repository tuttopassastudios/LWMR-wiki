# Peluso Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Peluso is a microphone manufacturer specializing in clones of classic vintage designs including the U47, U67, U87, AKG C12, and 251. Community opinion is mixed -- one local tech "reps Peluso hard" noting build quality "on par if not better than the originals," while another engineer warns to "steer you away from Peluso" after frustrating experiences mixing vocals recorded on their P67 due to problematic high mids and 9-12kHz region. The P12 (C12 clone) receives the most positive attention, with multiple engineers vouching for its vocal performance. Peluso offers direct demos, which the community recommends taking advantage of.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condensers (tube)
- **Notable Models:** P12 (C12 clone), P67 (U67 clone), P87 (U87 clone), P251 (251 clone), P414 (C414 clone)
- **Notable Features:** Vintage-style tube circuits, wide range of classic mic recreations, direct demo program available

## Use Cases

The P12 is the standout model, used regularly on vocalists -- "I've got a Peluso P12, which is a clone of the AKG C12 and it does the job quite well." The P414 copy is described as "a beautiful mic modelled on the brass cap and super small." The P67 receives the most criticism, with engineers finding the high-mid and upper-frequency region problematic for vocal mixing. Engineers generally use Peluso mics as more affordable alternatives to vintage originals in home and project studios.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Warm Audio]] | Similar price-tier clone market; Peluso generally has better build quality but worse capsules than Warm's 3U capsules |
| [[Bock Microphones]] | Higher-end clone market; generally preferred but significantly more expensive |
| [[Telefunken Microphones]] | More expensive recreations with more community confidence |
| Golden Age Project | Similar budget clone market |
| [[Microtech Gefell\|Gefell M930]] | Different approach; original design rather than clone, often preferred |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming graph-based comparisons translate to real-world performance -- "a 201 is not like a 251 AT ALL in actual use" applies to Peluso clones as well
- Not requesting a demo directly from Peluso before purchasing
- Expecting the P67 to mix like a real U67 -- the high-mid character is a known issue
