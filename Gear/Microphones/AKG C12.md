# AKG C12

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The AKG C12 is a multi-pattern tube condenser microphone that shares DNA with the legendary 251 and sits at the pinnacle of vintage microphone design. Built in Vienna from 1953 through the early 1960s, the C12 features the iconic CK12 brass capsule that went on to define the sonic character of an entire family of microphones, including the 414 and 251. Community members place it firmly in the "251/C12 zone" -- a bright, detailed, hi-fi tube sound that excels on vocals and acoustic instruments. With original units commanding up to $30,000 or more, the C12's influence lives on through numerous clones, descendants, and the Austrian Audio OC818 which was designed by former AKG engineers.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm tube condenser
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern (9 settings via remote control box)
- **Notable Features:** Original CK12 brass capsule, 6072 tube, remote-controlled pattern selection, extremely high output, related to the 251 and 414 lineages

## Use Cases

The C12 excels in the same territory as the 251 but with a slightly more hi-fi, detailed presentation. NoahNeedleman distinguishes related mics by noting the Brauner VM1, for instance, "doesn't do the C12 thing. It's like a more precise and more even sounding U87." The C12 is a top-tier vocal microphone and works beautifully on acoustic instruments, strings, and as a drum overhead. Eliot Infuze describes gravitating toward "the 251/C12 zone as a general sound" for vocal recording. Eric Martin recounts a shootout of a "U67/U47/C12/Lucas CS-1 at a local studio" where the mics were evaluated on a female vocalist, illustrating how engineers regularly pit the C12 against other legendary mics. Peterlabberton recalls a producer running a Brauner (in the C12 sonic family) "straight into an 1176 with no mic pre, and just blow it up" over a kick drum -- the high output of C12-style mics makes this possible.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The remote pattern selection is a key feature; cardioid for close vocal work, but the ability to dial between patterns without touching the mic is invaluable during tracking
- The CK12 brass capsule is what gives the mic its magic; modern ceramic recreations (like Austrian Audio's) attempt to capture this character with more consistency
- Pairs well with clean, transparent preamps that let the tube character speak, or with transformer-based preamps for added warmth
- Vintage units benefit from professional maintenance; Korby and other specialists offer capsule modifications and reskinning
- Zack Hames notes the Austrian Audio OC818 sits "somewhere between the transformer 414s and a C12A" and was "designed by people who were originally at AKG"

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[AKG-Telefunken 251]] | Sibling mic from the same era; shares the CK12 capsule but with a different circuit, slightly warmer and less "hi-fi" |
| Austrian Audio OC818 | Modern FET descendant designed by ex-AKG engineers; mimics the brass CK12 capsule in ceramic. Zack Hames: "amazing on vocals, guitar amp, kick drum, acoustic guitar, toms" |
| Peluso P12 | C12 clone; Slow Hand: "does the job quite well... I use it regularly on vocalists" |
| Lucas CS-1 | Rare boutique C12-based mic; Eric Martin calls it his go-to and it beat U67/U47/C12 in a shootout on female vocals |
| AKG C414 EB (brass capsule) | Peterlabberton: "the only 414 I fuck with." The only 414 variant David Fuller considers "worth a shit on anything other than tom close mics" |
| Brauner VM1 | In the same hi-fi zone but NoahNeedleman says it is "like a more precise and more even sounding U87" rather than a true C12 alternative |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming all C12-related mics sound the same. The C12, 251, 414 EB, and their descendants each have distinct voicing despite sharing capsule lineage.
- Buying a vintage C12 without expert inspection. Capsule condition is everything -- reskinning is possible but expensive, and some capsules are beyond repair. Eliot Infuze had a "Korby-modified frankenstein C12 mic" that "crapped out" with an unsalvageable capsule.
- Overlooking the Austrian Audio alternatives. At $850 for the OC18 (cardioid only), these modern descendants of AKG engineering offer remarkable value compared to vintage pricing.
- Conflating the C12 VR (1990s reissue) with the original. The VR is a different microphone and does not command the same regard in the community.
