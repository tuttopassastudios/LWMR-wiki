# Lauten Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Lauten Audio is an American microphone manufacturer known for their multi-voicing microphones that offer switchable tonal characters within a single body. The [[Lauten Audio Eden|Eden (LT-386)]] is their flagship, while the Atlantis, Clarion, Oceanus, and budget LA-220/LA-320 fill out the lineup. The community appreciates Lauten's innovative FNG (Forward/Neutral/Gentle) voicing switches that essentially provide "three different mics" in one body. NoahNeedleman and hyanrarvey are notable advocates, with the brand generating active discussion around its value proposition in the competitive $1,000-$3,500 vocal mic market.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condensers (FET)
- **Notable Models:** [[Lauten Audio Eden|Eden (LT-386)]], Atlantis, Clarion, Oceanus, LA-320, LA-220
- **Notable Features:** FNG voicing switches (Forward/Neutral/Gentle), multi-pattern capability on higher models, figure-8 mode praised for acoustic instruments

## Use Cases

Lauten mics are primarily used for vocal tracking, with the Eden recommended as a workhorse for both male and female vocals plus acoustic guitars. The Atlantis in figure-8 mode "does some really cool things on acoustic" guitar, with the FNG switch dramatically changing the mic's character in that pattern. The Oceanus sees use as a general studio condenser. One engineer noted the Atlantis could replace a U87 for many applications: "U87s are sorta Swiss Army knife mics and I don't think they're necessarily worth the price when the Eden, or the cheaper Atlantis are available." The budget LA-320 is criticized for harsh top end and sibilance issues.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The Forward voicing on the Eden adds presence and air; Gentle rolls off the top for warmer sources
- Figure-8 mode on the Atlantis is specifically worth exploring for acoustic instruments
- The Eden paired with a BAE 1073 preamp is a popular combination, though watch for sibilance with some voices
- A good preamp makes "a huge difference" with the Eden, particularly in taming upper-mid harshness

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Soyuz 017]] | Both recommended as premium vocal mics; Soyuz is more single-voiced, Lauten more flexible |
| [[Neumann U87]] | Eden competes directly; multi-voicing adds versatility the U87 lacks |
| [[Lewitt Microphones\|Lewitt LCT-840/940]] | Both offer modern versatility; Lewitt through tube/FET blending, Lauten through voicing switches |
| Manley Reference Cardioid | Higher price tier; one engineer sold their Ref C after getting the Atlantis |
| [[Microtech Gefell\|Gefell M930]] | Different approach to the same price bracket; Gefell is more neutral |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting the LA-320 to represent the quality of the higher models -- it has known sibilance and harsh top-end issues
- Not experimenting with all voicing positions and polar patterns -- the switches dramatically change the mic's character
- Dismissing the voicing switches as gimmicky -- they are a genuinely useful feature in practice
