# Electro-Voice RE20

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Electro-Voice RE20 is a large diaphragm dynamic microphone that the community considers "super slept on." Known for its Variable-D design that eliminates proximity effect, the RE20 delivers a sound that sits between a dynamic and a condenser -- "sounds like a little more of a condenser than an SM7" as one member described it. Engineers praise it for vocals, kick drum, broadcast, and general utility work. It performs exceptionally well in untreated and reflective rooms, making it a versatile alternative to the more popular [[Shure SM7B]].

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm dynamic
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** Variable-D design (no proximity effect), internal windscreen, very low handling noise, broadcast-standard mic

## Use Cases

The RE20 is used across a surprisingly wide range of applications:
- **Kick drum:** "I've fallen in love with RE20 on kick. It just sounds like a great version of whatever drum it is."
- **Vocals:** "re20 on vocals > sm7 all dayyy" -- several engineers actively prefer it over the SM7B
- **Untreated rooms:** Works well even in reflective spaces due to tight cardioid pattern
- **Broadcast:** A standard for voiceover and podcasting
- The related EV 668 is described as "a darker/beefier RE20" with internal EQ options

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Benefits from a [[Cloudlifter]] or high-gain preamp for optimal signal-to-noise ratio
- No proximity effect means consistent bass response at varying distances -- useful for vocalists who move
- Plosives can be more audible than on SM7B despite lack of proximity effect; a pop filter is recommended
- Try it as a "knee mic" over the kick, pointing at snare for additional applications

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Shure SM7B]] | More popular but RE20 preferred by some; RE20 "sounds more like a condenser" |
| [[Shure SM57]] | More affordable; RE20 is a step up in fidelity and low-end response |
| AKG D112 | Both excel on kick drum; RE20 is more versatile across other sources |
| EV 668 | Darker, beefier variant with internal EQ; harder to find |
| Sennheiser MD421 | Another versatile dynamic; different tonal character |

## Common Mistakes

- Overlooking the RE20 in favor of the SM7B simply due to popularity -- it may actually be the better choice for certain voices
- Not accounting for plosive sensitivity -- despite no proximity effect, plosives are still audible
- Attempting to use it at distance -- it is primarily a close-mic application tool
