# Sony C-800G

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Sony C-800G is a large diaphragm tube condenser that has become iconic in pop and hip-hop vocal production. Known for its bright, detailed, and "thick yet controlled" low end, the C-800G commands premium prices and is difficult to source and service. The community acknowledges its legendary status -- "Literally me after using a C800G for the first time this weekend and realizing it actually is the best I've ever heard" -- while also noting that the [[Lewitt LCT 940]] offers "legitimately identical" sound in FET mode at a fraction of the cost. Maintenance is a significant concern, as properly serviced units are essential to achieving the mic's renowned sound.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm tube condenser
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern (cardioid, omni, figure-8)
- **Notable Features:** External power supply with heat pipe cooling system, bright and detailed high end, thick controlled low end, distinctive visual design
- **Important Distinction:** The C800 (non-G) is a different, darker microphone -- "C800 isn't that bright. C800G bright as hell"

## Use Cases

The C-800G is primarily used on lead vocals in pop, hip-hop, and R&B production. It excels where brightness and presence are desired without harshness when properly maintained. One engineer uses it on drum overheads, noting "the low end on the C800 and C800G is super thick yet controlled." Its brightness makes it polarizing -- some find it "plasticky" in the high end -- but when well maintained, "truly amazing mics." The GAP GA800 exists as a budget knockoff but is not considered comparable.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Requires maintenance from Sony-authorized technicians for optimal performance -- "love the C800G when they are well maintained"
- Pairs well with BAE 1073 through a CL1B compressor
- The high end is "very easy to add" with EQ, suggesting the mic's natural brightness may benefit from subtle high-shelf reduction on some voices
- Consider the [[Lewitt LCT 940]] as a budget stand-in that "sounds legitimately identical" in FET mode

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Lewitt LCT 940]] | "Sounds legitimately identical for only $1,700" in FET mode |
| [[Lewitt Microphones\|Lewitt LCT 1040]] | More natural sounding than the 940; closer to the C-800G's overall character |
| GAP GA800 | Budget knockoff; not in the same league |
| Manley Reference Cardioid | Different flavor of tube LDC at similar price tier |
| [[AKG C12]] | Classic bright tube condenser; different vintage character |

## Common Mistakes

- Not ensuring proper maintenance -- poorly maintained units do not deliver the legendary sound
- Confusing the C800 with the C800G -- they are different microphones with very different tonal characters
- Spending $7K+ when a Lewitt 940 may deliver comparable results for a fraction of the price
