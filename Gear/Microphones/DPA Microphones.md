# DPA Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> DPA Microphones is a Danish manufacturer descended from Bruel & Kjaer, known for precision measurement and studio microphones. The community groups DPA with [[Schoeps Microphones]] in the "transparent accuracy" school -- "Schoeps and DPA both fall into this boat." DPA is particularly noted for their miniature instrument mics (4099 series), headworn mics for performance/theater applications, and binaural recording solutions. They are the top choice for clip-on instrument miking and live theatrical applications.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Condensers (miniature, SDC, and measurement grade)
- **Notable Models:** 4021 (cardioid), 4088 (headworn), 4099 (instrument clip-on)
- **Notable Features:** Bruel & Kjaer heritage, excellent miniature/clip-on designs, measurement-grade accuracy, binaural mic kit

## Use Cases

The DPA 4021 is called a "secret weapon on pianos when I have to record them in the same room as other instruments." The 4099 clip-on works well on nylon string guitar and other acoustic instruments where a stand-mounted mic is impractical. The 4088 headworn mic is recommended for dance and dynamic movement performances over necklace-style lavs. DPA is also the top recommendation for binaural recording -- they offer "an interesting binaural mic kit that uses your head." For lav/body mic work, DPA competes directly with Sanken COS11d as the "top choice."

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Schoeps Microphones]] | Both prioritize transparency; Schoeps more common in studio, DPA in field/live |
| Sanken COS11d | Competitor for body/lav mic work; both highly regarded |
| Countryman | Headworn mic competitor; DPA generally preferred for audio quality |
| Sennheiser Ambeo | Binaural/spatial recording competitor |
| [[Earthworks Microphones]] | Both serve accuracy-first applications |
