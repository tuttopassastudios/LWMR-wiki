# Neumann KM84

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neumann KM84 is a vintage small diaphragm condenser (SDC) that holds a special place in the community as a reference for musical, natural-sounding small capsule recording. Discontinued and replaced by the [[Neumann KM184]], the KM84 is prized for its flatter high-end response compared to its successor's presence peak. Engineers describe it as arguably more "flat" and "special" feeling, though the community acknowledges the delta between KM84 and KM184 is not as dramatic as vintage-vs-modern Neumann large diaphragm comparisons. Serviced units sell for around $1,500, making them a significant investment for a vintage SDC.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Small diaphragm condenser (FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** Smoother, flatter high-end response compared to KM184, vintage K84 capsule, available with original Tuchel or XLR connectors

## Use Cases

The KM84 excels on acoustic guitar, upright piano, strings, and close-miked acoustic instruments. One engineer describes wedging a KM84 in foam into the bridge hole of an upright bass with excellent results. It is used extensively on acoustic guitar where one member even re-amped a contact mic through two guitar amps and blended it with the KM84 signal. For SDC-heavy work like acoustic instruments and ensemble recording, the KM84 remains a benchmark. Preamp pairing is an active topic, with engineers seeking recommendations specifically for KM84 pairs on upright piano and acoustic guitars.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The KM84 has midrange presence without the sparkle of a 451 -- it sits in its own tonal space
- Pairs well with 1073-style preamps for acoustic instruments
- Authentication of vintage units requires examination by a known microphone tech -- counterfeit KM84s are not as common as fake 251s or 47s, but due diligence is still recommended
- The Miktek C5 is considered a modern mic that captures the "KM84 vibe"

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Neumann KM184]] | Successor; has a presence peak that makes it more forward-sounding; "84 feels arguably more flat" |
| [[Soyuz Microphones\|Soyuz 013 FET]] | Modern alternative; some prefer it over KM184 for sounding "more life-like" |
| Beyerdynamic M930 | "KM84 midrange presence but without the sparkle of a 451" |
| Miktek C5 | Specifically recommended for "that KM84 vibe" |
| Josephson C42 | High-end SDC alternative; different character |
| AKG 451 | More sparkly top end compared to KM84 |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting a KM184 to sound like a KM84 -- while related, they have different tonal characters
- Not having vintage units inspected -- switches and capsules can degrade over time
- Overpaying without authentication -- have a tech verify before purchasing
