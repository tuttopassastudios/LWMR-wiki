# Neumann U47

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neumann U47 is one of the most legendary microphones in recording history -- the Frank Sinatra mic, the Beatles mic, a cornerstone of the golden age of recording. It is a large diaphragm tube condenser prized for its warm, "gooey" midrange character and natural compression. Community members describe its sound as having a "beautiful classic midrange pocket" that sits in a mix with effortless authority. However, the U47's particular tonal flavor means it is not universally flattering, and vintage units command astronomical prices with significant unit-to-unit variation.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm tube condenser
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid / Omni (switchable)
- **Notable Features:** VF14 tube (original), M7 capsule, warm midrange emphasis, natural harmonic saturation, wide part tolerances in vintage units creating unique sonic signatures per mic

## Use Cases

The U47 is most commonly associated with lead vocals, particularly male vocals where its midrange warmth and natural compression create a "gooey pocketed delicious mid feel" as one community member described it. It also excels on acoustic instruments, upright bass, and brass. However, cian riordan cautions that "even a great sounding 47 won't be a first choice for a vocalist at least 50% of the time. The midrange is very particular and can sound overly warm on most sources." The U47 is best understood as a flavor mic rather than an all-rounder -- incredible when it matches a source, but too specialized to serve as a sole studio microphone.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Cardioid mode is the classic vocal setting; omni opens up for room and ensemble work
- The tube circuit adds natural saturation that increases with louder sources -- the V-251 circuit variant has more saturation on loud sources, while the Fox 460 circuit offers more headroom
- Pairs beautifully with Neve-style preamps and gentle compression (1176, LA-2A) to accentuate the warmth
- Position 6-10 inches from the vocalist; the proximity effect adds low-end weight that is part of the mic's signature sound
- Modern clones benefit from tighter manufacturing tolerances (+/- 1% vs. the original's +/- 10%), which Eric Martin notes means "a new clone could potentially sound better than an old mic"

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| Flea 47 | Community favorite clone; cian riordan calls it "the superior clone." Ross Fortune: "Flea 47 rocks the house" |
| Soyuz 017 Tube | Preferred by some for vocals over the Flea; described as slightly more hi-fi |
| Wunder CM7 | Hit or miss; the M7 capsule version is praised, others less so. ehutton21: "sounds golden on vocals" |
| Warm Audio WA-47 | Budget option; community notes it "sounds nothing like a U47" but is liked on its own merits |
| [[Neumann U87]] | More versatile all-rounder; cian riordan: "a single mic to blow your wad on? Gimme an 87 any day" |

## Common Mistakes

- Chasing the U47 sound as your first or only high-end mic. The specialized midrange character makes it a poor general-purpose choice compared to an 87 or 251.
- Assuming all U47s sound the same. The wide part tolerances of the 1950s-60s manufacturing mean individual vintage units vary dramatically -- some are legendary, others are just old.
- Spending $10K+ on a vintage unit without renting one first. Cian riordan advises: "spend the balance on renting a nice U47 to see if that's really something worth chasing."
- Trusting AI-generated research on mic circuits and technical details. One community member ran a deep research query and the mic designer responded: "The text quoted from my website is correct. Everything else is wrong."
