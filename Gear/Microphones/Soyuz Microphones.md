# Soyuz Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Soyuz is a Russian microphone manufacturer that has earned serious respect among professional engineers for building modern microphones that stand on their own merits rather than chasing vintage replicas. The community repeatedly praises their build quality, tonal richness, and the fact that they are "doing their own thing." NoahNeedleman is a vocal champion of the brand, and multiple engineers report choosing Soyuz over mics costing two to three times as much in blind shootouts. The 017 (both Tube and FET) is their flagship vocal mic, while the 013 FET small diaphragm condenser and the Bomblet have carved out devoted followings for instrument duties.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large and small diaphragm condensers (tube and FET variants)
- **Notable Models:** [[Soyuz 017]] (Tube & FET), 023, 013 FET SDC, Bomblet, Launcher
- **Notable Features:** Russian K67 capsules, exceptional build quality, unique tonal character that avoids the "mid-focus opacity" of modern Neumanns and the "brittle top end" of some competitors

## Use Cases

Soyuz microphones are praised across a wide range of applications. The 017 Tube is considered an elite vocal mic that provides "a very complete sound" on every vocal it captures. Engineers use it as their primary LDC for both male and female vocals, acoustic guitars, and general tracking. The 013 FET SDC has been called "incredible" on drum overheads and violin, with one user choosing it over [[Neumann KM184]] after a side-by-side comparison, finding the Soyuz "sounded more life-like." The Bomblet excels as a kick drum mic -- one engineer called it his favorite by "a good margin" over U47 FETs and AKG D30s, noting something about "the way the Soyuz distorts or just reacts" that produces ideal thickness and attack.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The 017 Tube is the go-to for vocals when a rich, full-spectrum sound is desired; the FET version is preferred when a brighter, more forward vocal is needed
- On kick drum, the Bomblet placed on the outside paired with a Beta 52 on the batter side is a winning combination
- The 013 FET paired with a [[Coles 4038]] makes an excellent violin recording setup
- NoahNeedleman conducted a 36-mic shootout at Vintage King and chose the Soyuz 017 Tube as his main vocal mic
- One engineer reports pairing the 017 with a BAE 1073D preamp with excellent results

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Telefunken Microphones\|Telefunken TF29]] | Similar concept at different price point; community found the Soyuz "richer all the way through the spectrum" |
| [[Lauten Audio Eden]] | Comparable price range for a versatile vocal mic; Eden offers multi-voicing switches |
| [[Neumann KM184]] | The 013 FET competes directly and was preferred by some for sounding more natural |
| [[Flea Microphones]] | Flea excels at vintage U47 replication; Soyuz offers its own distinct character |
| [[Bock Microphones\|UA Bock 251]] | One engineer chose the UA Bock 251 over the Soyuz 017 after extensive shootouts |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming the FET and Tube versions of the 017 sound the same -- they have meaningfully different characters and excel in different contexts
- Overlooking the Bomblet and 013 as "lesser" models -- both are highly regarded for specific instrument applications
- Expecting a U47 clone -- Soyuz deliberately avoids replication in favor of original designs with modern engineering
