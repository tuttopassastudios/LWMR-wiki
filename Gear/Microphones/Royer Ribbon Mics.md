# Royer Ribbon Mics

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Royer Labs is a ribbon microphone manufacturer best known for the R121, designed by David Royer (who also founded [[Mojave Microphones]]). Community opinion on Royer is notably divisive. While the R121 remains an industry standard with a reputation built partly on its use in the Thriller drum sound, certain prominent community members are vocally critical. Cian riordan's colorful disdain for the brand is a running joke in the server, with quips like calling them "failures of human engineering" and "terrible for recording acoustic instruments in real space." Others find value in specific models like the SF-12 stereo ribbon, though the overall sentiment leans toward recommending [[AEA Microphones]], [[Coles 4038]], or Beyerdynamic ribbons instead.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Ribbon microphones (passive and active variants)
- **Notable Models:** R121, R101, R10, SF-12 (stereo)
- **Notable Features:** Compact ribbon design, industry-standard status in certain circles, David Royer pedigree

## Use Cases

The R121 is traditionally used on guitar amplifiers, drum overheads, and horns. The SF-12 stereo ribbon is specifically praised -- "Royer SF-12 is pretty nice." The R10 is their budget entry but community members find it "low output and not great with quiet sources noise-wise." Some engineers pair a Royer with an [[Shure SM57]] on guitar cabinets using phase alignment techniques. However, the prevailing recommendation is often to look elsewhere: "Save the money on the Royer and dig into some big boy LDCs."

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[AEA R84]] | Strongly preferred by community; "better mics" according to multiple engineers |
| [[Coles 4038]] | "I'd get a single Coles 4038 light years before getting any Royers" |
| Beyerdynamic M160 | Hypercardioid ribbon; community often recommends over Royer |
| Stager SR1A | Recommended as alternative big alnico ribbon |
| Audio-Technica AT4081 | Active ribbon alternative mentioned alongside Royer in mic lists |
