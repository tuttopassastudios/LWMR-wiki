# AEA R44

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The AEA R44 is a faithful recreation of the legendary RCA 44 ribbon microphone, one of the most important microphones in recording history. The community holds it in reverence -- "Can't beat the R44. So many amazing vocals captured with it." Engineers who have compared the AEA recreation to vintage RCA originals find them "mostly the same," with the AEA having "more defined top end" and slightly higher output due to different magnet materials. Available in passive (R44C), active (R44CX), and enhanced active (R44CXE) variants.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Ribbon microphone
- **Polar Pattern:** Figure-8
- **Notable Features:** Big alnico magnet structure, faithful RCA 44 recreation, available in passive and active variants, R44CXE has ~6dB more output than passive version
- **Variants:** R44C (passive), R44CX (active, modified transducer), R44CXE (enhanced active)

## Use Cases

The R44 is prized for vocals, guitars, horns, and room duties. "R44 on guitars all day!" captures the enthusiasm for its instrument work. For vocals, the noise floor can be a concern on quiet sources -- one engineer asks "How do y'all keep noise down when using the AEA R44 on vocals?" and notes that even with high-quality preamps (Great River, API) and a Cloudlifter, hiss can be problematic on quiet passages. The R44CXE eliminates this issue with its higher output. It also works as a room mic, though its figure-8 pattern means the room itself is critical.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The R44CXE eliminates the need for gain boosters entirely, unlike the passive R84, R88, and [[Coles 4038]]
- For quiet sources on passive versions, RX de-noising may be necessary -- though engineers feel they "shouldn't have to"
- Re-ribboning vintage RCA 44s provides a significant improvement -- "it's usually a free lunch... they'll sound so much better"
- AEA recommends using XLR patch bays or no patch bay at all -- something in their documentation specifically addresses this

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| RCA 44 (vintage) | Original design; "a good sounding R44 and RCA 44 will be almost indistinguishable" |
| [[AEA R84]] | Smaller, more affordable AEA ribbon; more versatile but less commanding |
| Melodium 42Bn | Another "big alnico ribbon mic" contender |
| Stager SR1A | Big alnico ribbon alternative considered alongside R44 |
| [[Coles 4038]] | Different ribbon character; both are studio classics |
