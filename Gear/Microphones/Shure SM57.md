# Shure SM57

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Shure SM57 is the most ubiquitous dynamic microphone in recording, a standard for snare drums and guitar amplifiers that has remained essentially unchanged for decades. The community treats it as a fundamental tool -- "a surprisingly good vocal mic with a pop filter" and a mic that "just sounds perfectly consistent on guitar and vocals." Despite its low price, it is compared favorably to far more expensive mics, with one member noting the Gefell "beats out the modern 87 by a huge margin (but so does an SM57 imo)." However, the community also notes that SM57s are "notoriously inconsistent" from unit to unit, which is ironic given their status as a standard.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Dynamic
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** Unidyne III capsule (shared with SM58), extremely durable, industry standard for snare and guitar cabinets, ~$99 price point

## Use Cases

The SM57 is used on virtually every session in some capacity:
- **Snare drum:** The default choice; one engineer has a "specific Unidyne III SM57 that is slightly better for me on snare and electric guitar" than vintage alternatives
- **Guitar amplifiers:** Standard close-mic on cabinets, often paired with a ribbon or condenser for blending
- **Vocals:** Underrated as a vocal mic with a pop filter; it smooths out the 2kHz range
- **Toms:** Usable though community generally prefers Audix D6 or AKG C414 for toms
- Vintage SM57s with original Unidyne III capsules are reported to sound "way better than stock 57s"

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Pairs with ribbons or condensers on guitar cabinets for blended tones -- a 3D-printed bracket can hold an SDC and SM57 on one stand
- Vintage units may outperform modern ones, but the variation between individual 57s is notable
- On snare, positioning matters more than the mic itself -- the SM57 is forgiving of placement
- The Crimson Audio modification is available for SM57s seeking enhanced performance

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Shure SM58]] | Same Unidyne III capsule, different grille and body; SM58 has more pop protection for vocals |
| Sennheiser MD421 | More expensive dynamic; different character on toms and cabinets |
| Audix i5 | Direct SM57 competitor; different tonal balance |
| Austrian Audio OC818 | "SM57, Coles 4038, and Austrian Audio OC818 are pretty much my 3 favorite mics" |
| [[Electro-Voice RE20]] | Step up in fidelity for vocals and kick applications |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming all SM57s sound the same -- "Nothing drives me crazier than how inconsistent V30s and SM57s are from one to the next"
- Not trying it on vocals -- it can be surprisingly effective with proper placement and a pop filter
- Overlooking the Crimson Audio modification as a way to enhance stock SM57 performance

## Recording-Talk Perspectives

- cian riordan uses 57 on top snare as standard -- part of the "4 mic drum setup" alongside d12 and KM184s
- thecoleyoung: Troubleshot a lifeless-sounding 4-mic drum setup (57, D12, KM184s) -- turned out to be monitoring issues, not the mics
- cian riordan on the 57's limitations: "The only thing more underwhelming than an SM57 is one with the transformer taken out. I love the mic, but c'mon, I think there are broader stroke decisions we could be making in mic choice here."
- Zack Hames conducted a detailed SM57 shootout: 4 vintage Unidyne III SM57s, 4 modern SM57s, and 3 SM58s with grills removed, all tested on electric guitar
