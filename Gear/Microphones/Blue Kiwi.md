# Blue Kiwi

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Blue Kiwi is a large diaphragm condenser from Blue Microphones (now owned by Logitech) that has earned a loyal following among engineers who own older production units. One engineer calls it "a constant workhorse for me, beats out my M930 very often." The key distinction is between older (pre-Logitech) units and current production -- "the old sticker baby bottle and kiwi rock." The Kiwi serves as a reliable vocal and general-purpose LDC, though the brand's future in professional audio is uncertain following the Logitech acquisition.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern
- **Notable Features:** Distinctive Blue Microphones aesthetic, older units prized over newer production

## Use Cases

The Kiwi is used as a vocal microphone and LDC workhorse. One engineer includes it in their vocal mic rotation alongside a [[Microtech Gefell|Gefell M930]], Lucas CS-1, and Vanguard V13. The workflow described: "Lucas CS-1 if that's not working the Kiwi for LDC stuff, and if that doesn't work I move dynamic to an RE20 or Ribbon with a Coles 4038." It sits comfortably in the mid-tier of a well-equipped mic locker.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Microtech Gefell\|Gefell M930]] | Kiwi sometimes beats it; different tonal character |
| Lucas CS-1 | Both serve as vocal LDC options; different voicing |
| Vanguard V13 | Both tube-era-inspired condensers at accessible prices |
| [[Lauten Audio Eden]] | Modern multi-voicing alternative |
| [[Rode NT1]] | Much cheaper; different league |
