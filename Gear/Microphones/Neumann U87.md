# Neumann U87

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neumann U87 is the studio workhorse large diaphragm condenser that has anchored vocal chains and instrument recordings for over five decades. It is not always the most exciting mic in the locker, but it is the one that almost never fails. Community members describe it as "the Corolla of mics" -- it may not wow you on every source, but there is an exceedingly high chance it will not suck. Its versatility and reliability make it a foundational piece for any serious studio.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser (FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern (cardioid, omni, figure-8)
- **Notable Features:** Switchable polar patterns, -10dB pad, low-cut filter, extremely high SPL handling (127dB), K67/K87 capsule depending on era

## Use Cases

Engineers reach for the U87 when they need a safe, reliable choice on nearly any source. It excels on lead vocals where stacking and layering are required, as it takes EQ and compression remarkably well. It sees regular use on acoustic instruments, guitar amplifiers (it can handle amp SPLs without issue), drum room duties, and broadcast applications. As SoundsLikeJoe noted, "The 87 has a very specific sound. It can/does work on most things, and some things/voices it pairs up in a magic way." However, community members stress that for certain singers a dynamic mic like the SM7B or even a Beta 58 may be a better match. The U87 is not always "the" vocal mic, but it is always a usable one.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Vintage U87i models (pre-1986) are generally preferred over modern U87ai versions, which community members find brighter and sometimes harsh
- Pairs well with virtually any quality preamp -- UTA MPEQ-1, Neve-style, Chandler, Hazzelrigg, or even console pres. Cian riordan notes the nuances between preamps are "FAR less important than the differences between microphones, positioning, room, compression choice"
- Cardioid is the go-to pattern for vocals; omni can be excellent for room ambience and acoustic instruments
- Typically placed 6-12 inches from the vocalist with a pop filter
- Takes additive EQ and compression exceptionally well during mixing, making it forgiving in the tracking stage

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Neumann U67]] | Tube predecessor, warmer and more "alive" sounding, significantly more expensive |
| [[Neumann TLM 103]] | Budget-friendly Neumann alternative, same capsule family, but lacks the U87's multi-pattern and full-bodied midrange |
| [[AKG C414]] | Another multi-pattern workhorse; community finds vintage EB models superior to modern XLS versions |
| Chandler TG Mic | A $2K alternative praised for tube-like flavor from a FET design |
| Peluso P87 | Clone option with "old world build quality," though capsules may not match originals |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming a new U87ai will sound like a vintage U87i. Community consensus is strong: the modern versions are brighter and less forgiving. As one member put it, "I know no one loves the Ai's."
- Buying a vintage unit without having it inspected. Dirty capsules cause dramatic level drops and require professional cleaning -- distilled water, cotton buds, steady hands, and ideally a specialist like David Brown (LA) or Toby Foster.
- Overpaying for "the name." SoundsLikeJoe warns that "vintage pricing includes the myth markup" and suggests the same budget might be better spent on high-quality newly made microphones.
- Using it on every vocalist without auditioning alternatives. The U87's specific midrange character does not flatter every voice.
