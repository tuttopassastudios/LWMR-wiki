# Lewitt LCT 940

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Lewitt LCT 940 is a hybrid tube/FET large diaphragm condenser that has earned a devoted following for its ability to convincingly emulate far more expensive microphones. Its most remarkable claim: in FET mode, it "sounds legitimately identical" to the [[Sony C-800G]] according to one community member, verified via Audio Test Kitchen comparisons. The 940 offers continuously variable blending between tube and FET circuits, variable polar patterns, and hypercardioid capability. Rob Domos is the most vocal advocate, with his recommendation directly influencing multiple purchases in the community.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser (hybrid tube/FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Variable (including hypercardioid)
- **Notable Features:** Continuously variable tube/FET blend, C-800G comparable in FET mode, tube swapping capability, hypercardioid option

## Use Cases

The LCT 940 is primarily used as a vocal microphone, serving as a budget stand-in for the C-800G in pop and hip-hop production. One engineer uses it specifically as their "bright mic (C800) stand-in" alongside a [[Soyuz 017]] Tube for warmer applications. The full FET mode works best on female vocalists but can sound "too thin/hollow on rap vox." Tube swapping with a vintage Telefunken ribbed plate ECC83 "completely changes the mic" by adding midrange focus, with one engineer noting it "solved an issue I had with it."

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- FET mode for C-800G emulation on bright pop vocals
- Tube/FET blend for warmer, more natural applications
- Hypercardioid pattern "sounds even better" than standard cardioid according to one user
- Vintage tube swap (Siemens ECC83 or Telefunken ribbed plate) dramatically improves midrange focus
- The tube swap process "is not easy" but yields transformative results

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Sony C-800G]] | "Sounds legitimately identical for only $1,700" in FET mode |
| Lewitt LCT 1040 | Flagship successor; "even a little closer to natural sounding" |
| Lewitt LCT-840 | More affordable Lewitt; different character |
| [[Soyuz 017]] | Pairs well as complementary mic; Soyuz for warmth, 940 for brightness |
| [[Neumann U87]] | 940 offers more tonal flexibility through variable blend |
