# Bock Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Bock Microphones, founded by David Bock (previously Soundelux), is renowned for their 251 and 47-style large diaphragm condensers. The brand was acquired by Universal Audio, creating the "UA Bock" line. The community holds the original Bock and Soundelux mics in high esteem -- "one of the few modern manufacturers that gets it right" according to cian riordan. The 251 clone is the most discussed model, with engineers praising it as a reliable, high-quality modern alternative to vintage originals. However, there is active debate about whether the UA-manufactured versions sound identical to the original boutique Bock mics.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm tube condensers
- **Notable Models:** Bock 251, Bock 47, Soundelux 251, UA Bock 251
- **Notable Features:** Handmade boutique construction (original Bock), extended high-frequency response compared to vintage 251s

## Use Cases

The Bock 251 is primarily used as a vocal microphone, with one engineer declaring "my search for a main LDC is finally over" after choosing it. It is also regularly deployed on acoustic instruments and general studio duties. One studio reports having used a pair of Bock 251s reliably for over 10 years. Engineers note the Bock 251 has a characteristic that is "too thick in the low end and not bright enough sometimes" compared to a Telefunken 251E, which some view as a feature and others as a limitation.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The UA Bock 251 and original Bock 251 are confirmed to sound different -- one engineer who compared them side by side found "more different than I thought they'd be" and actually preferred the UA version
- One engineer tested the UA Bock against Chandler Redd, Manley Gold, U67ri, Soyuz 017, Gefell UMT70/M930, and U87ai -- and the UA Bock won
- UA Bock does not service original (pre-merger) Bock mics, which is a significant consideration for used purchases
- The Bock 251 pairs well with tube preamps for a saturated vocal sound or cleaner preamps when more transparency is desired

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Telefunken Microphones\|Telefunken 251E]] | Brighter, more air on top; several engineers have upgraded from Bock to Telefunken 251E |
| [[AKG-Telefunken 251]] | The vintage original; astronomically expensive and inconsistent |
| Soundelux 251 | Predecessor to the Bock 251; "pretty sure the Soundelux 251 IS a Bock 251" |
| Heiserman 251 | Newer contender; "strikingly similar to the Bock 251 thing" |
| [[Warm Audio WA-251]] | Budget alternative; not in the same league sonically |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming UA Bock and original Bock mics sound identical -- they do not, due to different manufacturing processes
- Expecting UA to service pre-merger Bock microphones -- they will not
- Not considering a Telefunken 251E if brightness and air are priorities -- the Bock tends thicker and darker
