# AKG-Telefunken 251

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The ELA M 251 is one of the most revered large diaphragm tube condensers ever made, sitting alongside the U47 and C12 in the holy trinity of vintage microphones. Originally manufactured by AKG and distributed by Telefunken in the late 1950s, the 251 is prized for its airy top end, rich harmonic content, and ability to flatter nearly any vocal. Community consensus is emphatic: a good 251 is "something worth experiencing." It is one of the most discussed and aspirational microphones in the community, with 219 total matches across 116 threads -- more than any other single mic.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm tube condenser
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern (cardioid, omni, figure-8)
- **Notable Features:** CK12 capsule (vintage), tube circuit with harmonic richness, airy high-end character, multiple modern reissues from various manufacturers

## Use Cases

The 251 is the desert island vocal mic for many professional engineers. It flatters a wide range of voices and sits in a mix with minimal processing. BatMeckley, the community's most prolific 251 advocate (25 mentions), uses it as a primary vocal mic and considers it essential for professional vocal work. The mic also excels on acoustic instruments, strings, and as a drum overhead or room mic. Zack Hames notes that "a FET 47 vs a 251 vs an Audio Technica 4050 is way more drastic than a Neve vs SSL vs UAD vs Focusrite," underlining that mic choice matters far more than preamp selection. The 251 is often the mic that engineers recommend when someone asks about upgrading from mid-tier condensers.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Cardioid for close vocal work; figure-8 for Blumlein stereo pairs or when rear rejection is not critical
- Pairs well with transformer-based preamps (Neve, BAE, UTA) to complement its airy character with low-mid warmth
- Vintage units require careful handling and climate-controlled storage; the internal plastics can deteriorate over decades
- BatMeckley advises buying new for working purposes: vintage 251s are "hard to take care of, inconsistent, and just an overall pain in the ass"
- The mic benefits from a warm-up period of 15-30 minutes before critical tracking

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| Telefunken ELA M 251E (reissue) | BatMeckley: "Telefunken still makes the best 251." Current production models sound very good per David Fuller |
| Bock 251 | "A bit quicker and a bit harder" per BatMeckley; well-regarded alternative |
| Upton 251 | Praised as "glorious" sounding; quality boutique option |
| Flea 251 | Toby Foster speaks highly of them; reportedly on par with Telefunken reissues |
| Heiserman 251 | New entrant generating curiosity; Josh: "I still really want to hear that Heiserman 251 in person" |
| Warm Audio WA-251 | Budget entry point; community acknowledges it as a decent stepping stone |
| [[AKG C12]] | Related lineage, shares the CK12 capsule; more hi-fi and detailed |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming Telefunken USA has lineage to the original manufacturer. Nomograph Mastering clarifies: "Telefunken mics now shares no lineage or engineering with the original company, they literally licensed the name from Klaus Heyne and started from scratch." Judge the mics on merit, not the brand name.
- Chasing vintage units as investments when you need a working tool. The deteriorating internal plastics and inconsistency of vintage 251s make them impractical for daily studio use.
- Overlooking quality alternatives like the Bock, Upton, or Flea to fixate on the Telefunken name. James Redfern: "I like the Bock and the Upton. Can't say I've tried them all though."
- Spending on a 251 before having a quality preamp and signal chain to support it, though community consensus suggests the mic matters far more than the preamp.
