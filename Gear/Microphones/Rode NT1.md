# Rode NT1

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Rode NT1 is a budget large diaphragm condenser that generates highly polarized opinions in the community. Original/early models (pre-2005) are held in surprisingly high regard -- one member who used them in Melbourne studios would "put it up next to most U87s." However, modern revisions receive far less praise, with one engineer calling it "one of the most unusable condenser mics I've ever come across." The key distinction is between the original NT1 (black body, redesigned capsule), the NT1A (gold body, older capsule), and the NT1 5th Gen. Community consensus: early Rode mics "sound amazing," but vintage NTs are a different animal from current production.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser (FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** Very low self-noise, budget-friendly price point, multiple revisions with different capsule designs

## Use Cases

The NT1 is widely used as a first "real" microphone for home studios and beginning engineers. It works adequately on vocals in untreated or semi-treated rooms due to its cardioid pattern. Some rap and pop producers prefer it for its specific tonal character -- "Rode is for rap, SM7B is for rock" as one member quipped. The 30 Seconds to Mars Grammy-winning record reportedly used an NT1 for vocals (with an SM7B for screams). However, multiple engineers relegate it to backup duty or closet storage once better mics are acquired.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The black NT1 (redesigned capsule) sounds "way nicer" than the gold NT1A
- Early/vintage NT1 models from the early 2000s are the most desirable revision
- If experiencing sibilance issues, check compressor settings and mic placement before blaming the mic
- Benefits from a quality preamp -- a 1073-style pre can bring out significantly more character

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Shure SM7B]] | Preferred by many for vocals in untreated rooms; dynamic vs condenser tradeoffs |
| [[Audio-Technica AT2020]] | Similar price tier; AT2020 has a "sharp feel" that some find worse |
| Rode NT1A | Same family but older capsule design; NT1 (black) generally preferred |
| [[Rode Microphones\|Rode NTK]] | Tube version; significantly different character |
| Rode Classic II | "Might as well not even be from the same manufacturer" |

## Common Mistakes

- Not knowing which NT1 revision you are buying -- the differences between versions are substantial
- Using it when a dynamic mic would be more appropriate for the room and source
- Expecting it to compete with mid-range condensers -- it is a $100-200 mic and should be evaluated accordingly
