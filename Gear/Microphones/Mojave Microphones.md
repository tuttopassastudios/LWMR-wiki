# Mojave Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Mojave Audio is a microphone manufacturer founded by David Royer (of [[Royer Ribbon Mics]] fame). Community opinion is mixed -- "Mojaves -- for the record -- are wonderful" says one engineer, while cian riordan flatly states "I've never heard a Mojave / Royer that I've liked." The [[Mojave MA-200]] and MA-201 are the most discussed models, offering tube and FET condenser options at accessible price points. The brand occupies a middle ground between budget clones and premium boutique mics, with some legendary prototype mics existing that David Royer himself acknowledges may have "the perfect amount of Mojave dust in them."

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condensers (tube and FET)
- **Notable Models:** [[Mojave MA-200]], MA-201 FET, MA-201, MA-300, MA-3000
- **Notable Features:** David Royer pedigree, accessible pricing for tube condensers, various U67/U87-inspired designs

## Use Cases

The MA-200 and MA-201 are used as vocal microphones in indie pop, singer-songwriter, and general studio applications. The MA-201 FET is noted for occasional RF interference issues. One member uses it alongside an SM7B as their "main vocal mics" for indie pop. The MA-3000 received positive feedback in comparisons with Warm Audio and Golden Age products. The MA-201 is positioned as a sub-$1K alternative that is "an excellent version of itself rather than a cut-rate version of a 47."

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Microtech Gefell\|Gefell M930]] | Similar price range; Gefell generally more recommended by community |
| [[Warm Audio]] | Both serve mid-price segment; quality comparison varies by model |
| [[Audio-Technica AT4050]] | Similar price; AT4050 considered more neutral and versatile |
| Shure KSM44 | Both sub-$1K LDCs recommended as solid workhorse mics |
| Austrian Audio OC18 | Modern competitor at similar price point |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming the MA-201 sounds like a vintage 251 based on frequency response graphs alone -- "a 201 is not like a 251 AT ALL in actual use"
- Not investigating RF interference issues on the MA-201 FET before purchase
- Comparing Mojave directly to the prototype one-off mics that exist at Rancho de Luna -- those are unicorns
