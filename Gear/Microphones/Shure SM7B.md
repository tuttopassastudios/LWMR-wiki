# Shure SM7B

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Shure SM7B is a dynamic cardioid microphone that has become one of the most debated and widely used mics in modern recording. It is simultaneously loved and loathed by working engineers -- NoahNeedleman champions it while his Grammy-winning colleague Craig Bauer "HATES" it. The truth lies in understanding what the SM7B does well: it rejects room noise, takes EQ and compression beautifully, and works on loud singers and in untreated rooms where condensers fall apart. It is on countless hit records, from Michael Jackson's "Thriller" to Jeff Tweedy's Wilco vocals, and has become the default home studio and podcast microphone. With 153 matches across 68 threads, it is one of the most discussed mics in the community.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Dynamic
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** Built-in air suspension shock isolation, switchable bass rolloff and mid-range emphasis (presence boost), removable windscreen, extremely tight pickup pattern for room rejection

## Use Cases

The SM7B shines on loud singers and in untreated recording environments. TALLL notes it "usually works best on loud singers" and that "you can record it with the speakers on in the room and some singers like to record without headphones." Oaklandmatt recounts recording the Hives vocalist Pelle using "an SM7 on a mic stand with two stage monitors out of phase in front of him" -- the SM7's rejection made it work. It is the go-to for rock vocals, podcast/broadcast work, and handheld tracking sessions where singers prefer mobility. Several writers oaklandmatt works with "love a handheld SM7." Eric Martin notes that "SM7/SM7b is on lots of hits" including Wilco's lead vocal recordings. It also sees use on guitar amps and as a broadcast mic, though some engineers find it lacks the detail and air of a condenser.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- A Cloudlifter or similar inline gain booster is nearly essential. Eric Martin explains it "works with the preamp to supply an extended amount of gain (+25dB) for preamps that get noisy when you turn them up loud enough"
- Without adequate gain, the noise floor becomes problematic. Josh: "mine would sound fine through my twin until I'd mix it and the noise floor was wild"
- Remove the windscreen for more high-end detail -- several members track with the foam off, though this requires careful plosive management
- The presence boost switch adds clarity that helps the mic cut through dense mixes
- Blanco recommends "SM7 with Cloudlifter. UAD pre and comp. Stock stuff is fine -- 610 and 2A"
- Position the singer very close and maintain consistent distance; mic technique matters more with dynamics than condensers

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| Electro-Voice RE20 | "Super slept on" per blanco; sounds more like a condenser, no proximity effect, also great in untreated rooms |
| Shure SM57 | BoozleBAM prefers his vocals through a 57 over the SM7B; less low end, more mid bite |
| Shure SM58 | The handheld stage standard; many engineers prefer it for live-in-studio tracking |
| Sennheiser MD 441 | More hi-fi and full-range than most dynamics; needs distance from diaphragm |
| [[Neumann U87]] | Completely different flavor; condenser detail vs. dynamic rejection tradeoff |

## Common Mistakes

- Using it without enough gain. The SM7B needs 50-60dB of clean gain. Running it through a budget interface without an inline boost results in a noisy, thin sound that members describe as sounding "like a USB mic."
- Assuming it is the right mic for every vocalist. Eric Martin warns: "I don't love the SM7b... I've had to fix more issues with people using that mic than I've had things that sound great with it." It is source-dependent.
- Not learning the mic before judging it. Josh admitted he "thought I hated the SM7b because I just never learned the mic" until he heard an engineer get stunning results through a simple Focusrite Clarett with virtual processing.
- Ignoring mic technique. Because it is a dynamic, the singer must stay close and consistent. Distance variations cause dramatic tonal shifts.
- Treating it as a budget compromise. In the right application, it competes with and sometimes beats mics costing ten times as much.
