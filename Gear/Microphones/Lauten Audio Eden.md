# Lauten Audio Eden

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Lauten Audio Eden (LT-386) is the flagship microphone from [[Lauten Audio]], designed as a versatile vocal workhorse for male and female voices plus acoustic instruments. Its defining feature is the FNG (Forward/Neutral/Gentle) voicing switch that provides three distinct tonal characters in one microphone. The community is broadly positive -- "Love my Eden! Have had it for a few years" -- though some voices find it "a bit harsh in the upper mids and/or lacking in the lower mids." A quality preamp is considered essential to getting the best results. The Eden is frequently recommended as a strong alternative to the [[Neumann U87]] at a lower price point.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condenser (FET)
- **Polar Pattern:** Multi-pattern
- **Notable Features:** FNG voicing switch (Forward/Neutral/Gentle), multi-pattern capability, three-mic-in-one versatility

## Use Cases

The Eden excels as a primary vocal microphone across genres and voice types. Engineers use it as the centerpiece of their vocal chain -- one engineer tracks through Eden > Apollo 8, while another runs Eden > BAE 1073. It is also recommended for acoustic guitars. The multi-voicing is genuinely useful: "the multi voicing is really like having 3 different mics which is dope." For engineers seeking a $3K vocal mic, the Eden is consistently in the conversation alongside the U87, Soyuz 017, and Gefell M930.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Forward voicing adds presence and air; Gentle rolls off the top for warmer, darker sources
- A quality preamp (BAE 1073, Shelford Channel) makes "a huge difference" with this mic
- Sibilance management is important -- pair with a good pop filter and consider the Pauly superscreen
- The multi-voicing switch is not gimmicky -- actively use it during tracking to find the best match for each singer

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Neumann U87]] | Eden offers multi-voicing versatility that U87 lacks; competes at lower price |
| [[Soyuz 017]] | Both recommended as workhorse vocal mics; Soyuz has richer single voice, Eden has flexibility |
| [[Microtech Gefell\|Gefell M930]] | Different philosophy; Gefell is more neutral, Eden is more colored/flexible |
| Lauten Atlantis | Eden's more affordable sibling; one engineer sold their Manley Ref C after getting the Atlantis |
| Manley Reference Cardioid | Higher-end alternative; some find the Eden comparable |
