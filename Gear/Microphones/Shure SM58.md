# Shure SM58

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Shure SM58 is the most iconic live vocal microphone ever made and a surprisingly capable studio tool. "SM58! It's a legend for a reason" sums up the community's respect for this workhorse. It shares the same Unidyne III capsule as the [[Shure SM57]], with the primary differences being the grille design, body shape, and pop protection. Community members note that with a thick foam cover at about 4 inches from the mouth, an SM58 sounds "much closer than people expect" to an [[Shure SM7B]]. Under $300 for a vocal mic? "I would honestly get an SM58, personally."

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Dynamic
- **Polar Pattern:** Cardioid
- **Notable Features:** Same Unidyne III capsule as SM57 and SM7B, integrated windscreen/pop filter, legendary durability, industry standard for live vocals

## Use Cases

While primarily a live vocal mic, the SM58 has legitimate studio applications. One engineer used SM58s on drum overheads with "quite good" results. It works well as a room/drum-god mic -- one example describes an SM58 "hanging out from the ceiling in a big warehouse type space" through CLM Dynamics preamps. The car metaphor applies: "sometimes you just need an SM58" -- it is the Miata of microphones, not the fanciest but possibly the most fun. For soft/rock vocals, it is a legitimate contender alongside the SM57.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Shure SM57]] | Same capsule, different grille; SM57 brighter due to grille proximity, SM58 has pop protection |
| [[Shure SM7B]] | Same capsule family; SM7B has more body and rejection, but "shockingly similar" to SM58 with foam cover |
| [[Telefunken Microphones\|Telefunken M80]] | "Sound incredible" but 3x the price |
| Crimson Audio Mod | Available modification for enhanced SM57/SM58 performance |
| [[Electro-Voice RE20]] | Step up for studio vocal applications |
