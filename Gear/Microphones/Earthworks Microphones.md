# Earthworks Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Earthworks is a microphone manufacturer known for their ultra-flat, transparent measurement-grade and studio microphones. The community respects their accuracy but notes they lack the musical coloration many engineers want for tracking. "I always want vocal mics to have a little high-mid pop and find the Earthworks are all uncannily flat in that regard" captures the common sentiment. They excel in specific applications like drum overheads and measurement, but for vocal tracking, most engineers prefer mics with more tonal character.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Small diaphragm condensers, measurement microphones
- **Notable Models:** SR314, various omni and cardioid models
- **Notable Features:** Exceptionally flat frequency response, measurement-grade accuracy, high-quality build

## Use Cases

Earthworks mics are recommended for drum overheads (especially omni models in untreated spaces), measurement applications, and piano recording where transparency is desired. One engineer got "pretty damn cool drum overhead sounds with Earthworks omnis in an untreated NYC apartment." They can be picky about phantom power supply quality -- "I've had experiences with Earthworks mics and Cloudlifters cutting out" with inconsistent phantom power from 500-series preamps. For vocal duties, most engineers prefer a dynamic mic over Earthworks.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Schoeps Microphones]] | Both prioritize accuracy; Schoeps generally considered higher tier |
| [[DPA Microphones]] | Similar transparent philosophy; DPA has broader product range |
| Josephson C617 | More expensive but similar transparency goals |
| [[Neumann KM184]] | More musical/colored; many prefer KM184 for studio work |
