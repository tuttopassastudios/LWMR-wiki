# AEA Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Audio Engineering Associates (AEA) is the premier modern manufacturer of ribbon microphones, best known for their recreation of the legendary RCA 44 and their own designs like the R84, R92, and N8. The community regards AEA as the gold standard for ribbon mics, with engineers praising their natural sound, build quality, and versatility. AEA also manufactures ribbon-optimized preamps (RPQ) that are specifically designed to pair with their high-impedance ribbon designs.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Ribbon microphones (passive and active variants)
- **Polar Pattern:** Figure-8 (inherent to ribbon design)
- **Notable Models:** [[AEA R44]], [[AEA R84]], R92, R88, N8
- **Notable Features:** High-impedance design philosophy, active variants for modern preamp compatibility, RPQ preamp with built-in curve bender EQ

## Use Cases

AEA ribbons find use across virtually every source in the studio. The [[AEA R44]] is considered definitive for vocals, horns, and room miking, with one engineer declaring "so many amazing vocals captured with it." The [[AEA R84]] is the community's go-to entry point for ribbon mics, praised as "very versatile, more so than a Coles." The R92 excels on electric guitars, percussion, and hi-hat, while also delivering strong results on flute and vocals through the RPQ preamp. The N8 is favored for outdoor and location recording. Multiple engineers use AEA ribbons on drum overheads, acoustic instruments, and as room mics in both close and distant configurations.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- AEA's high-impedance design philosophy means their passive mics pair best with high-impedance preamps -- their own RPQ is purpose-built for this
- Active models (R84A, R44CXE) solve gain issues with standard preamps and eliminate the need for external boosters like [[Cloudlifter]]
- The R44 CXE has approximately 6dB more output than the passive R44C, eliminating the need for gain boosters
- For quiet sources, noise can be a concern with passive ribbons -- consider active variants or high-gain, low-noise preamps like Great River or API
- The RPQ preamp includes a curve bender EQ that pairs exceptionally well with ribbon mics

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Coles 4038]] | Classic British ribbon; community finds AEA more versatile overall |
| [[Royer Ribbon Mics\|Royer R121]] | Popular alternative; some community members strongly prefer AEA over Royer |
| RCA 44 (vintage) | AEA R44 is a faithful recreation; vintage units can be inconsistent but "weightier" sounding |
| Beyerdynamic M160 | Hypercardioid ribbon; a "sleeper choice" that adds midrange character |
| Stager SR1A | Another big alnico ribbon contender in the same category |

## Common Mistakes

- Using low-impedance preamp settings with passive AEA ribbons -- AEA specifically advocates for high-impedance loading
- Assuming all ribbon mics need a Cloudlifter -- active AEA models have sufficient output for most preamps
- Not considering the room when using figure-8 ribbons -- the rear pickup pattern captures significant room sound
