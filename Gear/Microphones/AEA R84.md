# AEA R84

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The AEA R84 is the community's most recommended entry point into ribbon microphones. Praised as "a great entry into the world of ribbon mics" with versatility that exceeds the [[Coles 4038]], the R84 delivers the warm, natural ribbon sound at an accessible price point. Multiple engineers describe it as "magical" and find it works exceptionally well on vocals, horns, acoustic instruments, and even kick drums. The active R84A variant solves gain and impedance matching challenges that come with passive ribbon mics.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Ribbon microphone
- **Polar Pattern:** Figure-8
- **Notable Features:** Available in passive (R84) and active (R84A) versions, big ribbon element, smooth high-frequency rolloff characteristic of ribbon design

## Use Cases

The R84 excels on sources where sibilance and high-frequency harshness are problems. Engineers with "annoying 4-5kHz dominance" in their voice find it smooths things out compared to condensers. It is specifically praised for:
- **Vocals:** "The R84 has been magical every time I've used it" and it is "pretty magic for both vocals and acoustics"
- **Horns and winds:** "Beautiful on horns, winds, and strings (upright bass)"
- **Kick drum:** Excellent results 12-24 inches from the head, "especially with a blanket draped over it"
- **Acoustic guitar:** A top recommendation for tracking acoustics
- One engineer found the R84 was the best pairing match with a [[Soyuz 017]] for stereo vocal tracking

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The R84A (active) eliminates the need for external gain boosters like [[Cloudlifter]]
- Passive R84 requires a high-gain, low-noise preamp -- Great River and API are mentioned as good pairings
- Works well in both close-mic and moderate-distance positions
- Consider the room -- as a figure-8 mic, the rear pickup will capture significant room ambience

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Coles 4038]] | Classic alternative; R84 considered "more versatile" by community |
| AEA R92 | Smaller sibling; excels on guitar/percussion but less suited for distance work |
| [[AEA R44]] | Big brother; more output, bigger sound, significantly higher price |
| [[Royer Ribbon Mics\|Royer R121]] | Popular alternative; some community members strongly prefer AEA |
| Beyerdynamic M160 | Hypercardioid ribbon; different pickup pattern, more midrange focused |
