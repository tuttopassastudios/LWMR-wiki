# Lewitt Microphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Lewitt is an Austrian microphone manufacturer that has rapidly gained credibility among professional engineers, particularly for their tube and hybrid microphones. The community consensus has shifted from initial skepticism to genuine enthusiasm -- "I remember kinda looking sideways at all the Lewitt hype on here but as I've seen more and more places using their stuff and then I used their flagship 1040, I gotta say I think those mics are on the rise." The LCT-840, [[Lewitt LCT 940|LCT 940]], and flagship LCT 1040 are the most discussed models, with engineers praising their tube/FET hybrid designs that provide remarkable versatility at price points well below comparable vintage gear.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large diaphragm condensers (tube, FET, and hybrid tube/FET designs)
- **Notable Models:** LCT-440, LCT-840, [[Lewitt LCT 940|LCT 940]], LCT 1040
- **Notable Features:** Variable tube/FET blending, variable polar patterns, magnetic pop shield, hypercardioid option on higher models

## Use Cases

Lewitt mics are used predominantly for vocal tracking across genres. Josh uses his LCT-840 "on everything and it's never sounded bad on anyone." The LCT 940 in full FET mode is described as sounding like a [[Sony C-800G]] with the 9kHz spike tamed by about a dB and a half. Engineers find the tube/FET blend particularly useful -- full FET for bright pop vocals, blended or full tube for warmer applications. The 940's hypercardioid pattern is specifically praised as sounding "even better" than cardioid. One engineer noted the 940 on full FET "sounds nice on female vocalists but too thin/hollow sounding on rap vox that needed to cut through."

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Tube swapping dramatically changes the character of Lewitt tube mics -- a vintage Telefunken ribbed plate ECC83 "completely changes the mic" by adding midrange focus
- The LCT 1040 represents their current flagship and is considered a step closer to "natural sounding" than the 940
- For sibilance-prone vocalists, the Lewitt is "rarely bad with sibilants"
- The magnetic pop shield is genuinely effective, not just a design gimmick
- Consider the LCT-840 as a budget entry point that still impresses at higher price comparisons

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Sony C-800G]] | The LCT 940 in FET mode sounds "legitimately identical" according to one member; saves thousands |
| [[Neumann U87]] | Lewitt offers more tonal flexibility via tube/FET blending |
| [[Microtech Gefell\|Gefell M930]] | Both frequently recommended as modern go-to mics; different tonal philosophies |
| Austrian Audio OC818 | Both are modern European designs; Austrian Audio is more C414-flavored |
| [[Neumann U47]] | Some community members controversially prefer Lewitts over 47s |

## Common Mistakes

- Dismissing Lewitt based on price point -- these mics genuinely compete with much more expensive options
- Not experimenting with tube swaps -- the stock Chinese 12AX7 is considered the weak link
- Using the 940 in full FET on all sources -- the tube/FET blend is where much of the versatility lies
