# Microtech Gefell

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Microtech Gefell is the East German descendant of the original Neumann company, split when Germany was divided after WWII. As one member explained, "Gefell is the East German half, Neumann is the West German half." The community holds Gefell in exceptionally high regard as a go-to recommendation for versatile, high-quality microphones that compete with or exceed modern Neumann offerings. The M930 and UMT70S are the most frequently discussed models, consistently recommended as "go anywhere, do anything" microphones that beat the U87ai while costing significantly less.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Large and small diaphragm condensers (FET and tube variants)
- **Notable Models:** M930, UMT70S, UM70, UM92.1, M71S, MT71S, M903
- **Notable Features:** Historical connection to original Neumann designs, no "boxy" quality found in modern U87ai, transparent high-end without harshness

## Use Cases

The M930 is the community's most recommended Gefell, praised for vocals, acoustic guitar, piano, and general studio duties. One engineer stated it is "better than the U87AI (less boxy) and not as harsh as the TLM103." The UMT70S is equally beloved, particularly for vocals where it competes directly with mics costing several times more. The UM70 is specifically praised for vocals -- "I adore the Gefell UM70, but I've only used the old transformer ones. Especially on vocals." The M71S is noted as getting close to vintage U87 territory "for half your budget." Engineers also use Gefell mics for travel setups, with one member pairing an M930 with a Symphony Desktop as a compact professional rig. The MT71S long-body design even allows handheld vocal recording.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The M930 is available in both standard and "TS" (transformer-less) versions -- be sure to specify which variant when discussing
- Pairs well with quality preamps; one engineer runs it with a Shelford Channel for tracking
- For acoustic guitar and piano, a matched pair of M930s delivers excellent results
- The M930 can be found B-stock for significant savings (one UK member reported getting one for 1,050 GBP vs 1,200 GBP retail)
- The UMT70S is the recommended choice when versatility and multi-pattern capability are priorities

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Neumann U87]] | Gefell consistently preferred over modern U87ai by the community; "beats out the modern 87 by a huge margin" |
| [[Neumann TLM 103]] | Gefell is smoother in the high end; TLM103 can be harsh |
| Austrian Audio OC818 | Both are frequently recommended modern alternatives; OC818 is more C414-flavored |
| [[Lewitt Microphones\|Lewitt LCT-840]] | Another modern recommendation; different tonal character |
| [[Soyuz Microphones\|Soyuz]] | Both praised as modern mics that stand on their own; Soyuz tends darker |
