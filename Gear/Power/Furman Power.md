# Furman Power

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Furman is the most commonly referenced power conditioner/distribution brand in the community. Their product range spans from basic rackmount power strips (~$50) to serious industrial-grade power conditioning like the IT Reference 15i (~$2000). The community consensus is that you do not need to spend a fortune on power conditioning -- a basic Furman rackmount with a front switch and outlet gets the job done. Higher-end models add surge protection, voltage regulation, and noise filtering for studios with problematic power.

## Key Characteristics

- Wide product range from basic rack power strips to industrial conditioning
- Basic rackmount Furmans: essentially power strips in rack format with switches
- Furman D10-PFP: power distributor without switches, good for daisy-chaining
- Furman Power Factor Pro: aggregates multiple rack Furmans, provides clean power
- Furman IT Reference 15i: high-end industrial surge protection and noise filtering
- Front panel switch and outlets are the most useful features on the basic models

## Use Cases

- Rackmount power distribution for studio gear
- Sequencing studio power-on/off with switched outlets
- Surge protection for sensitive gear
- Noise filtering in studios with EMI or dirty power issues
- Live performance power conditioning

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Buy one with a front switch and an outlet or two on the front face
- Daisy-chain multiple Furman D10s for large studios
- Use a Power Factor Pro or similar to aggregate multiple rack units
- For serious surge protection (thunderstorm-prone areas), pair with an APC UPS

## Comparable Alternatives

| Product | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pyle PC0850 | ~$30 | Basic rack power strip, no-frills |
| APC UPS | ~$150-500 | Battery backup, different purpose |
| [[Power Conditioner]] (generic) | Varies | See dedicated page |
| Furman IT Reference 15i | ~$2000 | Industrial-grade protection |

## Common Mistakes

- Spending too much on power conditioning when a basic Furman does the job
- Confusing basic Furman rack strips (glorified power strips) with actual power conditioning
- Not considering a UPS (APC) for battery backup in addition to a Furman
- Assuming a Furman will protect against a direct lightning strike -- unplug during serious storms

> "Most of the rack mount Furmans are just basic power strips in rack format... I went with a massive Furman IT Reference 15i between the wall and all our control room gear. It's expensive and heavy but I think it will prevent catastrophic power surges well and filters noise well too."
