# Amphion

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Amphion is a Finnish monitor manufacturer known for sealed-cabinet designs with passive radiators and a focus on accurate midrange reproduction. With 31 mentions in #monitoring-talk, Amphion monitors are discussed as an alternative to the community's "usual suspects" (PMC, ATC, Neumann). Their sealed design philosophy appeals to engineers who prioritize transient accuracy and controlled bass over extended low-end output.

## Key Characteristics

- Sealed cabinet design with passive radiators
- Known for accurate, controlled midrange
- Finnish-made, similar heritage to Genelec but different design philosophy
- Less bass extension than ported designs — pairs well with subwoofers
- Smooth, neutral voicing that avoids the brightness of some competitors

## Use Cases

- Mixing in smaller rooms where controlled bass is an advantage
- Engineers who prefer sealed-cabinet transient accuracy
- Pairing with subwoofers for full-range monitoring

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[ATC Monitors]] | Also sealed cabinet; more midrange-forward character |
| [[PMC Monitors]] | Transmission line design; more extended bass |
| [[Neumann KH310]] | 3-way active; more community discussion |
| [[Genelec Monitors]] | Fellow Finnish brand; ported design with room correction |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting deep bass extension without a subwoofer — sealed designs trade extension for accuracy
- Not auditioning before purchasing — Amphion's character is distinct from more commonly recommended monitors
