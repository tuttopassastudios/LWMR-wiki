# Neumann KH120

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neumann KH120 is a compact 2-way active monitor popular for smaller rooms, home studios, and as part of immersive audio setups. Bryan DiMaio used them as a step up from Yamaha HS80Ms and continues to use them for Atmos monitoring alongside KH80DSPs. They are well-suited for rooms where larger monitors would overexcite the space.

## Key Characteristics

- Compact 2-way active design with 5.25" woofer
- Well-suited for small rooms where larger monitors cause acoustic problems
- Common in Atmos and immersive audio setups (multiple speakers needed)
- Clean, detailed sound in the Neumann house style
- Step up from budget monitors like Yamaha HS series

## Use Cases

- Small room monitoring
- Home studio primary monitors
- Atmos/immersive audio surround and height channels — Bryan DiMaio uses KH120s alongside KH80DSPs in his Atmos monitoring setup
- Secondary nearfield monitors in larger studios

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Neumann KH310]] | Larger 3-way sibling; more midrange detail |
| [[Yamaha HS Monitors]] | Budget alternative; common upgrade path |
| Neumann KH150 | Newer model in between KH120 and KH310 |
| Neumann KH80 DSP | Smaller sibling for Atmos surrounds |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting full-range response from a compact monitor — consider adding a sub
- Over-exciting a small room with too-large monitors when KH120s would be more appropriate

> Context: KH120s appear frequently in community Atmos setups as ear-level monitors, paired with KH80DSPs or smaller Neumann models for height channels. Gerhard Westphalen emphasized the importance of matching crossover designs across speaker planes in immersive systems — using the same manufacturer/series helps avoid phase issues during spatial panning.
