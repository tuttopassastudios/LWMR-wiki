# Yamaha NS-10

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Yamaha NS-10 is arguably the most legendary studio monitor in recording history. Discontinued but still widely used, it is a passive 2-way speaker known for its intense, midrange-forward presentation with virtually no low end. Engineers who grew up on NS-10s often find the transition to modern hi-fi monitors jarring. The NS-10 excels at revealing vocal balance and midrange problems, making it a trusted reference despite its limitations.

## Key Characteristics

- Passive 2-way design requiring an external amplifier
- Paper cone drivers with punchy transient response
- Sealed (non-ported) cabinet for tight, accurate phase relationships
- Extremely midrange-forward with essentially no low end
- No longer manufactured — used market only
- CLA-10 is a modern tribute/clone

## Use Cases

- Reference monitoring for vocal and midrange balance
- Mixing at very low volumes — the CLA mixing-quiet technique works specifically on NS-10s
- Secondary reference alongside full-range monitors
- Checking mix translation on limited-bandwidth systems

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Best used as a secondary reference rather than primary mixing monitors
- Tissue paper over the tweeter is a classic trick to tame brightness
- Pair with full-range monitors and/or a subwoofer for complete picture

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Auratone]] | Single-driver mono reference; even more band-limited |
| [[Avantone MixCube]] | Modern Auratone-style reference |
| [[Yamaha HS Monitors]] | Spiritual successor, but different character |

## Common Mistakes

- Using NS-10s as your only monitors without understanding their severe frequency limitations
- Expecting the CLA ultra-quiet mixing approach to work on other speakers — it is NS-10 specific
- Selling NS-10s to replace with Auratones — "I'd stay on the NS10s"

> "I used to use similar justifications for working on NS10s for over a decade. 'If I can make it sound good on these, they'll sound good on anything!' Total bullshit. I probably collapsed half my midrange hearing with those fucking things. Ended up getting grown up speakers a few years ago -- haven't looked back since."

> Context: NS-10s appear frequently in studio setup photos, often as secondary reference monitors alongside larger mains. LAPhill's comment — "Arguing about NS-10s on the internet is an objectively bad use of time at the beach" (14 reactions) — captures the community's self-aware humor around the endless NS-10 debate. The tiny desk movement has reduced NS-10 usage as members move to smaller setups where NS-10s' physical footprint and harsh midrange are less practical.
