# Focal Monitors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Focal is a French manufacturer known for designing their own proprietary drivers, including their signature inverted dome tweeters. Community opinion is mixed: some appreciate the bright, detailed sound, while others note a midrange scoop and a brightness that measurements do not fully explain. The Alpha series is surprisingly well-liked for its price, while the Shape series received a lukewarm reception.

## Key Characteristics

- Custom-designed proprietary drivers including inverted dome tweeters
- Generally bright voicing with a slight upper midrange dip (scooped midrange)
- The Alpha 65 received positive marks — "actually quite liked these"
- The Shape 65 was described as "not as good as the Alphas"
- The Solo 6 Be and Trio6 are well-known professional models
- Brightness shows up subjectively but not always in measurements

## Use Cases

- Engineers who prefer brighter monitoring
- Studios wanting detailed high-end information
- Upgrading from budget monitors (Alpha series)

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[PMC Monitors]] | Also bright but different character |
| [[ATC Monitors]] | More midrange-focused alternative |
| [[Dynaudio Monitors]] | Different high-end character |
| Kali Audio | Budget alternative; David Fuller recommends over Focal at $1k |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming more expensive Focal models are always better — the Alpha 65 outperformed the Shape 65 for one user
- Not compensating for the characteristic brightness in mix decisions
