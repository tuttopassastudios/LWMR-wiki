# Yamaha HS Monitors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Yamaha HS series (HS5, HS7, HS8, and the earlier HS80M) are budget-friendly active monitors that serve as a common starting point for home studios and bedroom producers. Multiple community members used HS80Ms before upgrading to higher-end monitoring. While not in the same league as PMC, ATC, or Neumann, they are honest and reliable workhorse monitors for learning and developing one's ears.

## Key Characteristics

- Active 2-way monitors in various sizes (5", 7", 8" woofer)
- White cone woofer — visual callback to the [[Yamaha NS-10]]
- Affordable entry-level professional monitors
- Honest, relatively flat response for the price
- Common stepping stone to higher-end monitors

## Use Cases

- Home studio mixing and production
- Budget monitoring for writing and demo production
- Secondary reference monitors in larger studios
- Learning and ear training

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| KRK Rokit | Competing budget tier; more hyped low end |
| JBL LSR series | Another budget option; praised by community |
| Kali Audio | "Really doing great work" in the budget category |
| [[Yamaha NS-10]] | The legendary passive ancestor |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting HS monitors to compete with monitors costing 5-10x more
- Not investing in room treatment, which matters more than the monitors at this price point
