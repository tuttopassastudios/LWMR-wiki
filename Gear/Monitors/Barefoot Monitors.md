# Barefoot Monitors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Barefoot Sound monitors are high-end studio monitors known for their unique quality of sounding "flat and hyped at the same time." They have a strong following among top engineers, though the company's studio (Barefoot Recording) has closed. Some engineers find them polarizing — cian riordan tried multiple times to make them work but ultimately moved to ATCs. They feature very low distortion and significant low-end output for their size.

## Key Characteristics

- Described as "flat and hyped at the same time" — a unique sonic quality
- Very low distortion, which may explain the "hyped" perception despite flat response
- Significant low-end output relative to cabinet size
- Off-the-shelf drivers with sophisticated crossover design
- Barefoot Recording studio (the company's namesake studio) has closed

## Use Cases

- Professional mixing and mastering
- Studios requiring full-range monitoring without a subwoofer
- Tracking control room monitoring

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[ATC Monitors]] | More midrange-focused; popular alternative |
| [[PMC Monitors]] | Different voicing; also highly recommended |
| [[Neumann KH310]] | More affordable 3-way option |
| [[Focal Monitors]] | Custom drivers; scooped midrange |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming they will work for everyone — they are polarizing and not universally loved
- Not auditioning before purchasing at this price point
