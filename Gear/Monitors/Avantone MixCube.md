# Avantone MixCube

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Avantone MixCube is a small, single-driver reference monitor designed as a modern equivalent to the classic Auratone. It provides a band-limited listening experience focused on midrange clarity, useful for checking vocal balance and mono compatibility. Community opinion suggests the MixCube is more low-mid focused than the original Auratone, and some members found it "useless" while others appreciate its purpose.

## Key Characteristics

- Single full-range driver in a sealed cabinet
- Designed to emulate the Auratone concept
- More low-mid focused than original Auratones
- Available in active and passive versions
- Very limited bandwidth — intentionally so

## Use Cases

- Checking vocal and midrange balance
- Mono compatibility reference
- Simulating consumer playback systems (phones, laptops, TV)
- Secondary reference alongside full-range monitors

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Auratone]] | The original; preferred by some for its cleaner midrange |
| [[Yamaha NS-10]] | More capable but similar "honest midrange" philosophy |

## Common Mistakes

- Using as a primary monitor — it is strictly a reference/check tool
- Expecting it to replace NS-10s — they serve overlapping but different roles
