# PMC Monitors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> PMC (Professional Monitor Company) monitors are among the most recommended speakers in the community, alongside ATC and Neumann KH310. The twotwo.8 and Result 6/6-2 models are frequently cited. PMC monitors are praised for their clarity and translation, though some find the high end "glassy." The Unfuck Your Room studio design team has strong ties to PMC, which influences some recommendations. Multiple members describe PMC as a speaker where "you hear the song" rather than the speakers.

## Key Characteristics

- Transmission line bass loading design (a PMC signature)
- Models discussed: twotwo.6, twotwo.8, Result 6, 6-2 (active digital)
- Generally considered bright — David Fuller notes "goofily bright" treble in measurements
- Some describe the high end as "glassy"
- Excellent translation — mixes done on PMCs tend to translate well
- The 6-2 accepts digital input via AES

## Use Cases

- Primary mixing monitors
- Tracking control room speakers
- Production and songwriting
- Pair well with subwoofers for extended low end

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Treatment + speakers together yields the biggest improvement — "the double punch of treatment + speakers has really brought things up a notch"
- The twotwo.8 can be acquired as demo pairs from Sweetwater with financing

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[ATC Monitors]] | More midrange-focused; some prefer for detailed mixing |
| [[Barefoot Monitors]] | "Flat and hyped at the same time" |
| [[Neumann KH310]] | Highly regarded 3-way alternative |
| [[Focal Monitors]] | Bright but with a midrange scoop |
| [[Dynaudio Monitors]] | "Spitty and brittle" high end per one user |

## Common Mistakes

- Not treating the room — monitors alone do not solve mix translation issues
- Buying on reputation alone without auditioning — monitor choice is deeply personal
- Not recognizing that the Unfuck team has PMC ties, which may influence recommendations

> "If you haven't ever had a solid mixing environment where you rely on midrange don't go ATC, they seem to be for people who have spent a decade on similar speakers. If you are stepping into your first real pair go PMC, I can HEAR atc mixes, pmc mixes I hear the SONG." — kidcutler
