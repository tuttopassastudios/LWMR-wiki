# Dynaudio Monitors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Dynaudio is a Danish speaker manufacturer known for designing their own proprietary drivers. The Core 7 series has been praised as "really good for the price and size." However, some community members describe Dynaudio's high end as "spitty and brittle." They approach speaker design by building custom drivers and keeping crossovers simple, alongside companies like Focal, ATC, and JBL.

## Key Characteristics

- Custom-designed proprietary drivers
- The Core series represents their professional studio line
- The Core 7 is well-regarded for the price
- High end described as potentially "spitty and brittle" by some
- Design philosophy: build custom drivers, keep crossovers simple

## Use Cases

- Professional studio mixing
- Smaller rooms where the Core 7 size is appropriate
- Alternative to PMC or ATC for engineers who prefer the Dynaudio voicing

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[PMC Monitors]] | Different voicing; very popular in community |
| [[Neumann KH310]] | Similar price bracket for 3-way monitoring |
| [[ATC Monitors]] | Custom driver approach; more midrange detail |
| [[Focal Monitors]] | Similar custom-driver philosophy |

## Common Mistakes

- Not auditioning against competitors — the high-end character is polarizing
