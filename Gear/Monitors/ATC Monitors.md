# ATC Monitors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> ATC (Acoustic Transducer Company) monitors are widely regarded as some of the finest reference monitors available for professional mixing and mastering. Built in the UK with custom-designed and manufactured drivers -- including their signature soft-dome midrange driver -- ATCs are known for exceptional midrange clarity, sealed-cabinet accuracy, and an uncolored response that reveals the truth of a mix. They are a common sight in world-class studios and mastering houses, and within the LWMR community they are frequently recommended as an endgame monitor purchase.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Active (powered) and passive studio reference monitors
- **Topology:** Sealed (acoustic suspension) cabinet design with custom drivers. Three-way models feature ATC's proprietary 75mm soft-dome midrange driver, which provides extraordinary detail in the critical midrange frequencies. The sealed enclosure trades some low-frequency extension for tighter, more accurate bass response.
- **Notable Features:** Custom in-house drivers, hand-built construction, extremely low distortion in the midrange, linear phase response. The SCM25a is the most commonly discussed model in the community, with the SCM50 considered the aspirational choice. Active models include built-in amplification matched to the drivers.

## Use Cases

ATCs are chosen by engineers who prioritize accuracy and translation above all else. They excel in mixing environments where midrange decisions are critical -- vocal balancing, guitar tone, and overall tonal balance. NoahNeedleman reported that the SCM25As "have saved me time" that has "already paid for them at least 1 and a half times." They are particularly valued by full-time mix engineers who need mixes to translate reliably across playback systems. Jodonny noted ATCs have "more energy" than PMCs, making them better for songwriting sessions where the artist needs to feel inspired. David Fuller stated plainly: "Having listened to all 3 [ATCs, PMCs, Focals], the ATCs to me by far make the most sense."

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- **Room treatment is essential.** ATCs are revealing enough that room problems become immediately apparent. Multiple community members stress the importance of proper acoustic treatment before investing in high-end monitors.
- **Sub pairing is strongly recommended.** peterlabberton noted that "everything in the ATC lineup is gonna want a sub" as they "aren't designed to really push a ton of lows in the way most of us want to hear and feel it." David Fuller confirmed that "basically every ATC lacks bottom end for its size class."
- **SCM25a + dual subs** is a popular configuration. cian riordan runs his with two 15-inch subs.
- **Placement and amplification matter.** The sealed cabinet design is less sensitive to rear-wall proximity than ported designs, but proper positioning is still critical for imaging.
- **Break-in period.** ATCs are known to improve over the first several hundred hours of use as the drivers loosen up.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[PMC TwoTwo.8]] | Transmission-line design with more extended low end; some find them "sterile" for creative sessions, but excellent for mixing. peterlabberton considers them comparable value |
| [[Neumann KH310]] | David Fuller says they do "the 25 thing, but with way more bottom end and at half the price" -- possibly the best value in the class |
| [[Focal Trio6]] | Brighter voicing; David Fuller considers ATCs "better than the Focal Trio6s" |
| [[Barefoot Sound]] | "Flat and hyped at the same time" per Josh and David Fuller; very low distortion with more bass extension |
| [[Dynaudio Core 7]] | Maxim found them surprisingly good for the price and size |
| ATC SCM20 + subs | BatMeckley's route; many claim this gets you "closer to the 50s than the 25s will" |
| ATC SCM45a | Controversial -- cian riordan found "something about the speaker layout" always sounded "wonky"; BatMeckley reports no one he trusts recommends them, suggesting the 25s or jumping to 50s instead |
| ATC SCM50 | The aspirational choice; significantly more expensive but considered the gold standard |

## Common Mistakes

- **Buying ATCs without proper room treatment.** The monitors will expose every room problem ruthlessly. Invest in the room first.
- **Skipping the sub.** The SCM25a rolls off around 45 Hz. For modern music (especially pop and hip-hop), a subwoofer is essentially required.
- **Choosing the SCM45a as a compromise.** Community consensus strongly favors the 25s or jumping to the 50s. The 45s have an unusual driver layout that multiple experienced engineers find problematic.
- **Buying without demoing.** As Slow Hand emphasized, "simply sitting down with a monitor controller and being able to A/B/C a few sets will tell you a ton." NoahNeedleman was looking at Focals until he heard the ATCs at Vintage King and realized "not only was the price difference worth it, it was a no brainer."
- **Expecting ATCs to be the right choice for everyone.** kidcutler cautioned: "If you haven't ever had a solid mixing environment where you rely on midrange don't go ATC, they seem to be for people who have spent a decade on similar speakers."
