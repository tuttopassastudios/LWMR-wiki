# Auratone

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Auratone (originally the 5C "Sound Cube") is a classic single-driver passive reference monitor used since the 1970s for checking how mixes translate on limited playback systems. With frequency response rolling off steeply above 2-8 kHz, it strips away everything but the midrange core of a mix. The community considers it inferior to the NS-10 as a primary mixing tool but useful as a mono midrange reference.

## Key Characteristics

- Single full-range driver in a very small sealed cabinet
- Extremely band-limited — frequency response drops sharply, perhaps as low as 2 kHz
- Paper driver with punchy transients and no ported design
- Passive — requires an external amplifier
- Best used as a mono reference, not a stereo pair

## Use Cases

- Mono midrange reference checking
- Vocal balance verification
- Simulating the worst-case playback scenario
- Complement to full-range monitors

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Avantone MixCube]] | Modern alternative; more low-mid focused |
| [[Yamaha NS-10]] | More capable; serves as both reference and mixing tool |

## Common Mistakes

- Selling NS-10s to replace with Auratones — the NS-10 is substantially more capable
- Expecting to mix on Auratones as a primary monitor
