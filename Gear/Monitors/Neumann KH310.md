# Neumann KH310

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neumann KH310 is a 3-way active monitor that has earned a strong reputation in the community as one of the "usual suspects" alongside PMC and ATC. It offers excellent clarity but may benefit from a subwoofer for extended low end, particularly at lower monitoring levels. David Fuller ended his long monitor journey on KH310s, and they are recommended as a step up from budget monitors.

## Key Characteristics

- 3-way active design with dedicated midrange driver
- Excellent clarity and detail
- May lack low-end "thump" at lower listening levels (70-75 dB) without a sub
- Well-suited for smaller to medium rooms
- Solid build quality and reliability

## Use Cases

- Primary mixing monitors
- Nearfield monitoring in professional studios
- Pair with KH subwoofer for full-range monitoring

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Adding a sub crossed at around 80 Hz extends usefulness significantly
- Works well at moderate monitoring levels (78-80 dB+)

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[PMC Monitors]] | Community favorite; different voicing |
| [[ATC Monitors]] | More midrange-focused |
| [[Barefoot Monitors]] | Higher price point; polarizing |
| [[Dynaudio Monitors]] Core 7 | "Really good for the price & size" |

## Common Mistakes

- Not adding a subwoofer — the low end can feel lacking at normal listening levels
- Comparing unfairly to full-range soffit-mounted systems

> [!quote] sneaky_circuits — KH310 emotional experience (#monitoring-talk, December 2021, 3 reactions)
> "After 2 weeks with the KH310 demos, I'm A/B testing against the ol' JBL LSR308s as a sanity check [...] I feel like the KH310 have taught me how to listen better and what to look for in music, like, I can hear the same elements on the JBLs if I TRY now but on the KH310 I notice things right away without trying. [...] I think what's causing the intense feelings is the space they reveal. Things aren't clashing in the high end. [...] I also still feel like producing on flat speakers is a vibe. So glad I tried it."
