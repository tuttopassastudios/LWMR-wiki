# Genelec Monitors

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Genelec is a Finnish monitor manufacturer with a long history in professional studios. While ubiquitous in studios worldwide, community opinion is mixed. Multiple members report difficulty mixing on Genelecs, citing low-mid "gunk" and soft high end on older models like the 1031. Newer models like the 8341 (coaxial/SAM series) are better regarded. Genelec's room correction (GLM/SAM) software adds significant value.

## Key Characteristics

- Finnish-made active monitors with long professional heritage
- Older models (1031, 8030) have mixed reception — "low mid gunk and too soft high end"
- Newer SAM (Smart Active Monitoring) series with room correction capabilities
- The 8341 coaxial design is well-regarded
- Extremely common in studios worldwide, especially in Europe
- Build quality is excellent

## Use Cases

- Studio monitoring (especially newer SAM models)
- Immersive/Atmos monitoring — popular across all tiers, from 8010/8020 for height channels to 8341/8351 "The Ones" for mains in 7.1.4 setups. Consistent voicing across models makes them well-suited for matching across speaker planes in immersive systems.
- Studios that benefit from built-in room correction

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[PMC Monitors]] | Community favorite; better translation per some |
| [[Neumann KH310]] | Highly recommended 3-way alternative |
| [[ATC Monitors]] | Preferred by midrange-focused engineers |
| Kali Audio | Budget alternative with similar coaxial approach |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming brand recognition equals best choice — "I've never had good luck mixing on genelecs"
- Not using the GLM/SAM room correction on models that support it
- Generalizing across the entire line — newer models are substantially different from older ones

> Context: Genelec 8020s appear in Eric Martin's mobile checked-bag studio (Mac Studio + Apollo x4 + Genelec 8020s in a Pelican Air 1615). Genelec's wood-finish models generate aesthetic discussion alongside acoustic performance. The community values Genelecs for small-room and portable setups where SAM room correction compensates for compromised placement.

> Context: Genelec monitors are a popular choice for Atmos monitoring setups in the community. Their consistent voicing across models (from small 8010/8020 height speakers to larger 8341/8351 mains) makes them well-suited for immersive systems where matching across speaker planes is important.
