# Patchbays

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> A patchbay is the central routing hub of a hardware-based recording studio, allowing all audio connections to be accessible from a single location. Rather than crawling behind racks to swap cables, engineers can reroute signal flow by patching short cables on the front panel. As cian riordan put it, "The patchbay is the real nucleus of any working recording studio and can really enhance and accommodate any workflows you already have set in motion." While not the most glamorous studio purchase, a well-planned patchbay transforms studio workflow and is considered essential infrastructure by working professionals.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Audio signal routing panel
- **Topology:** Available in TT (Tiny Telephone / bantam) and 1/4" TRS formats. TT patchbays offer higher density (more points per rack unit) and are the professional standard in larger studios. 1/4" TRS bays are more affordable and use commonly available cables. Rear connections are available as solder tabs, 1/4" jacks, or DB25 connectors, with DB25 being the strongly preferred modern choice.
- **Notable Features:** Normalling configurations (full normal, half normal, open/de-normalled) determine default signal routing. In a half-normalled connection, the signal flows through by default but inserting a patch cable on the output row taps the signal without breaking the normal -- the most versatile and commonly recommended configuration.

## Use Cases

A patchbay becomes essential once a studio has more than a handful of outboard pieces. It centralizes all I/O -- converter inputs/outputs, preamp sends/returns, compressor inserts, tie lines to the live room -- into an organized, accessible panel. The ideal setup, as cian riordan described, is "one that you're not actually patching things in and out of... normalling is everything." A well-planned normalling scheme means your default signal flow works without any patch cables inserted, and patches are only needed for exceptions. David Fuller uses full normals only for mic preamp inputs "so I'm not sending phantom somewhere it shouldn't go," with half-normals for everything else. Eric Martin's approach: "I'd half-norm all my stuff so that I don't need to use any plugs to work a normal day, then when I want to make changes, patch in that change for that moment."

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- **Go DB25 on the rear.** Rollmottle speaks from experience: "Having gone down the patchbay route a number of times, going DB25 for the rear connection makes your life soooooo much easier than a solder or a jack bay."
- **Consider TT even for small setups.** Rollmottle advises: "Even a simple setup can eat a bunch of I/O and you'll have room to expand without eating up more rack space."
- **Full normal mic inputs, half-normal everything else.** This prevents accidental phantom power routing while maintaining maximum flexibility for line-level signals.
- **Plan normalling before purchasing.** Map out your default signal flow on paper first. Decide which connections should be normalled (always connected by default) and which should float (available for patching but not connected by default).
- **Consult a professional.** hyanrarvey strongly recommends Trace Audio's Ben for consulting: "I can't recommend him enough, he's wired up a lot of well-known studios and is a genius when it comes to patch bays."

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| Switchcraft 9625 | Professional-grade TT patchbay with DB25 rear. BatMeckley, Rollmottle, and David Fuller all endorse it. "Spendy upfront but absolutely bulletproof" |
| Redco DB-25 TT Patchbay | Recommended by Zack Hames as "a good place to start." Solid quality with DB25 rear at a more accessible price point |
| Samson S-Patch | Budget-friendly 1/4" TRS option. Can flip half/full normal from the front panel. Zack Hames found them solid with no issues, though Eric Martin experienced grounding noise in his older building |
| Solder-tab bays | The old-school approach. David Fuller and cian riordan agree: solder tab bays are "the biggest pain in the ass possible" and it's "insane that anyone would suffer that in this day and age" |
| Direct wiring (no patchbay) | Simplest approach but inflexible. Eric Martin notes the patchbay "isn't a sexy thing to spend over a grand on" but the workflow improvement is worth it |

## Common Mistakes

- **Underestimating cabling costs.** BatMeckley warns: "When getting a patchbay, make sure you factor in the price of the cabling. That particular expense will sneak up on you." David Fuller agrees: "Things nobody tells you about outboard: cabling is $$$$$$$." Eric Martin delayed his patchbay purchase entirely because of cabling costs.
- **Choosing solder-tab bays for a new install.** DB25 rear connections are vastly easier to work with and reconfigure. Multiple experienced engineers call solder bays obsolete for new installations.
- **Not planning the normalling scheme.** Rushing into a patchbay without mapping your signal flow first leads to rewiring later. chrissorem admitted to rewiring his bay four times over the years.
- **Running mic-level signals through a half-normalled bay carelessly.** Phantom power can end up where it should not go. Use full normals for mic inputs or keep mic connections off the patchbay entirely.
- **Using 1/4" TRS in environments with grounding issues.** Eric Martin experienced noise problems with TRS bays in an older building with questionable electrical grounding. TT bays can be more forgiving in these situations.
- **Skipping XLR on the equipment end.** Rollmottle learned the hard way: "Definitely go XLR on the other end of whatever you end up going with on the bay side. Made the mistake of going 1/4" on a solder bay... bad time."
