# GIK Acoustics

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> GIK Acoustics is the most commonly recommended pre-made acoustic treatment manufacturer in the community. Based in Georgia (with European distribution), they offer panels, bass traps, and diffusers at prices that sit between DIY and high-end custom solutions. Multiple members use GIK panels in professional studios, including mastering rooms. They also offer custom metal stands for freestanding panel installation when wall mounting is not an option.

## Key Characteristics

- Pre-made acoustic panels, bass traps, and diffusers
- More affordable than custom acoustic consultants but more expensive than DIY
- Custom metal stands available for freestanding installation (no wall drilling required)
- Long lead times on orders
- European distribution available
- GIK also offers a portable vocal booth product
- Used in professional studios including PMC's Brooklyn demo studio

## Use Cases

- First reflection treatment in mixing rooms
- Bass trapping in corners
- Freestanding treatment for rental spaces where drilling is not allowed
- Ceiling clouds (panels can be strapped together with lumber)
- Portable vocal treatment

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- GIK's custom metal stands lift panels 1 foot off the ground with a 5" air gap off the wall
- Corner bass traps should be as thick as possible
- Start with first reflections and corners, then add ceiling treatment

## Comparable Alternatives

| Treatment | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DIY [[Rockwool]] Panels | ~$30-50/panel | Much cheaper, requires labor |
| John Hunter Acoustics (LA) | Custom pricing | LA-based, custom design and measurement |
| Auralex | ~$100-300 | Foam-based, less effective at low frequencies |
| Custom Studio Build | $$$$ | Professional acoustician, best results |

## Common Mistakes

- Not ordering early enough -- GIK has long wait times
- Skipping bass trapping in favor of only flat panels on walls
- Not considering DIY panels if budget is tight -- [[Rockwool]] panels are significantly cheaper
- Forgetting that freestanding options exist when you cannot drill into walls
