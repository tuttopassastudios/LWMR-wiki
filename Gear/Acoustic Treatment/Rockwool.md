# Rockwool

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Rockwool (formerly Roxul) Safe 'n' Sound and similar mineral wool insulation products are the go-to DIY acoustic treatment material recommended in the community. Dense, absorptive, and affordable, Rockwool is used to build acoustic panels, bass traps, and ceiling clouds. It is functionally equivalent to Owens Corning 703 for acoustic purposes. In Europe, Basotect (a synthetic material) offers similar acoustic properties. Rockwool has become something of a running joke in the community as the answer to many studio problems.

## Key Characteristics

- Dense mineral wool insulation with excellent broadband absorption
- Available at hardware stores (Home Depot, Lowes in the US)
- Used in DIY acoustic panels, bass traps, and ceiling clouds
- Must be covered with breathable fabric that does not reflect sound
- 4" thickness is a common starting point; thicker is better for low-frequency absorption
- Air gap behind panels adds effective depth without additional material
- European alternative: Basotect (synthetic, similar properties)

## Use Cases

- DIY acoustic panel construction for first reflections
- Bass trap construction for corners
- Ceiling clouds to address overhead reflections
- Portable panels for traveling recording rigs

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- 4" panels for first reflections as a minimum; 6" or deeper for better low-frequency control
- Air gap between panel and wall effectively adds to the panel depth
- 10cm thickness may be sufficient for first reflections with adequate air gap behind
- Cover with breathable fabric (burlap, muslin) -- do not use reflective material

## Comparable Alternatives

| Material | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Owens Corning 703 | ~$80-120/box | Fiberglass, equivalent performance |
| Owens Corning R30 | ~$50/batt | Ceiling insulation, good for deadening |
| Basotect (Europe) | Varies | Synthetic, similar acoustic properties |
| Auralex Foam | ~$100-300 | Convenient but expensive and less effective |
| [[GIK Acoustics]] Panels | ~$60-200/panel | Pre-made, no DIY required |

## Common Mistakes

- Using thin foam instead of dense mineral wool -- foam does not absorb low frequencies effectively
- Covering panels with reflective fabric that negates the absorption
- Not treating the ceiling -- one of the most commonly forgotten reflection points
- Building panels that are too thin (2") when 4"+ is needed for broadband absorption
- Forgetting the air gap, which is free and adds effective depth
