# Acoustic Absorption

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Acoustic absorption is consistently cited as one of the highest-impact investments for any studio, often more important than upgrading gear. The community emphasizes treating first reflections, corners (bass traps), and ceilings. DIY panels using [[Rockwool]] or Owens Corning 703 are the most cost-effective approach, while [[GIK Acoustics]] is the go-to for pre-made solutions. Auralex foam is generally discouraged -- too expensive for what it does, and most professional studios use custom panels instead.

## Key Characteristics

- First reflections (side walls at the mix position) are the highest priority
- Bass traps in corners address low-frequency buildup
- Ceiling treatment (clouds) is frequently forgotten but critical
- Dense, thick absorptive material (4"+) needed for broadband absorption
- Foam is ineffective at low frequencies -- mineral wool or fiberglass is preferred
- Air gap behind panels adds effective absorption depth for free
- Breathable fabric coverings are essential -- reflective materials negate the absorption
- Blankets on mic stands can serve as improvised treatment for tracking

## Use Cases

- Mixing room treatment for accurate monitoring
- Tracking room control for clean recordings
- Portable treatment for traveling studios
- Deadening live rooms for dry vocal recording

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Treat first reflections first, then corners, then ceiling
- Use the mirror trick to find first reflection points
- 4" panels minimum; 6" or deeper in corners
- Air gap behind panels = free extra depth
- Do not over-treat -- a completely dead room is unpleasant and can hurt the music

## Comparable Alternatives

| Approach | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DIY [[Rockwool]] Panels | ~$30-50/panel | Best value, requires labor |
| [[GIK Acoustics]] | ~$60-200/panel | Pre-made, long lead time |
| Auralex Foam | ~$100-300 | Expensive, thin, poor LF absorption |
| Professional Acoustic Design | $$$$ | Best results, highest cost |
| Heavy Blankets | ~$20-50 | Improvised, portable, surprisingly effective |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying Auralex foam instead of dense mineral wool panels
- Treating only the walls and forgetting the ceiling
- Using reflective fabric that negates the panel's absorption
- Over-treating a room until it is uncomfortably dead
- Spending thousands on gear upgrades before addressing room acoustics
- Not considering the position of the singer relative to the mic's rejection pattern
