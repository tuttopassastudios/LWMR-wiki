# BAE Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> BAE Audio (originally Brent Averill Enterprises) is the most respected name in Neve-style reproductions. For years, BAE was the only manufacturer producing preamps that genuinely sounded like vintage Neves, and their units can be found in virtually every major studio. Their 1073 and 1084 models occupy a unique position -- not quite vintage originals, but far more than mere clones. The community considers them the benchmark against which all other [[Neve 1073]] reproductions are measured.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Transformer-coupled solid-state
- **Topology:** Class A, discrete transistor (following original Neve topology)
- **Notable Features:**
  - Faithful reproduction of original Neve 1073/1084 circuit topologies
  - Available in both 500-series and full 19" rack-mount formats
  - 3-band EQ section matching original Neve frequency selections
  - Switchable input impedance for mic matching
  - Quality DI input
  - Historically used actual Neve console components in BAE-branded chassis

## Historical Significance

BAE's origin story gives them unique credibility in the Neve clone market:

- **Bryan DiMaio:** "At one point BAE gear was just Neve console components in a BAE branded chassis." They also did the same for API preamps.
- **NoahNeedleman:** "BAE was making the only Neve sounding Neves for a lot of years. Their shit is in every major studio I've worked in, so calling it a ripoff seems a little off base."
- **David Fuller:** "BAE 1073 is the best one on the market outside of the vintage ones IMO."

## Use Cases

BAE preamps are the go-to recommendation for engineers seeking the Neve sound without vintage prices:

- **Vocals:** NoahNeedleman's main vocal chain uses the BAE 1073D: "Very happy with it." He gives a "hard recommend" for the BAE 1073s based on extensive use.
- **Hip hop, R&B, and pop:** Bryan DiMaio's "go to for those genres is usually 1073."
- **Acoustic guitar:** Multiple members recommend BAE for acoustic tracking alongside vocals.
- **First outboard preamp:** Will Trotman, looking for his first hardware pre, was pointed toward BAE 1073 by several members as a strong starting point.

## BAE vs. Vintage Neve

The community has strong and nuanced opinions here:

- **Cian riordan:** "I think we need to start the movement to make people realize that a BAE 1073 does not equal a Neve 1073." He compared it to how "I wouldn't call a U87ai a U87."
- **ehutton21:** "I was surprised how close my Vintech x73i sounded to the studio BAE 1073 without the EQs engaged on either, but the BAE eq is its own thing. Not sure it's better, just different." He also noted: "The biggest thing that really sets Neve manufacturers apart is how their EQs affect the tone of the amp and that circuitry."
- **hyanrarvey:** "BAE kicks the shit out of AMS" (the official modern Neve reissues).
- **Eric Martin** had a different take, finding AMS Neve DPX units "nearly indistinguishable" from vintage in his comparisons.

The takeaway: BAE preamps are excellent on their own merits. Whether they sound "like a real 1073" depends heavily on the specific comparison conditions, signal chain, and what you are listening for.

## BAE vs. Rupert Neve Designs

When choosing between BAE and RND (Rupert Neve Designs) units like the 5211:

- **Felix Byrne:** "The RND gives the *thing* in a more manageable/flexible way than the pure 1073s but that might not be the right thing anyway."
- **NoahNeedleman** gave a "hard recommend" for BAE over RND for the original question.
- **Bryan DiMaio:** "You won't really go wrong with either but my go to for those genres [R&B, hip hop, pop] is usually 1073."
- **Bryan DiMaio** on the BAE specifically: "It's not gonna distort like crazy unless you push it like crazy" and praised the impedance switching and DI as strong features.

## 500 Series vs. Full Rack

The community echoes the same pattern seen with other preamps:

- **Cian riordan** on the big rack BAE gear: "It's great because it's very close to the original topology of the circuits. There's just no way to accomplish this within the form and power limitations of a 500 series chassis."
- **NoahNeedleman** happily uses BAE 1073D (500 series) as his primary vocal chain -- proof that the 500-series versions are more than capable for professional work.
- **herbie** confirmed through shootouts that rack versions have "more weight/density compared to the 500 series version."

## The 1084 Variant

- **JoshuaEstock:** "I have a pair of BAE 1084s and they're great." He also recommends CAPI as an alternative if you are handy with a soldering iron, noting you can build multiple channels for the price of a single BAE unit.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- **Vocals:** The BAE 1073 excels at adding body and presence. Bryan DiMaio uses the EQ for light tracking adjustments.
- **Ribbon mics:** Brian Reynolds found that "a little bump at 4.8k brings a ton of more excitement while tracking vocals" with a ribbon through his 1073SPX, leading to better vocal takes.
- **Impedance switching:** Bryan DiMaio highlights "the ability to switch the impedance to better suit your mic for the sound you want" as an underappreciated feature.
- **DI:** Bryan DiMaio: "Also also the DI sounds sick."

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| Vintage [[Neve 1073]] | The gold standard; BAE is the closest modern reproduction |
| AMS Neve 1073 DPX/SPX | Official reissue; some prefer it, hyanrarvey says BAE wins |
| [[Rupert Neve Designs]] 5211 | More flexible/manageable; less "pure" 1073 character |
| Vintech x73i | Budget alternative; surprisingly close to BAE without EQ |
| Aurora Audio GTQC | Different Neve lineage; Doug McKean's favorite |
| [[Chandler Limited]] TG2 | Different character entirely; "weight of Neve, speed of API" |
| Heritage Audio 73-EQ | Another 1073 clone; narrower sweet spots |

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming BAE equals vintage Neve.** They are excellent preamps with their own character, but the EQ section in particular behaves differently from original Neve modules.
- **Worrying about "too much mojo."** Bryan DiMaio reassured one user: "If you need less mojo your interface pres already do that. But it's also not gonna distort like crazy unless you push it like crazy."
- **Skipping the EQ.** Many buyers plan to ignore the EQ section, but Brian Reynolds and Bryan DiMaio both found it valuable for light tracking decisions.
- **Not considering room treatment first.** Felix Byrne: "99% of the time the difference between a shite recording and a great one is not any analog preamp or boutique compressor, but a difference in recording environment and technique."
