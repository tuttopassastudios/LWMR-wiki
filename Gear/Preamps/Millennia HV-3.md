# Millennia HV-3

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Millennia HV-3 is a transparent, high-fidelity solid-state preamp often used in classical, acoustic, and folk recording where capturing the source accurately is paramount. Community opinion is mixed — some consider it the gold standard for transparency while others find it "highly overrated" with a problematic high-frequency coloration. It is frequently compared to GML and Grace preamps in the transparency category.

## Key Characteristics

- Solid-state design aimed at maximum transparency and minimal coloration
- The Origin model offers both solid-state and tube modes, though the tube mode is less favored
- Described as "the Schoeps of preamps" — sounds like what is in front of it
- Some engineers report an unpleasant high-end coloration that becomes hard to ignore once noticed
- High channel-count options available for orchestral and ensemble recording

## Use Cases

- Classical and acoustic music recording where transparency is critical
- Folk music and singer-songwriter sessions
- Pairing with already-colored microphones where a neutral preamp is desired
- Situations where the source needs to be captured as faithfully as possible

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Best used when transparency is the goal — not a preamp for adding color or character
- Pairs well with characterful microphones (ribbons, vintage condensers) that benefit from a neutral pre

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[GML 8200]] (preamp section) | Preferred by some over Millennia — "GML absolutely slay Millennia in that game" |
| Grace Design | Even more transparent; some engineers upgrade from Millennia to Grace |
| [[Focusrite ISA]] | Less transparent but more affordable and arguably more musical |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming "transparent" means "sounds good on everything" — the Millennia can sound clinical on sources that benefit from coloration
- Not auditioning against GML or Grace alternatives, which may better serve the same goals
- Using the tube mode on the Origin expecting it to compete with dedicated tube preamps
