# Neve 1073

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neve 1073 is arguably the most famous preamp circuit ever designed. Originally built for Neve recording consoles in the early 1970s, it is a transformer-coupled, Class A design that has become the gold standard for colored, musical amplification. Its influence is so widespread that nearly every major preamp manufacturer offers some variation of the 1073 topology, and the ongoing debate about originals vs. clones is one of the longest-running conversations in professional audio.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Transformer-coupled solid-state
- **Topology:** Class A, discrete transistor
- **Notable Features:**
  - Marinair input and output transformers (originals)
  - 3-band EQ section with fixed frequency selections (high shelf, mid bell, low shelf)
  - Stepped gain control with "kill switch" off position in the middle of the knob
  - High impedance mic input (~1200 ohms)
  - Legendary midrange density and harmonic richness

## Use Cases

Engineers reach for the 1073 primarily on **vocals**, where it has helped sell more records than perhaps any other preamp circuit. It is also a staple on **electric and acoustic guitars**, **bass DI**, and **drum overheads**. The 1073 adds weight, density, and a musical coloration that helps sources sit in a dense mix without excessive processing.

That said, not everyone finds it ideal for every application. As BatMeckley noted, his decision-making downstream (compression, saturation, EQ) is built around a specific sound, and the 1073 did not always fit that chain -- particularly on vocals. The community consensus is that it excels when you want harmonic richness and midrange presence baked into the recording.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- **EQ Section:** The 12kHz high shelf is widely praised. Eric Martin describes the "12k shelf top end" as "amazing." Bryan DiMaio uses the EQ for "light shaping" on vocals. Cian riordan considers the broad-band EQ "incredibly powerful and musical" for tone shaping, especially on a console like the 8028 where "there's no world where I would not be jacking the high shelf."
- **Gain Staging:** The sweet spots for gain on a given source are described as "quite small" -- you may find a frequency setting terrible at one gain position and great at another just one click away.
- **Kill Switch Gotcha:** The gain knob has an off position in the middle of its rotation. As Slow Hand warned, "I inevitably forget about it and end up troubleshooting for three minutes when it stops passing signal."
- **Tracking Tip:** Cian riordan recommends: "Boost high end on hardware going in, do your cuts in software."

## Original vs. Clones

This is one of the most debated topics in the LWMR community:

- **AMS Neve (modern reissues):** Eric Martin found the AMS Neve 1073 DPX/SPX "nearly indistinguishable" from vintage units in side-by-side comparisons with old U67s, U47s, and U87s. A studio owner he works with outfitted his rack with AMS units to match his vintage ones. However, ehutton21 noted that "AMS Neves are nice and pretty faithful, but the eq doesn't sound like a BAE 1073."
- **BAE Audio:** Cian riordan started "the movement to make people realize that a BAE 1073 does not equal a Neve 1073." ehutton21 was surprised how close his Vintech x73i sounded to a BAE without EQs engaged, but "the BAE eq is its own thing."
- **The 1% Compound Effect:** BatMeckley observed that while one-to-one comparisons may show slight differences, "if it's your main pre and you stack it across 50 tracks that difference really starts to compound."
- **Transformer Quality:** Nomograph Mastering provided technical insight -- "a very common weakness in modern/cheap/Chinese knock off transformers is that they don't have a high enough inductance. Under ideal conditions that doesn't matter much, but under stressful conditions it can matter a lot."

## 500 Series vs. Full-Size

The community is clear on this distinction:

- BatMeckley: "When you try to cram tech that was meant for a bigger rack into a 500 series slot, compromises have to be made. That doesn't mean they sound bad, just not the same as the big guys."
- Herbie confirmed through shootouts that "the rack version did feel like it had more weight/density compared to the 500 series version."
- Cian riordan: The big 10 series/19" BAE stuff is "great because it's very close to the original topology of the circuits. There's just no way to accomplish this within the form and power limitations of a 500 series chassis."
- However, NoahNeedleman uses a BAE 1073D (500 series) as his main vocal chain and is "very happy with it" -- proving that excellent results are achievable in the smaller format.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[BAE Audio]] 1073 | Most respected clone; faithful reproduction, different EQ character from vintage |
| [[AMS Neve]] 1073 DPX/SPX | Official reissue; very close to vintage in controlled comparisons |
| [[Vintech]] x73i | Budget-friendly; surprisingly close to BAE without EQ engaged |
| [[Heritage Audio]] 73-EQ | Solid clone; sweet spots for gain are narrow |
| [[Warm Audio]] WA73 | Entry-level; gets you in the neighborhood at lowest cost |
| Aurora Audio GTQC | Different take on the Neve progression by former Neve engineer Geoff Tanner |
| [[Great River]] MP2NV | "Neve-inspired" with its own character; killer DI; some find a "zip" to the top end |
| [[Chandler Limited]] TG2 | "Weight of a Neve but the speed of an API" per BatMeckley |

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming all 1073s sound the same.** Eric Martin noted that "none of the 4 old 1073s sounded the same either." Vintage units drift, and clones each have their own character.
- **Forgetting the kill switch** in the middle of the gain knob rotation.
- **Expecting the EQ to behave like a surgical tool.** The 1073 EQ is broad and musical, not precise. Use it for tone shaping, not corrective work.
- **Ignoring downstream implications.** BatMeckley realized that choosing a preamp without considering what compression, saturation, and EQ you use later led to vocals that "just weren't sitting right."
- **Calling every Neve-style pre a "1073."** The community strongly feels that BAE, Vintech, Heritage, and other clones should be discussed on their own merits rather than treated as interchangeable with vintage originals.
