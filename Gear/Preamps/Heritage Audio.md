# Heritage Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Heritage Audio is a manufacturer producing Neve-inspired preamps, compressors, and monitor controllers at accessible price points. They are perhaps best known in the community for the Grandchild 670, a 500-series Fairchild compressor clone, and the Baby RAM monitor controller. The brand occupies a budget-to-mid tier position in the Neve-clone market.

## Key Characteristics

- Neve-inspired preamp designs in 500-series format
- Grandchild 670: A 500-series stereo compressor based on the [[Fairchild 670]] circuit ($1,999)
- Baby RAM monitor controller for budget studio setups
- BritStrip channel strip with EQ that has been positively received
- Generally positioned as affordable alternatives to higher-end British-voiced gear

## Use Cases

- Budget studios seeking Neve-style coloration in 500-series format
- Monitor control on a budget (Baby RAM)
- 500-series Fairchild-style compression (Grandchild)
- Tracking EQ with the BritStrip channel strip

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The BritStrip EQ has been used successfully for tone shaping during tracking
- The Baby RAM is functional but not universally loved at the higher end

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[BAE Audio]] | More respected Neve clones at a higher price |
| [[Vintech]] | Higher-quality Neve reproduction |
| Warm Audio | Similar budget tier with different product focus |
| AML | Community-preferred budget Neve alternative |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting the Grandchild 670 to replicate a real Fairchild — "Fairchild at home" status
- Buying the Baby RAM without researching whether higher-end monitor controllers would better serve your needs
- Not auditioning Heritage against AML or other budget Neve alternatives
