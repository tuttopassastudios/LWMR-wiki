# Audient ASP880

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Audient ASP880 is an 8-channel preamp/converter unit that offers solid sound quality at a budget-friendly price point. However, it is plagued by well-documented reliability issues, with multiple community members reporting premature unit failure from AD converter or power supply problems. The sound is fine when it works, but the reliability concerns are a serious consideration.

## Key Characteristics

- 8-channel mic preamp with built-in AD conversion via ADAT output
- Budget-friendly price point for the channel count
- Known reliability issues — units frequently die from AD converter or power supply failure
- Runs hot and benefits from rack ventilation
- The older ASP800 has similar heat and longevity concerns
- Audient's customer support has been criticized for slow turnaround and high repair costs

## Use Cases

- Budget multi-channel drum recording (when it works)
- Additional preamp channels for studios on a tight budget
- Entry-level outboard preamp before upgrading to higher-end units

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Give the unit breathing room in the rack — heat is a primary cause of failure
- Adding an external fan has been reported as a workaround for the thermal issues

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Focusrite ISA]] 828 | More reliable; slightly different sonic character |
| SPL P8 | New alternative filling the same product gap with better build quality |
| Ferrofish A32 | Converter-focused with preamp flexibility; praised for reliability |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying the ASP880 without researching the well-documented reliability issues
- Not providing adequate ventilation in the rack — heat buildup accelerates failure
- Spending $500 on a repair only to have the unit fail again shortly after
- Not budgeting for a replacement when the unit inevitably develops issues
