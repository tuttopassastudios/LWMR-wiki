# Chandler Limited

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Chandler Limited, designed by Wade Goeke, produces some of the most revered boutique preamps in modern recording. Their lineup draws heavily from Abbey Road Studios heritage, with the TG2 and TG Channel being direct descendants of the EMI TG12345 console, and the REDD.47 recreating the valve-based REDD desk used on early Beatles records. Within the LWMR community, the Chandler TG2 in particular has developed a near-cult following for vocals, with BatMeckley crediting it as the preamp that "literally saved my job and possibly career."

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Transformer-coupled solid-state (TG series), valve-based (REDD series), germanium transistor (Germanium series)
- **Topology:** Varies by model; TG series uses discrete transistor gain stages inspired by EMI designs
- **Notable Features:**
  - TG2: Dual-mono preamp with extra gain stage, massive gain on tap
  - TG Channel: Preamp with built-in EQ (including switchable high-pass filter) and limiter
  - REDD.47: Tube-based preamp with extraordinary low-end extension
  - Germanium Preamp: Temperature-sensitive germanium transistor design
  - Curve Bender: Inductor-based parametric EQ (separate unit)

## Use Cases

### TG2 / TG Channel -- The Vocal Preamp

The TG2 is one of the most endorsed vocal preamps in the community:

- **BatMeckley:** "Can't recommend the TG2 enough. I keep trying other pres and for vocals and guitars, they just seem to tickle the harmonics in a specific way that really makes things sit in a track for me."
- **BatMeckley on the sound:** "Feel like it has the weight of a Neve but the speed of an API." This unique positioning -- dense yet transient-forward -- is what makes it work so well in modern pop and rock vocal production.
- **ehutton21:** "I feel like I know a sizable amount of vocal producers who swear by a Chandler TG2 for vocals."
- **popaganda.:** "My first pre and main vox pre was TG2 and I've never regretted that or switched. The mids on that are beautiful."

BatMeckley's origin story with the TG2 is notable: "A chance run-in with Jerry Finn at the studio where he hipped me to the TG2 + 1176 combo literally saved my job and possibly career" after struggling with the conventional "Neve through CL1B" chain.

### TG2 vs. TG Channel

- The TG2 (dual-mono, preamp only) has an extra gain stage and more gain on tap than the TG Channel
- BatMeckley actually prefers the TG Channel for vocals "precisely because of the low cut" filter and musical EQ, despite most engineers (Max, Luke) using TG2s exclusively
- The TG Channel's EQ is described as "ultra musical"

### REDD.47

- **BatMeckley:** "One of the biggest reasons I don't use the Chandler REDD mic is because they have such incredible low end extension that room rumble and artist noise can be a problem sometimes. Otherwise they sound FANTASTIC."
- **hyanrarvey:** "The REDD's a fuckin vibe box."
- **jantrit:** "DI guitar into one driven hard and patched into another is a really fun time." BatMeckley confirmed: "THIS re: the guitar part. Very Beatles."
- A persistent challenge: Finding an inline HPF that does not affect the REDD's tone. BatMeckley had Wade custom-mod his TG2s with switchable high-pass filters, but could not convince Wade to add one to the REDD.

### Germanium Preamp

- Uses germanium transistors which clip differently from silicon and are temperature-sensitive
- **BatMeckley:** Germanium is "awesome, esp for guitar" but temperature sensitivity makes it impractical for touring
- **David Fuller:** "Germanium transistors and diodes behave pretty differently from silicon -- they clip a bit differently, but also they are stupid temperature sensitive."

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- **TG2 + 1176 combo:** BatMeckley's signature vocal chain. He gain-stages by blending TG2 character with 1176 input gain: "1176 gain tends to be a bit harder and leaner, sometimes noisier, so I just see what character that gain has and I know the TG character and then I just blend to taste, not unlike an old 4-hole Marshall guitar amp."
- **TG Channel EQ:** Use the HPF to control low-end buildup before hitting a compressor. A little high-end lift can add presence without harshness.
- **REDD for re-amping:** Running digital sources through a REDD at tracking levels adds significant vibe, but jantrit warns "you'd have to mix into it from pretty early on because the change was definitely enough to make you want to change things."

## 500 Series vs. Full-Size

This is a critical distinction for Chandler gear:

- **BatMeckley:** "Oh man I have thoughts. I love Chandler. I love Wade. My whole vocal career based largely on the TG2 sound. But. The 500 series ain't it. It's a perfectly fine pre. But it's no TG2. They're different."
- BatMeckley went so far as to unrack his full-size TG pres and bring them to sessions at NightBird Studios because "all they had were the 500 versions and they just weren't it."
- The full-size TG2's extra gain stage is a meaningful sonic difference, not just a convenience feature.

## Build Quality Concerns

- **peterlabberton:** "In my experience both with outboard and mics, Chandler build quality isn't quite what you'd hope. My old studio had a Curve Bender with wonky switches that'd cut out randomly. You think for a $5k-$6k EQ they could use more reliable parts."
- This is noted as an exception rather than a widespread issue, but worth considering at these price points.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Neve 1073]] | More density/weight but less speed; 1073 is the traditional choice, TG2 is the modern alternative |
| [[Undertone Audio]] MPDI-4 | BatMeckley: both are "incredibly high quality pieces of kit" -- preference comes down to workflow |
| [[BAE Audio]] 1073 | More traditional Neve sound; TG2 splits the difference between Neve and API |
| [[API Preamps]] | Faster/punchier but less weight than TG2 |
| [[Great River]] MP2NV | Neve-inspired alternative; BatMeckley preferred Great Rivers over 500-series Neves and Chandlers at one studio |

## Common Mistakes

- **Buying the 500-series version expecting TG2 sound.** The full-size unit is meaningfully different and worth the extra investment.
- **Not accounting for low-end on the REDD.** Without a HPF, room rumble and plosives can be problematic.
- **Ignoring the TG Channel in favor of the TG2.** The TG Channel's built-in EQ and HPF can be more practical for many workflows.
- **Expecting the REDD to be a set-and-forget preamp.** Its extreme vibe and coloration means you need to commit to its sound early in the production process.
