# Daking

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Daking preamps are based on the classic [[Trident]] console circuit topology, offering a relaxed and three-dimensional sound that has been favored by many engineers for drum recording. The units use Jensen transformers on inputs and outputs, and the brand carries a strong reputation among those who value the Trident lineage. Vintage Daking consoles are considered collector items.

## Key Characteristics

- Circuit design based on the [[Trident]] console topology
- Jensen transformers on both inputs and outputs
- More consistent unit-to-unit than the original Trident transformers, which were more variable
- Available as standalone preamp/EQ units and (rarely) as full consoles
- The vintage green Daking consoles are highly sought after

## Use Cases

- Drum recording — a favorite application among community members
- Full tracking sessions where the Trident-style open, relaxed sound is desired
- Pairing with compression for a complete channel path

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The Trident/Daking sound excels at capturing drums with dimension and space
- Works well as a complement to more saturated Neve-style preamps in a multi-preamp setup

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Trident]] | The original circuit design; Daking is a faithful reproduction with modern components |
| [[Neve 1073]] | More saturated mid-forward character vs. Daking's relaxed openness |
| [[API Preamps]] | Different flavor of punch; API is tighter, Daking more spacious |

## Common Mistakes

- Getting into debates about transformer authenticity — the modern Jensen transformers are arguably more consistent than the originals
- Overlooking Daking because it lacks the "brand name weight" of Neve or API
