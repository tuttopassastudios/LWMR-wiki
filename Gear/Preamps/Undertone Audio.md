# Undertone Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Undertone Audio (UTA) is a boutique manufacturer founded by Eric Dela Cruz, known for versatile, high-quality preamps and channel strips. The MPDI-4 and the discontinued MPEQ-1 are community favorites. UTA gear is described as "incredibly versatile" and "made for the everyday recording engineer," with a mic preamp that ranges from crystal clean to usable distortion and a DI flatter than an [[Avalon VT-737|Avalon U5]].

## Key Characteristics

- **MPDI-4**: Four-channel mic preamp with built-in DI, praised as a major upgrade from interface preamps
- **MPEQ-1** (discontinued): Combined mic preamp, DI, and parametric EQ described as criminally undervalued — "should be worth 5x what it's selling for"
- The EQ on the MPEQ-1 is unique and difficult to grasp but does things "no other EQs do in the hardware world"
- DI section is flatter than an [[Avalon VT-737|Avalon U5]], making it excellent for clean DI capture
- Mic preamp can go from crystal clean to usable distortion
- Also makes a Varicap cable system for guitar DI recording

## Use Cases

- Vocal tracking — versatile enough to handle any genre
- Clean DI capture for bass and guitar reamping
- MPEQ-1 used across mix bus with gentle Pultec-style boosts
- Swiss army knife EQ for problem-solving difficult sources
- Replacement for interface preamps as a significant step up

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- MPEQ-1 on mix bus with gentle low and high shelf boosts — "incredibly musical"
- The MPEQ-1 manual includes recipes for replicating [[Pultec EQP-1A|Pultec]], [[API 550]], and other classic EQ curves
- Clean DI with Varicap cable for guitar captures intended for reamping

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Chandler Limited]] TG Channel | Different flavor; some prefer Chandler for vocals, UTA for flexibility |
| [[Neve 1073]] / [[BAE Audio]] | More colored; UTA offers broader tonal range |
| [[Focusrite ISA]] / [[Audient ASP880]] | Budget alternatives that UTA significantly upgrades from |
| Fearn VT-1 | Different color; tube-based alternative |

## Common Mistakes

- Dismissing the MPEQ-1 EQ as too complex without investing time to learn it
- Not realizing the MPEQ-1 is discontinued and increasing in value on the used market
- Expecting 500-series headroom from UTA gear — the full-size units have significantly more headroom
- Overlooking the DI section, which is one of the flattest available
