# Trident

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Trident consoles and preamps are known for a relaxed, three-dimensional sound that contrasts with the more saturated Neve topology. The Trident A-Range and Series 80 circuits have influenced numerous designs including [[Daking]] preamps. In community shootouts, Trident console preamps are described as "more relaxed and 3D" compared to the heavier saturation of Neve-style preamps.

## Key Characteristics

- Transformer-less preamp designs in some models (e.g., the rare 90 Series) offering a cool, clear, open, neutral sound
- The classic Trident sound is described as relaxed, open, and three-dimensional
- Flexible 4-band EQ sections on console channels
- The Trident 88 and Burbank Audio Systems 75 are newer console options
- The Trident circuit topology is the basis for [[Daking]] preamps

## Use Cases

- Drum recording — engineers who grew up on Trident-recorded records praise the drum sound
- Full tracking sessions where a less colored, more open sound is desired
- Mix-and-match with colored preamps (Neve, tube) for variety across sources
- Console-based workflows with at least 32 mic channels

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The EQ is fantastically flexible with 4 bands plus high and low filters
- Works well as a neutral foundation that allows outboard color (tube, transformer) to be added selectively
- In shootouts against Warm Audio Neve clones, the Trident sounds less saturated but more spatially dimensional

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Daking]] | Based on Trident circuit; available as standalone preamps with Jensen transformers |
| [[Neve 1073]] | More saturated and mid-forward; different character entirely |
| Warm Audio WA73 | More saturated in shootouts; Trident preferred for openness |
| [[API Preamps]] | Different flavor of color; API is punchier, Trident more relaxed |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting a Trident to sound like a Neve — they are fundamentally different sonic characters
- Overlooking the Trident EQ section, which is one of its greatest strengths
- Dismissing Trident preamps as "not colorful enough" without understanding their spatial qualities
