# Focusrite ISA

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Focusrite ISA series preamps are considered the best "bang for buck" preamps available, offering solid performance that punches above their price point. Based on the original Rupert Neve-designed Focusrite ISA 110 circuit, they provide a slightly colored sound with good headroom. They are often the preamp that engineers upgrade from when moving to higher-end outboard.

## Key Characteristics

- Based on the original Rupert Neve-designed ISA 110 transformer-based circuit
- Available in multi-channel formats (ISA 828 with 8 channels) making them practical for drum recording
- Slightly colored sound — not as neutral as the [[Millennia HV-3]] but not as saturated as a [[Neve 1073]]
- Built-in converter options available on some models
- Reliable and road-worthy build quality

## Use Cases

- Multi-channel drum recording on a budget
- First serious outboard preamp upgrade from interface preamps
- Workhorse preamp for studios needing many clean-ish channels
- Location recording where channel count and reliability matter

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Impedance switching provides tonal flexibility with different microphones
- Works well as a foundation alongside more colored boutique preamps

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Audient ASP880]] | Similar price bracket; known reliability issues |
| [[Millennia HV-3]] | More transparent but significantly more expensive |
| AML | Preferred by some over ISA for Neve-style tone at similar price |
| [[Undertone Audio]] MPDI-4 | Significant upgrade from ISA; described as "game changer" by former ISA users |

## Common Mistakes

- Staying with ISA preamps too long when the budget allows for a meaningful upgrade to boutique units
- Overlooking the impedance switching feature, which can meaningfully change the mic/pre interaction
- Expecting ISA preamps to provide the same saturation character as a true [[Neve 1073]]
