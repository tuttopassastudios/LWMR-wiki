# CAPI VP28

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The CAPI VP28 is a 500-series API-style preamp available as a DIY kit or pre-built unit. It is highly regarded for its sound quality relative to cost, especially for drums and instruments. Community members describe it as a legitimate alternative to original API preamps, with some reporting it made their API 3124 "sound like plastic" by comparison.

## Key Characteristics

- API-style 500-series preamp with transformer-coupled output
- Available as a DIY kit, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to get high-quality preamps in quantity
- Multiple tiers of op-amps available — top-shelf op-amps are recommended for closest performance to original API units
- Produces a punchy, colored sound characteristic of the API topology
- Not considered ideal for vocals by some engineers, who prefer warmer or more detailed preamps for that application

## Use Cases

- Drum tracking — engineers have built 16 channels specifically for multi-mic drum recording
- Electric guitar and bass DI
- General instrument recording where API-style punch and color is desired
- Studios that need many channels of quality preamps on a budget

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- With the right (top-shelf) op-amp, the sound closely matches original API preamps
- Works well paired with [[API 550]] series EQs in a 500-series lunchbox
- For vocals, many engineers prefer pairing CAPI preamps with other gear or choosing a different preamp entirely

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[API Preamps]] 3124 | The original; CAPI VP28 users report comparable or preferred sound |
| Coil Audio CA-70 | Deep and thick character; can be too much for some sources |
| Coil Audio 286 | Safer, more versatile option than the CA-70 |
| [[Undertone Audio]] MPDI-4 | Different topology but recommended as an upgrade path from CAPI/ISA setups |

## Common Mistakes

- Cheaping out on op-amps — the top-shelf op-amps make a significant difference in matching original API character
- Using CAPI preamps exclusively for vocals when warmer alternatives may serve better
- Being intimidated by the DIY build — you can also purchase them assembled for still less than original API units
