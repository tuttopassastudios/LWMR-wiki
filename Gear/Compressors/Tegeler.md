# Tegeler

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Tegeler Audio Manufaktur is a German manufacturer of tube-based compressors and other analog processing. While their designs have attracted interest, the community has reported significant reliability and customer service issues. One user spent nearly a year getting a refund on a unit that was defective from arrival. Tube replacement requires some knowledge, and ordering tubes directly from Tegeler is recommended.

## Key Characteristics

- German-made tube compressors
- The VTC (Vari Tube Compressor) is the most discussed product
- Uses E88CC and 12AX7 tubes
- Reliability concerns reported by multiple users
- Tube replacement should use Tegeler-selected tubes for best results

## Use Cases

- Mix bus compression (tube character)
- Mastering chain processing

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Manley Vari-Mu]] | More established and reliable tube bus compressor |
| [[Elysia]] | German-made alternative with better community reputation |
| IGS Tubecore | Similar price bracket; also has reliability concerns |

## Common Mistakes

- Not ordering replacement tubes directly from Tegeler — they select tubes for specific circuit characteristics
- Buying without factoring in potential reliability and customer service issues
- Using generic tube replacements without understanding circuit requirements
