# SSL Bus Compressor

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The SSL Bus Compressor (G384/G-series) is one of the most iconic mix bus compressors in recording history. Built around a VCA design originally using dbx VCA components, it became the template for the "glue" compressor concept. Available as standalone hardware, 500-series modules, and numerous plugin emulations, it remains a standard tool across genres.

## Key Characteristics

- VCA-based bus compressor with the signature SSL "glue"
- Original units used dbx-made VCA components; later versions switched to THAT VCAs
- The difference between dbx VCA and THAT VCA versions is debated
- Available in multiple hardware formats and extensively modeled in plugins
- 500-series versions exist but are viewed skeptically — "marketing, not engineering"

## Use Cases

- Mix bus compression — the definitive use case
- Stem bus compression
- Print compression for final mixes

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[dbx 160]] | Shares VCA heritage; budget entry into VCA compression |
| Audioscape G-Bus clone | Well-regarded; "sounds great" |
| Plugin emulations | SSL's own, Waves, UAD, Plugin Alliance all offer versions |
| [[WesAudio]] ngBusComp | Digitally recallable alternative |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming 500-series SSL bus comp modules deliver the same experience as full-rack units
- Not recognizing that every company's SSL bus comp plugin "is slightly different"
- Obsessing over the dbx vs. THAT VCA debate
