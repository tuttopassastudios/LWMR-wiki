# Stam Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Stam Audio is a manufacturer of affordable clone/tribute gear including compressors, preamps, EQs, and microphones. The quality of the actual products is generally well-regarded, but the company is notorious for extremely long delivery times. Products include the SA-87 microphone, SA-23A compressor, Sontec EQ clone, and an API 312 variant with a tube input stage.

## Key Characteristics

- Budget-oriented clones and tributes of classic gear
- Notorious for not delivering on time — long wait times are a recurring complaint
- Once gear arrives, quality is generally considered decent
- Product line spans microphones, compressors, EQs, and preamps
- The SA-87T microphone is well-liked for pop vocal recording

## Use Cases

- Budget entry point into classic circuit designs
- The SA-87T stacks well and has nice top end for pop records
- The Sontec EQ clone has generated interest among those who like the original

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Audioscape | Better delivery reputation, faithful reproductions |
| Warm Audio | Similar price bracket, more readily available |
| Golden Age Project | Cheaper alternative for some products |

## Common Mistakes

- Not factoring in the extremely long wait times when ordering
- Expecting immediate availability — this is a wait-and-hope operation
