# Teletronix LA-2A

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Teletronix LA-2A is an electro-optical tube compressor renowned for its simplicity and musicality. With just two controls -- Gain and Peak Reduction -- it is the easiest compressor to operate in professional audio, yet its program-dependent behavior produces results that are difficult to replicate with more complex designs. Originally designed in the 1960s by Jim Lawrence, the LA-2A uses a T4B electro-optical attenuator (an electroluminescent panel coupled with a photoresistor) that gives it a uniquely smooth, natural compression character. The LA-2A is a staple on vocals and bass in studios worldwide, though some community members (including cian riordan) consider it too slow for modern vocal tracking applications.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Electro-optical with tube gain stage
- **Topology:** Single-channel tube amplifier with T4B opto cell for gain reduction, transformer-coupled output
- **Notable Features:**
  - Only two controls: Gain (output) and Peak Reduction (threshold/amount)
  - Limit/Compress switch (changes ratio behavior)
  - Program-dependent attack and release -- the T4B cell responds differently based on the amplitude and duration of the input signal
  - Dual time constants: fast attack (~10ms) with a two-stage release (initial fast release ~60ms, then slow recovery over several seconds)
  - Tube gain stage adds harmonic warmth
  - The T4B cell "memorizes" recent signal history, creating a compression behavior that adapts over time
  - Each unit sounds slightly different due to the organic nature of the opto cell

## Use Cases

When and why engineers reach for the LA-2A:

- **Vocal leveling** -- briantaylor describes his typical LA studio chain: "251 or 67 > Neve > EQP-1A > LA-2A. I love the depth and overall tone." The LA-2A excels at smooth, transparent vocal leveling where the compression should not be heard as an effect.
- **Bass guitar** -- One of the most universally agreed-upon applications. BatMeckley: "Hard to go wrong with an 1176 style for your one compressor. Better than an LA-2A unless you're only doing vocals and/or bass." The slow, smooth response is ideal for bass dynamics.
- **Acoustic instruments** -- The gentle, program-dependent behavior works well on acoustic guitar and other dynamic acoustic sources.
- **Saturation / distortion tool** -- cian riordan mentions "misusing" the LA-2A (along with the 610 and other tube circuits) for saturation effects, driving it harder than intended for harmonic distortion. Isaac joel describes the DIY Colourupter as "basically an optical compressor circuit ran inversely... has the sound of an LA-2A running in the red but without the compression element."
- **Set-and-forget applications** -- The simplicity of two knobs makes it ideal for situations where you need consistent, musical compression without constant adjustment.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

Commonly referenced settings from experienced engineers:

- **Vocal tracking:** Set Peak Reduction until you see 3-5 dB of gain reduction on peaks, adjust Gain to compensate. The program-dependent release does the rest. Keep it simple -- that is the entire point of the LA-2A.
- **Limit vs. Compress mode:** Limit mode (default) provides a higher ratio with faster response. Compress mode offers a gentler ratio -- useful for more transparent leveling.
- **Bass DI:** Moderate Peak Reduction to smooth out level inconsistencies. The slow release prevents the characteristic "pumping" that faster compressors exhibit on bass.
- **Driving it for tone:** Push the Peak Reduction harder than intended for tube saturation and harmonic enrichment. Not the "correct" use, but valued by engineers seeking color.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Tube-Tech CL1B]] | Edward Rivera: "Think of it as an LA2A with extra controls." The CL1B offers variable attack, release, and ratio where the LA-2A has none. BatMeckley: "CL1B not my thing, but there's no doubt it's one of the most used and revered comps in the game." |
| [[UREI 1176]] | Faster, more aggressive, more controls. BatMeckley considers the 1176 a better "one compressor" choice because it handles more source types. Geoff Emerick told BatMeckley he would reach for an 1176 over a [[Fairchild 670\|Fairchild]] and be just as happy. |
| Audioscape LA-2A clone | hyanrarvey suggests it as a more affordable alternative: "Hell I'd even go Audioscape LA-2A." |
| Inward Connections Brute | DarrenB: "A nice opto" -- similar optical compression territory at a different price point. Thegreatcarsoni uses it regularly and finds "it has more of a 2A thing going on." |
| UAD LA-2A Plugin (Silver) | Ross Fortune notes UAD's "1176 and LA-2A collections are excellent." Maxim calls the "LA-2A Silver fantastic." BatMeckley recalls when UAD made "far and away the best sounding 1176 or LA-2A" plugins. |
| PSP Old Timer | Zach Hughes suggests it as a "valve type comp option" alternative to the UAD LA-2A. |

## Common Mistakes

- **Using it as a vocal tracking compressor on fast material** -- cian riordan is direct: "LA-2A styles are too slow for vocal tracking." The program-dependent release means it cannot catch fast transients the way an [[UREI 1176]] or [[Empirical Labs Distressor]] can. It works for smooth vocal styles but struggles with percussive or highly dynamic vocal performances.
- **Expecting it to be a one-size-fits-all compressor** -- BatMeckley ranks it below the 1176 as a general-purpose tracking tool: "Better than an LA-2A unless you're only doing vocals and/or bass." Its limited controls mean limited flexibility.
- **Maintenance anxiety preventing purchase** -- briantaylor expressed hesitation about buying vintage due to maintenance costs. hyanrarvey reassures: "Old gear usually lasts for fucking ever you just gotta maintain it, which in LA techs will charge you an arm and a leg to do."
- **Over-relying on plugin versions** -- While UAD's emulations are well-regarded, Ross Fortune notes that finding alternatives to UAD's LA-2A and 1176 plugins is worthwhile to avoid ecosystem lock-in.
- **Not understanding the two-stage release** -- The LA-2A's release is not a single time constant. The initial fast release followed by a slow recovery is what gives it its musical character. Engineers who expect a simple, predictable release curve may misinterpret what the compressor is doing.
