# Burl Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Burl Audio is primarily known for their converters (AD/DA) rather than compressors, though they appear in compression and signal chain discussions due to their transformer-loaded design philosophy. The Burl B2 converter is designed to add analog coloration through its transformers, which has generated both enthusiasm and skepticism in the community. Opinions are sharply divided on whether colored converters are beneficial or cynical.

## Key Characteristics

- Transformer-loaded converters designed to add analog character
- The B2 is the most commonly discussed product
- Designed to run "hotter" due to transformers across the inputs
- When properly level-matched against transparent converters, the difference largely disappears
- Controversial in mastering circles where transparency is preferred

## Use Cases

- Production and tracking where analog coloration is desired throughout the signal path
- Studios wanting a "beefed up" version of their mixes
- Not recommended for mastering by several community members

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Lynx Aurora | Transparent alternative; virtually identical when level-matched |
| Avid HD I/O | Professional standard; near-identical in proper A/B tests |
| JCF Audio | Similar colored converter philosophy |

## Common Mistakes

- Not level-matching when comparing to other converters — even 0.1 dB difference will bias the test
- Prioritizing converter upgrades over more impactful purchases like instruments, microphones, or room treatment
- Assuming "sounds different" means "sounds better"

> "Burl sent 16x16 channels of I/O to the studio I worked for to demo. We carefully set them up against the Avid I/O and at first the difference was distinct. However... we quickly realized that Burl had sent them to us cal'd hotter! As soon as we cal'd them properly, they were virtually identical." — BillyC
