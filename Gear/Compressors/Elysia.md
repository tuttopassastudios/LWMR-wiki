# Elysia

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Elysia is a German manufacturer of high-quality analog dynamics processors and EQs. The Xpressor compressor and Alpha mastering compressor are their most discussed products. The Xpressor is described as a "sleeper" — incredibly versatile but with a learning curve. Service requires shipping to Germany, which can mean lengthy turnaround times.

## Key Characteristics

- German-built, high-quality analog processing
- The Xpressor can go from explosive to subtle compression
- Gain reduction limiter feature prevents compression from getting too extreme
- The Xfilter companion EQ is also well-regarded
- Difficult to recall settings, which limits use as a mix bus hardware insert
- Repair/service may require shipping to Germany (83-day turnaround reported)

## Use Cases

- Drum room compression
- Mix bus processing
- Overhead compression
- Mastering (Alpha model)

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[SSL Bus Compressor]] | More conventional bus compression |
| [[Empirical Labs Distressor]] | Similar versatility range |

## Common Mistakes

- Not accounting for the recall difficulty when using on mix bus
- Underestimating the service/repair timeline if shipping to Germany is required
