# Tube-Tech CL1B

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Tube-Tech CL1B is an optical tube compressor that became the de facto vocal tracking compressor for pop, R&B, and hip-hop over the last two decades. Paired with a [[Neve 1073]] preamp and a large-diaphragm condenser, the CL1B chain has been used on artists from Chris Brown to Ty Dolla Sign. The unit is increasingly valued as an investment -- hyanrarvey predicts they will "hit 10k in like 3 years" -- partly because Tube-Tech has signaled difficulty continuing production. Community opinion is notably divided: some consider it one of the most revered compressors in the game, while others (including BatMeckley and cian riordan) find it overrated compared to alternatives.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** Optical (T4B-style opto cell) with tube gain stage
- **Topology:** Single-channel tube compressor with optical gain reduction element
- **Notable Features:**
  - Variable attack (0.5ms to 300ms) and release (50ms to 10s) controls -- more flexible than an [[Teletronix LA-2A|LA-2A]]
  - Fixed threshold with variable ratio (2:1 to 10:1)
  - Tube makeup gain stage adds warmth and harmonic richness
  - Sidechain high-pass filter
  - Production units vary in sound depending on year of manufacture -- older units reportedly sound different from newer ones

## Use Cases

When and why engineers reach for the CL1B:

- **Pop/R&B/Hip-hop vocal tracking** -- The industry-standard vocal chain for over a decade. DavidDosi calls the 1073 > CL1B path "somewhat of an industry standard in the last 10 years." Parkerdylanj notes: "Vocals just seem to pop out of the mix when ran through the hardware chain."
- **Smooth, transparent compression** -- Ideal when you want compression that does not draw attention to itself. Edward Rivera describes it as "an LA2A with extra controls."
- **Bass DI** -- Iwan Morgan found it "did something nice to the pick attack" on bass DI.
- **General tracking** -- BatMeckley acknowledges it is "one of the most used and revered comps in the game" even though it is not his personal preference.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

Commonly referenced settings from experienced engineers:

- **Pop/R&B vocals:** Moderate ratio (3:1 to 4:1), medium attack to let transients through, medium-slow release. Let the optical element do its program-dependent thing. Avoid slamming it -- onanisland warns: "even a real CL1B is behaving differently depending on production year."
- **Gentle vocal leveling:** Low ratio, slow attack. The optical element naturally responds to program material, providing smooth level control without obvious compression artifacts.
- **Plugin usage (Softube CL1B):** The plugin has both Mk1 and Mk2 modes. Multiple community members (Iwan Morgan, Ross Fortune, vostral) find the plugin overly aggressive -- "feels very compressed, very quickly" and "nothing nothing nothing... way too much." Onanisland clarifies that one of the two modes "sucks" while the other "behaves more like a real CL1B."

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Teletronix LA-2A]] | Simpler controls (just gain and peak reduction). The CL1B offers more flexibility with variable attack, release, and ratio. Edward Rivera frames the CL1B as "an LA2A with extra controls." Some engineers (onanisland, Edward Rivera) dislike both on vocals. |
| [[Retro Sta-Level]] | BatMeckley: "It's a fat slow very specific low end harmonix boosting beast" -- totally different character. CL1B is more flexible and has better resale. |
| Elysia Nvelope / BG2 | cian riordan would "sell it and invest in an Rcomp" or BG2 instead. |
| Softube CL1B Plugin | Has both Mk1 and Mk2 models. Divisive -- onanisland says one mode is "almost 1:1 with the hardware." Others find it unusable. |
| Audioscape / Kiive clones | Hardware alternatives mentioned by onanisland as CL1B-adjacent options at lower price points. |

## Common Mistakes

- **Trading or selling too early** -- hyanrarvey strongly warns against selling: "Hold on to that CL1B till it buys you a car or house." Prices have risen from ~$3,000 to $5,000-$7,000+ on the used market, with some selling for as much as $7,000.
- **Expecting it to work for everyone** -- Despite its reputation, several experienced engineers (BatMeckley, cian riordan, onanisland) do not personally favor it. BatMeckley: "I actually have made a conscious choice to not own either [CL1B or Sta-Level]." cian riordan: "CL1B ain't my cup of tea."
- **Confusing the plugin with the hardware** -- The Softube emulation, while having one decent mode, does not fully capture the hardware experience. Multiple members report the plugin feels overly grabby compared to the real unit.
- **Ignoring production year variance** -- Newer and older CL1B hardware units sound different from each other. This is an underappreciated factor when evaluating the compressor.
- **Buying based on celebrity signal chains** -- onanisland cautions it is an "overhyped comp, just like the Avalon was in the early 2000s to 2010s" -- purchased because a famous engineer uses it rather than because it suits the buyer's workflow.
