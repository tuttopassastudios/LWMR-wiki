# Spectra 1964

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Spectra 1964 manufactures 500-series preamps, DI boxes, and compressors that have earned enthusiastic praise from those who use them. The STX600 preamp is described as "amazing" for drums, and the BBDI is favored for synths and keyboards. Their products are characterized by clean signal paths and excellent low-end extension.

## Key Characteristics

- 500-series format preamps and DI boxes
- The STX600 preamp excels on kick and snare — described as "game-changingly easy to get a killer sound"
- The BBDI passes all the low end cleanly — superior to Radial DI boxes in this regard
- Super clean signal path
- Less EQ needed when tracking through Spectra preamps

## Use Cases

- Drum recording (kick and snare through STX600)
- Synth and keyboard recording (BBDI)
- Wurlitzer and Rhodes DI
- Any application requiring clean, full-range signal capture

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Radial DI boxes | Clean but don't pass low end as well |
| Great River preamps | Complementary pairing with Spectra gear |
| API 550b EQs | Can be paired with STX600s but watch input headroom |

## Common Mistakes

- The STX600 preamps may hit the front end of some EQs (like API 550b) too hard — watch gain staging
