# Purple Audio MC77

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Purple Audio MC77 is an 1176-style FET compressor that has earned a loyal following for its punchy, clear sound. It is considered one of the better 1176 clones available, with better headroom and fidelity than budget alternatives, though some feel it runs a touch cleaner/brighter than the original UA units. Opinions vary — some love it, others prefer the UA reissue.

## Key Characteristics

- FET compressor in the 1176 lineage
- Better headroom, noise floor, and fidelity than budget 1176 clones
- Slightly cleaner and possibly brighter than the original UA 1176
- Well-built and reliable

## Use Cases

- Lead vocals — "attack at noon, release fully fast, adjust gains till it feels like a record"
- Rap vocals (with a low-pass filter before the compressor)
- General tracking compression

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Attack at noon (12 o'clock)
- Release fully fast
- Adjust input/output gains until it feels right

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[UREI 1176]] (UA Reissue) | The reference standard; some prefer it over the MC77 |
| [[Empirical Labs Distressor]] | More versatile but different character |
| Audioscape 1176 clone | "Fine but a bit too noisy/crunchy" |
| Warm Audio 1176 clone | Lacks headroom and fidelity |

## Common Mistakes

- Most 1176 clones "sound like a caricature of what Gearspace posts say that an 1176 should sound like" — the MC77 largely avoids this but is still not identical to the original
- Some top engineers (Luke from Record Plant) considered it "too bright"
