# Retro Sta-Level

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Retro Sta-Level is a single-channel tube compressor known for its fat, colorful character and forgiving behavior. While visually resembling an LA-2A, it operates on a completely different principle — described as "a fat slow very specific low end harmonics boosting beast." It divides opinion: loved by those who want color, but considered too specific for versatile studio use.

## Key Characteristics

- Tube-based compression with significant harmonic coloration
- Adds weight and low-end richness to sources
- Forgiving and easy to use — hard to make it sound bad
- Very specific sonic character — not a general-purpose compressor
- Looks like an LA-2A but sounds nothing like one

## Use Cases

- Bass guitar — frequently cited as its strongest application
- Vocals where color and weight are desired (not clean pop vocals)
- Any source where low-end harmonics and fullness are the goal
- Part of a "one recording chain" setup: Soyuz 017 Tube > NEVE 1073 > Sta-Level

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Described as forgiving — difficult to get a bad sound from it
- Can be tricky for super clean pop vocals due to the coloration it adds

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Tube-Tech CL1B]] | More flexible, preferred by most for general use |
| [[Teletronix LA-2A]] | Despite visual similarity, completely different sound |
| [[Manley Vari-Mu]] | Another tube compressor option with different character |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming it works like an [[Teletronix LA-2A|LA-2A]] because of the similar layout — totally different thing
- Buying it as a general-purpose compressor when it excels in specific applications
- Not understanding its pronounced coloration before purchasing
