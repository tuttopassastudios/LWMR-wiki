# Black Lion Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Black Lion Audio manufactures a range of audio products including patchbays, preamps, modifications, and opto cells. While they produce some compressors and 1176-style units, the community notes these lack the headroom, noise floor, and fidelity of higher-end alternatives. Their patchbays and build quality are well-regarded.

## Key Characteristics

- Well-made hardware with solid build quality
- Patchbays (PBR TT series) are considered reliable
- The Auteur 4-channel preamp is an affordable multi-channel option
- T4 opto cells can be used to upgrade cheaper compressors (e.g., Klark Teknik LA-2A clone)
- 1176 clones described as lacking headroom, noise floor, and fidelity compared to originals

## Use Cases

- Budget studio infrastructure (patchbays, preamps)
- Modification parts (T4 opto cells) for upgrading cheaper gear
- Entry-level multi-channel preamp needs

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Purple Audio MC77]] | Better 1176-style alternative |
| Audioscape | Better clone quality at similar price points |
| Warm Audio | Competing budget tier |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting 1176 clones to match the original UA units in headroom and fidelity
