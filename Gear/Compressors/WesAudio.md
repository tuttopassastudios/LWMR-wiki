# WesAudio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> WesAudio is a Polish manufacturer producing digitally recallable analog hardware, including compressors, EQs, and other processing. Their products bridge the gap between analog character and plugin-style recall, making them appealing for engineers who want outboard sound with modern workflow. Notable products include the NG76 FET compressor, ngBusComp, and ngTubeComp.

## Key Characteristics

- **Digitally recallable analog hardware** — best-of-both-worlds approach
- Products include FET compressors, bus compressors, tube compressors, and tube EQs
- The NG76 includes saturation, mix control, and high-pass sidechain filter
- The ngTubeEQ runs around $6,000
- Plugin control integration for total recall capability

## Use Cases

- Mix bus compression with full recall capability
- Engineers who want analog character but need session recall
- The ngBusComp is used on the mix bus with transformer ("iron") mode options

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[SSL Bus Compressor]] | Traditional approach without digital recall |
| [[UREI 1176]] | The NG76 is an 1176-style design with extras |
| Softube Console 1 | Different approach to hardware control of plugins |

## Common Mistakes

- Not considering whether the recall feature justifies the premium over traditional analog
- Potential technical issues — one user reported channel imbalance that resolved when switching transformer modes
