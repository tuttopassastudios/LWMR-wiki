# dbx 160

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The dbx 160 family (160VU, 160x, 160A) is a line of VCA compressors known for punchy, aggressive compression at remarkably affordable prices. The 160x shares design DNA with the SSL channel compressor, as both use dbx VCA components. The community consensus is that everyone should own some form of dbx 160.

## Key Characteristics

- VCA-based compression with a snappy, punchy character
- The 160VU is considered the "holy grail" variant, but all versions are well-regarded
- The 160x sounds remarkably close to the SSL channel compressor — both share dbx VCA components
- Multiple variants: 160VU (original), 160x, 160A, XT — all are "still dbx 160s"
- Extremely affordable on the used market

## Use Cases

- Kick drum and bass — provides desired "smack"
- Organ and synth pads — controls non-transient heavy sources well
- General tracking compressor
- Budget alternative to SSL channel compression

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Drive into them hard for the signature aggressive compression
- The 160A pair works well for stereo applications on synths and keys

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[SSL Bus Compressor]] | Related design heritage via shared VCA components |
| [[UREI 1176]] | Different compression style but similar workhorse status |
| Plugin versions | "The plugin 160s do the thing" — cian riordan |

## Common Mistakes

- Confusing the variants — there are meaningful differences between the VU, x, A, and XT models
- Overlooking these in favor of more expensive compressors when the dbx would serve perfectly well
