# Behringer

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Behringer appears in community discussions primarily in the context of their P16 personal monitoring system rather than as a primary interface brand. The P16 system is mentioned as a budget-friendly alternative to Aviom-style personal monitor mixing, offering 16 channels at a significantly lower price point. The community acknowledges Behringer as a functional budget option but generally steers toward other brands for primary studio interfaces and conversion. Their products are seen as adequate when used within their limitations.

## Key Characteristics

- **P16 personal monitor system** -- 16-channel input module (~$260) with individual mixers (~$200 each); a budget Aviom alternative
- **Sounds good within limitations** -- "provided one doesn't slam it with unreasonable levels," the P16 performs well
- **Budget positioning** -- Behringer fills a gap for studios that need functional gear at the lowest possible cost
- **Not a primary interface recommendation** -- the community does not typically recommend Behringer as a primary studio interface for serious recording or mixing work
- **Aviom-style workflow** -- select a single channel then set parameters, rather than one-knob-per-channel

## Use Cases

- **Budget personal monitor mixing for tracking sessions** -- the P16 system offers individual monitor mixes via ethernet cabling
- **Simple studio monitoring expansion** -- adding headphone mixes without major investment
- **Ethernet-based monitoring** -- simpler wiring than large analog multi-cable runs

## Comparable Alternatives

| Product | Price Range | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Aviom | $500-$1,000+ | Better sound quality; single-channel selection workflow |
| Hear Technologies Hearback Pro | $300-$500/unit | One knob per channel; solved headroom and connector issues of original |
| Mytek monitoring | $800+ | Great usability; discontinued; power/cabling can be finicky |
| [[Focusrite Scarlett]] | $150-$500 | For actual interface needs at budget price |

## Common Mistakes

- **Sending hot levels to the P16** -- the system has limited headroom and will distort if you slam it with high levels; pad your sends
- **Expecting premium performance** -- functional and affordable, but not a substitute for higher-quality monitoring systems in critical applications
