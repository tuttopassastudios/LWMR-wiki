# Apogee

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Apogee Electronics is a long-standing name in professional audio conversion, with a product line spanning from the portable Duet to the flagship Symphony I/O Mk II. While the company's older products (Rosetta, AD/DA-16, original Ensemble) have a mixed reputation, the current generation, particularly the Symphony Mk II, is widely praised for conversion quality and has passionate advocates among high-profile engineers. Apogee is macOS-focused and has recently introduced its own DSP plugin ecosystem for real-time tracking.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type:** USB/Thunderbolt Audio Interface (macOS-focused)
- **Topology:** High-quality AD/DA conversion with optional onboard DSP processing
- **Notable Features:** Symphony I/O Mk II modular architecture with SE "mastering grade" cards, Apogee Control software, onboard DSP plugins (Pultec, LA-3A emulations), Duet 3 portable interface

## Use Cases

The Symphony I/O is the choice for engineers who prioritize conversion quality above all else and work exclusively on macOS. Multiple community members with billions of streams credit the Apogee sound as a key part of their signal chain. The Duet 3 serves as an excellent portable interface with conversion quality that punches above its weight. The Symphony Desktop bridges the gap for engineers who want Apogee conversion with a desktop form factor and built-in monitoring features.

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The Symphony Mk II is the sweet spot for serious studio use. One mastering engineer chose the Symphony II over a Crane Song HEDD in a blind A/B test, finding the HEDD sounded "cheap and harsh" in comparison.
- BatMeckley, who has worked on records with billions of streams, prefers Apogee conversion over Apollo, noting it sounds more three-dimensional where Apollo can feel "a hair 2D."
- Apogee's onboard Pultec and LA-3A plugin emulations are highly regarded, though their DSP ecosystem only supports Apogee's own plugins (no third-party support like Autotune).
- The Symphony Desktop is praised as a strong all-in-one option for engineers who want Apogee quality without committing to the full rack system.
- For expanding I/O, connecting ADAT preamps to the Ensemble or Symphony is a cost-effective way to add channels without replacing the converter.

## Comparable Alternatives

| Unit | How It Compares |
|------|----------------|
| [[Universal Audio Apollo]] | Apollo offers broader plugin ecosystem and real-time Autotune, but several community members prefer Apogee's conversion quality. Apollo's workflow advantages keep it dominant in commercial studios. |
| [[Lynx Aurora]] | Lynx wins for Atmos setups with integrated bass management. For stereo conversion quality, it is extremely close. One mastering engineer preferred the Hilo over the Symphony Mk I. |
| [[RME]] ADI-2/UCX II | RME offers superior driver stability and TotalMix routing. Apogee offers potentially better conversion quality at higher price points and tighter macOS integration. |
| [[Metric Halo]] LIO-8 | Similar pro-tier conversion with far superior DSP and future-proofing via 3d upgrade path. Some engineers have moved from Apogee to MH for the feature set. |

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming all Apogee products sound equally good.** The older AD/DA-16, Rosetta series, and original Ensemble were considered subpar by mastering engineers. One community member described the Rosetta 200 as "trash," and others found older units "godawful" compared to Prism and Digidesign. The current generation is a significant improvement.
- **Expecting cross-platform support.** Apogee is heavily macOS-focused. Windows users should look elsewhere.
- **Overlooking the lack of digital I/O on newer models.** The Symphony Studio line lacks BNC, AES, and ADAT connectivity, which limits expansion options and is a dealbreaker for some setups.
- **Dismissing the Symphony because of older Apogee's reputation.** Community consensus is that the Mk II is genuinely excellent, and the perception gap from older products takes time to catch up.
- **Buying Apogee expecting Autotune tracking.** The DSP system only runs Apogee's own plugins. For real-time Autotune monitoring, Apollo remains the only practical option.
