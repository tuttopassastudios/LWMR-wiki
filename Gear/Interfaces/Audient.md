# Audient

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Audient manufactures a range of audio interfaces (iD series) and preamp expanders (ASP series) that are well-regarded for their transparent converters and console-derived preamp design. The community considers Audient a strong value proposition, particularly noting the unique insert send/return loop feature that functions like a "baby Metric Halo ULN-8." While converters measure as completely transparent, the interfaces lack some bells and whistles compared to competitors, and some users report heat and reliability concerns with the ASP880 preamp expander.

## Key Characteristics

- **Transparent, measurement-proven converters** -- described as "completely transparent by all measurements," converters should not be a bottleneck
- **Insert send/return loops on preamps** -- a standout feature allowing outboard processing inline with the preamp, similar to Metric Halo ULN-8 workflow
- **Console-derived preamp design** -- preamps praised by multiple users; some have console heritage from Audient's larger ASP consoles
- **No-frills approach** -- deliberately minimal feature set, which can be an advantage for simplicity
- **Slightly higher roundtrip latency** -- uses standard USB drivers rather than custom drivers like RME, resulting in marginally higher latency
- **ASP880 runs hot** -- multiple reports of the preamp expander getting quite warm, raising longevity concerns
- **Strong price-to-performance ratio** -- hard to beat at the price point for what you get

## Use Cases

- **Home studios needing quality preamps and conversion** -- the iD44/iD48 offer solid all-in-one solutions
- **Studios using outboard gear** -- the insert loops make hardware integration straightforward
- **Budget-conscious upgrades from entry-level** -- competitive step up from basic interfaces
- **Expanding I/O with ASP880** -- 8 preamps with ADAT output for adding channels to an existing interface

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The insert loop is particularly useful for tracking through hardware compressors or EQ without additional routing complexity
- If using the ASP880, ensure adequate ventilation due to heat generation

## Comparable Alternatives

| Interface | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[RME]] | $500-$2,500 | Better drivers and lower latency; higher price |
| [[Focusrite Clarett]] | $400-$900 | Similar tier; clearer preamps per some users |
| SSL Alpha 8 | $500-$700 | Good option if you do not need preamps or a monitor controller |
| [[Metric Halo]] | $2,500+ | The "full version" of the insert-loop workflow |
| [[Universal Audio Apollo]] | $1,000+ | More features but higher cost; consider rackmount models |

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring the heat issue on ASP880** -- rack it with adequate ventilation; multiple users phasing theirs out due to thermal concerns
- **Expecting custom driver performance** -- latency is slightly higher than RME or Apollo; may matter for real-time monitoring
- **Overlooking the insert feature** -- this is the main differentiator vs. competitors at this price; if you do not use outboard, other interfaces may suit better
