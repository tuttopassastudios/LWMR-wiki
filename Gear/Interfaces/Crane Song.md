# Crane Song

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Crane Song, designed by Dave Hill, is known for high-end converters and processing gear, most notably the HEDD (Harmonically Enhanced Digital Device) series. The community views Crane Song converters as intentionally colored rather than transparent -- adding a subtle hype to transients, highs, and lows even with DSP disengaged. This makes them appealing for tracking and production contexts where character is desired, but less suitable for mastering or critical monitoring where transparency is paramount. The HEDD Q was directly compared to the Lynx Aurora(n) in community testing, revealing measurable differences in coloration.

## Key Characteristics

- **Intentionally colored conversion** -- adds gain and hype to transients, highs, and lows even without DSP engaged; not transparent like Lynx
- **HEDD Q includes analog DSP processing** -- triode/pentode tape saturation emulation built into the converter
- **Not recommended for transparent mastering** -- the added color, while pleasant, may not be useful for making accurate mix decisions
- **Level matching is critical for comparison** -- the HEDD adds approximately 0.8 dB of gain, which can make it sound deceptively "better" in casual A/B tests
- **Dave Hill design philosophy** -- deliberate sonic character rather than measurement-chasing transparency
- **New DAC with excellent jitter rejection** -- newer Crane Song DAC measures among the best for jitter rejection, though USB input still degrades performance
- **Monitor controller functionality** -- Crane Song Avocet mentioned as a high-end monitor controller option

## Use Cases

- **Tracking and production** -- where the added character and excitement can enhance recordings
- **Creative AD/DA processing** -- using the HEDD's analog DSP as a color tool
- **Studios wanting character in the conversion stage** -- deliberate alternative to transparent converters
- **Not ideal for mastering** -- community consensus leans toward transparent converters (Lynx, Prism) for mastering

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- When comparing to other converters, level match to below 0.1 dB -- the HEDD's gain boost will bias perception
- The triode/pentode DSP processing is where the HEDD's character really comes alive; experiment with subtle settings on mix bus or individual sources

## Comparable Alternatives

| Converter | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[Lynx Aurora]] | $2,000-$5,000 | Transparent and neutral; preferred for mastering |
| [[Prism Sound]] | $2,000-$10,000 | Slight character but less than Crane Song |
| [[Lavry]] | $1,500-$4,000 | Different philosophy; Dan Lavry was anti-external clocking |
| Burl Audio | $2,000-$5,000 | Transformer-colored; another "character" converter |
| Dangerous Music AD+ | $2,000-$4,000 | Community less favorable toward Dangerous conversion |

## Common Mistakes

- **Not level matching when comparing** -- the ~0.8 dB gain increase on the HEDD will trick your ears into thinking it sounds "better" when it is simply louder
- **Using the HEDD for transparency-critical work** -- if you need accurate monitoring for mastering, the added coloration works against you
- **Confusing "mastering grade" marketing with actual utility** -- the HEDD is sometimes marketed as "mastering grade" but the community consensus is that transparent converters are more useful for mastering

> "I did some testing between the Lynx Aurora(n) and the Crane Song HEDD Q. The Lynx was transparent and essentially inaudible with one pass of conversion. The Crane Song added a bit of gain and a bit of hype to the transients, highs and lows (without DSP engaged). Not transparent like the Lynx. Fascinating." -- Johnny I
