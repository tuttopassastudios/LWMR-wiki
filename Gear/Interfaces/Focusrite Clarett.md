# Focusrite Clarett

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Focusrite Clarett+ series is a mid-range interface line that has earned strong community endorsement as an Apollo-killer at a fraction of the cost. Multiple members independently reported preferring the Clarett+ preamps and conversion over the Universal Audio Apollo x4, describing the sound as clearer and more direct. The Clarett+ 2Pre is bus-powered and highly portable, while the 4Pre model adds dedicated line inputs for outboard gear integration. The series was updated to "Clarett+" with improved conversion that has been very well received.

## Key Characteristics

- **Preamps and conversion preferred over Apollo x4** -- multiple independent users report clearer, more direct sound compared to UA Apollo
- **Bus-powered (USB-C)** -- no external power supply needed; great for mobile recording
- **Dedicated line inputs** -- the 4Pre model has separate line ins at the back, bypassing the preamp circuit entirely (unlike Apollo x4 where line signals must pass through the preamp circuit)
- **Clarett+ update improved conversion** -- the "plus" revision brought updated converters that are highly regarded
- **Conversion competitive with $2,000 DACs** -- one user had the Clarett next to DACs costing $2k and was "not sold on there being any real improvement"
- **No DSP processing** -- unlike Apollo, there is no onboard DSP for plugins, which means adjusting your recording workflow
- **Compact form factor** -- much smaller and lighter than Apollo x4

## Use Cases

- **Apollo replacement for mixers** -- saves significant money while matching or exceeding conversion quality
- **Portable/mobile recording** -- bus-powered design is ideal for on-the-go work
- **Pairing with external preamps** -- dedicated line inputs make outboard integration clean
- **Budget mastering monitoring** -- conversion quality is competitive enough for critical listening
- **Production rooms** -- the Clarett+ was the centerpiece of at least one member's production workflow after leaving Apollo

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Use the dedicated line inputs (rear panel on 4Pre) when connecting external preamps to avoid double-preamp coloring
- If coming from Apollo, budget time to rebuild templates and recording workflow since there is no DSP console equivalent

## Comparable Alternatives

| Interface | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[Universal Audio Apollo]] x4 | $1,500+ | More expensive; DSP is the main advantage |
| [[Focusrite Scarlett]] Gen 4 | $200-$500 | Nearly identical conversion at lower price; fewer features |
| [[Audient]] iD44 | $600-$800 | Similar tier; insert loops are a differentiator |
| [[RME]] Babyface Pro | $800-$1,000 | Better drivers; RME reliability premium |
| [[PreSonus]] Quantum | $800 | Fast, great conversion, more I/O |

## Common Mistakes

- **Not realizing the workflow change from Apollo** -- losing DSP console and high-buffer recording means rebuilding your tracking templates
- **Assuming the original Clarett is the same as Clarett+** -- the plus revision has meaningfully improved conversion
- **Overlooking the Gen 4 Scarlett** -- if you do not need the Clarett's extra line inputs or slightly better chips, the new Scarlett may be sufficient
