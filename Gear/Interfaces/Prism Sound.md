# Prism Sound

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Prism Sound is a high-end British converter manufacturer known for excellent AD/DA conversion with a slightly characterized sound. The community appreciates Prism's transient reproduction, low end, stereo imaging, and neutral-leaning tonality, but frequently criticizes the brand's limited and expensive connectivity options. The Orpheus (FireWire, now aging) and Titan are commonly discussed models, while the Dream 128 represents their flagship at around $10k. Community sentiment is that Prism conversion is excellent but the connectivity limitations and high pricing make it a difficult recommendation compared to alternatives like Lynx Aurora.

## Key Characteristics

- **Excellent transients, low end, and stereo imaging** -- praised for reproduction quality across the frequency spectrum
- **Slightly characterized sound** -- not purely transparent; has a "sound" that users tend to enjoy, described as neutral but with character
- **Connectivity is a major weakness** -- limited modern connection options; Prism charges a premium for connectivity upgrades
- **Orpheus aging out** -- FireWire via adapters leads to latency and instability issues on modern systems
- **Titan and Dream 128 are current models** -- Titan offers updated connectivity; Dream 128 is flagship at ~$10k
- **Respected in mastering circles** -- frequently discussed alongside other high-end converters in mastering contexts
- **High price relative to alternatives** -- at the Prism price point, competitors like Lynx offer similar or better transparency with better connectivity

## Use Cases

- **High-end mastering studios** -- where conversion quality at the AD/DA stage is paramount
- **Studios prioritizing a specific sonic character** -- Prism's slight coloration appeals to some users
- **Electronic music production** -- praised by users recording synths, guitars, and hardware
- **Not ideal for budget-conscious setups** -- the Dream 128 at $10k is hard to justify for home studios

## Comparable Alternatives

| Converter | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[Lynx Aurora]] | $2,000-$5,000 | More transparent; better connectivity options; community preferred |
| [[Lavry]] | $1,500-$4,000 | Competing philosophy on conversion; Dan Lavry was anti-external clocking |
| [[Crane Song]] HEDD Q | $3,000+ | Adds color/character intentionally; not transparent |
| [[Apogee]] Symphony | $3,000+ | Better connectivity and integration |
| [[Metric Halo]] | $2,500+ | Strong conversion with extensive DSP; better feature set |

## Common Mistakes

- **Buying an Orpheus in 2024+** -- FireWire via adapters is asking for trouble; the Orpheus sounds great but is too old for reliable modern use
- **Expecting pure transparency** -- Prism has a character; if you want purely neutral conversion, Lynx may be a better fit
- **Overspending on the Dream 128 for home studio use** -- difficult to justify the cost differential in a non-commercial environment
