# Focusrite

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Focusrite is a British audio interface manufacturer offering a range from entry-level (Scarlett) to professional (Clarett, RedNet) lines. The community regards Focusrite as having dramatically improved their converter and preamp quality in recent generations, with the Gen 4 Scarlett and Clarett+ earning particular praise for punching well above their price class. Multiple members have noted that Focusrite conversion rivals or beats the UA Apollo at a fraction of the cost.

## Key Characteristics

- **Dramatically improved recent generations** -- the Gen 4 Scarlett and Clarett+ represent a significant leap in converter and preamp quality compared to models from 5+ years ago
- **Clarett+ preamps described as clearer than Apollo x4** -- multiple users reported the mic sounding more "direct" on the Clarett vs. "muffled" on the Apollo
- **Gen 4 Scarlett converters practically identical to Clarett** -- according to a Focusrite insider, conversion performance is now very close between the two lines
- **Clarett+ 2Pre is bus-powered via USB-C** -- no external power supply needed, making it highly portable
- **Dedicated line inputs on the Clarett** -- unlike the Apollo x4, you get separate line ins that bypass the preamp circuit entirely
- **Chip choice is not the whole story** -- community consensus is that implementation matters far more than the specific converter chips used (CS5381 in Scarlett vs. CS43198 in Clarett)
- **RedNet line for Dante-based studio networking** -- professional tier for larger installations

## Use Cases

- **Budget-conscious mixing rigs** -- the Clarett+ offers competitive conversion at roughly half the cost of an Apollo x4
- **Mobile/portable recording** -- bus-powered Clarett+ 2Pre is compact and requires no outlet
- **Writing/production rigs** -- the Focusrite 1820 praised as a solid workhorse for writing setups with 8 combo jacks
- **Stepping up from entry-level** -- Gen 4 Scarlett provides remarkable performance for around $200
- **Pairing with external preamps** -- the Clarett's dedicated line inputs make integrating outboard gear cleaner

## Comparable Alternatives

| Interface | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[Universal Audio Apollo]] | $1,000-$3,500 | More expensive; DSP processing is the main draw, but conversion may not be better |
| [[RME]] | $500-$2,500 | Better drivers and lower latency; community gold standard for reliability |
| [[Audient]] | $300-$1,200 | Similar price class; praised for insert send/return loops |
| [[PreSonus]] | $300-$800 | Quantum series competitive on speed and conversion |
| SSL Alpha 8 | $500-$700 | Good if you do not need preamps and already have a monitor controller |

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming chip specs determine sound quality** -- the same converter chip can sound wildly different depending on implementation; one member noted two DACs with identical chipsets where one was "fantastic" and the other "complete dogshit unlistenable"
- **Overlooking the Gen 4 Scarlett** -- many assume you must buy the Clarett for quality conversion, but the newest Scarlett is remarkably close
- **Not committing UAD DSP plugins before switching** -- if migrating from Apollo, make sure to print any DSP-dependent plugin chains first
