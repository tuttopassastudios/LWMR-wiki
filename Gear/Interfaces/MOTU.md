# MOTU

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> MOTU (Mark of the Unicorn) makes a range of audio interfaces known for exceptional reliability, long product lifecycles, and solid driver support. The community repeatedly praises MOTU interfaces -- particularly the 16A -- as rock-solid workhorses that "just work." The 16A offers 16 channels of I/O in 1U with AVB networking capability. MOTU is frequently recommended alongside RME as the gold standard for reliability and driver stability, and the brand has a strong track record of not obsoleting older hardware.

## Key Characteristics

- **Legendary reliability** -- described as "built like fucking tanks" with units working perfectly after years of heavy use
- **No driver hassles** -- plug-and-play experience with no OS limitations or driver conflicts; consistently praised for stability
- **Web-based control software** -- modern, easy-to-use browser-based mixer/routing interface
- **16A: 16 channels in 1U** -- great converter density with 1/4" connections and AVB networking
- **AVB networking support** -- allows connecting multiple MOTU units or expanding systems over ethernet
- **Long product lifecycle** -- MOTU actively supports older products and avoids planned obsolescence; old MTP-AVs still in use at Berklee
- **Ultralite Mk5** -- compact form factor suitable for both desktop and live use
- **Great sound quality** -- converters sound excellent and are considered transparent at this price point

## Use Cases

- **Primary studio interface** -- the 16A as a reliable, set-it-and-forget-it converter/interface
- **Live sound / dual-duty** -- Ultralite Mk5 works well as both a home desktop interface and live interface for running stereo pairs to FOH
- **High I/O needs on a budget** -- two 16As ($3,000 total) provide 32 channels of clean conversion
- **AVB-networked studios** -- connect multiple MOTU units for scalable I/O
- **Standalone converter mode** -- 16A can run in standalone mode to supplement other interfaces via ADAT/AVB

## Comparable Alternatives

| Interface | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[RME]] | $500-$2,500 | Similar reliability ethos; custom drivers with lower latency |
| [[Antelope Audio]] Orion 32 | $2,000-$4,000 | More channels in 1U but questionable reliability |
| [[Universal Audio Apollo]] x16 | $3,500+ | DB25 connectors; DSP processing; higher cost |
| [[Lynx Aurora]] | $2,000-$5,000 | Higher-end conversion; less I/O flexibility |
| [[Audient]] iD44 | $600-$800 | Fewer channels; insert loops are a differentiator |

## Common Mistakes

- **Overlooking MOTU for its lack of "glamour"** -- MOTU does not have the marketing flash of UA or the audiophile cachet of Lynx, but the reliability and value are hard to beat
- **Assuming you need to upgrade** -- the 16A and similar units hold their value and performance over many years; resist upgrade fever
- **Not exploring AVB networking** -- the ability to chain units is a major advantage for growing studios
