# Antelope Audio

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Antelope Audio makes high-channel-count interfaces and converters including the Orion 32 and Goliath HD. The community is deeply divided on Antelope: the hardware itself sounds good and offers tremendous I/O density (32 channels in 1U), but the brand is dogged by persistent reports of poor build quality, unreliable software/driver support, and questionable long-term product support. Some notable professionals (Mike Dean among them) swear by Antelope, while others in the community would "avoid it like the plague."

## Key Characteristics

- **High channel density** -- the Orion 32 delivers 32 channels of I/O in a single rack unit with DB25 connectors
- **Converters sound transparent by modern standards** -- community consensus is converters at this tier all sound effectively the same; shop by features and compatibility
- **Controversial build quality** -- multiple members report hardware feeling cheaply built for the price
- **Software and driver support widely criticized** -- described as "half-baked driver implementations" with horror stories about updates and OS compatibility
- **Older products may lose software support** -- a recurring concern that Antelope abandons older hardware when new products launch
- **Orion 32 praised for outboard integration** -- having all I/O on dedicated inserts makes integrating hardware in mixes very efficient
- **Compatible with HD Native** -- Orion 32HD works with Pro Tools HD Native Thunderbolt for sample-accurate roundtrips

## Use Cases

- **High I/O studios needing dense converter counts** -- 32 channels in 1U is hard to beat for rack space efficiency
- **Pro Tools HD Native setups** -- the Orion 32HD integrates well with Digilink systems
- **Studios with extensive outboard** -- dedicated inserts via patchbay make hardware integration seamless
- **Not recommended for reliability-critical situations** -- driver and support issues make it a risky choice for mission-critical workflows

## Comparable Alternatives

| Interface | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[Lynx Aurora]] | $2,000-$5,000 | Significantly better long-term support and reliability; community preferred |
| [[MOTU]] 16A | $1,500 | Fewer channels but rock-solid reliability and drivers |
| [[RME]] | $1,000-$3,000 | Gold standard for drivers; lower channel counts per unit |
| [[Universal Audio Apollo]] x16 | $3,500+ | DB25 connectors; can pair with standalone converters for expansion |
| [[Apogee]] Symphony | $3,000+ | Premium conversion with excellent Pro Tools integration |

## Common Mistakes

- **Buying based on specs alone** -- the I/O density and price look appealing on paper, but factor in the cost of potential downtime from software issues
- **Assuming older Antelope units will work with new OS** -- compatibility with newer macOS versions is not guaranteed, and some users have had to explore MADI workarounds to keep older units functional
- **Not testing thoroughly before committing** -- given the divided opinions, try to demo or borrow before purchasing
