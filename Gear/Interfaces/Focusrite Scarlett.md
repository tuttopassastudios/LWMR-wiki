# Focusrite Scarlett

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Focusrite Scarlett series is the entry-level to mid-range line that has become one of the most widely used interfaces in home studios. The Gen 4 revision represents a dramatic leap in quality, with conversion described as "practically identical" to the Focusrite Clarett by a Focusrite insider. At around $200 for 192kHz/24-bit capability, the Gen 4 Scarlett offers remarkable value and is frequently recommended as a no-brainer for anyone starting out or running a budget mixing rig.

## Key Characteristics

- **Gen 4 conversion nearly identical to Clarett** -- confirmed by a Focusrite contact; the gap between product tiers has narrowed significantly
- **192kHz / 24-bit for ~$200** -- extremely hard to beat on price-to-performance
- **New features not available on Clarett** -- Gen 4 Scarlett includes functionality updates that the Clarett line has not yet received
- **Scarlett 18i20 popular for larger home setups** -- provides 18 inputs and 20 outputs with ADAT expansion
- **Adequate for serious work** -- used by community members alongside monitor controllers, multiple speaker pairs, and outboard gear
- **Not the last word in preamps** -- while improved, dedicated external preamps will still offer a meaningful step up
- **Focusrite software integration** -- routing and monitor control possible through Focusrite Control software, including multiple speaker set switching

## Use Cases

- **First serious interface** -- the default recommendation for anyone entering audio production
- **Budget mixing rigs** -- conversion quality no longer holds back the work at this price point
- **Mobile/secondary rigs** -- members have considered switching from SSL interfaces to Gen 4 Scarlett for mobile setups
- **Pairing with Avantone MixCubes or second monitors** -- the 18i20 has enough outputs to run multiple speaker pairs via software routing

## Comparable Alternatives

| Interface | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[Focusrite Clarett]] | $400-$900 | Slightly better chips on paper; dedicated line inputs; bus-powered |
| [[Audient]] iD series | $200-$500 | Console-derived preamps; insert loops |
| [[PreSonus]] Studio series | $200-$500 | Similar tier; Studio One DAW included |
| SSL 2/2+ | $250-$350 | SSL preamp character; limited I/O |
| [[MOTU]] M-series | $200-$400 | Great metering; solid conversion |

## Common Mistakes

- **Adding a cheap analog monitor controller** -- anything placed between the Scarlett and your monitors will likely degrade the signal; use software monitoring or invest in a quality controller
- **Not exploring software routing** -- the Scarlett 18i20 can switch between multiple monitor pairs using Focusrite Control, potentially eliminating the need for a hardware monitor controller
- **Dismissing the Scarlett as "entry-level"** -- the Gen 4 converters compete with interfaces costing several times more
