# Lavry

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Lavry Engineering, founded by Dan Lavry, produces high-end converters that were once considered among the finest available. The DA-10 DAC is the most commonly discussed model in the community, valued as a meaningful step up from prosumer converters like MOTU. Dan Lavry was notably anti-external clocking, believing internal clocks were superior -- a position the community largely agrees with. While Lavry converters remain well-regarded, they are aging designs, and the community consensus is that money would be better spent on a newer converter design rather than trying to improve a Lavry with an external clock.

## Key Characteristics

- **DA-10 is a notable step up from prosumer converters** -- described as a "huge step up from the new MOTU" for DA monitoring
- **Dan Lavry was anti-external clocking** -- the designer believed internal clocks perform better, and the community generally supports this view
- **Aging designs** -- while still sounding good, Lavry converters are not the cutting edge they once were
- **Better to upgrade converter than add a clock** -- community advice is that buying a newer converter is more worthwhile than adding an external master clock to improve a Lavry
- **TOSLINK connection considered weakest** -- S/PDIF coax preferred over TOSLINK for digital input; use short, quality cables
- **Respected heritage** -- Dan Lavry's converter designs influenced the industry and the brand carries significant credibility

## Use Cases

- **Dedicated DA monitoring** -- the DA-10 used as a standalone DAC for critical listening
- **Budget high-end monitoring** -- older Lavry units available used at reasonable prices
- **S/PDIF-connected DAC** -- pairs with interfaces via coax S/PDIF for dedicated monitoring chain

## Comparable Alternatives

| Converter | Price Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[Lynx Aurora]] Hilo | $2,000-$3,000 | Modern design; better feature set; community top pick |
| [[Prism Sound]] | $2,000-$10,000 | Character-rich conversion with modern connectivity |
| [[Crane Song]] HEDD Q | $3,000+ | Colored conversion; built-in DSP |
| [[RME]] ADI-2 DAC | $800-$1,200 | Modern; excellent measurements; parametric EQ for headphones |
| Grace Design m900 | $500 | Budget high-quality DAC/headphone amp |

## Common Mistakes

- **Adding an external master clock to improve a Lavry** -- the money is better spent on a newer converter design entirely
- **Using TOSLINK when coax S/PDIF is available** -- TOSLINK is generally considered the weakest digital connection option
- **Expecting current-generation performance** -- Lavry designs, while still good, have been surpassed by modern competitors
