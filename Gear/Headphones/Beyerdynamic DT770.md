# Beyerdynamic DT770

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Beyerdynamic DT770 is a closed-back studio headphone widely used for tracking. Praised for comfort and durability, they are a common alternative to the [[Audio-Technica ATH-M50x]]. Sound quality opinions range from "fine" to "dogshit" -- they are viewed as purely functional tracking cans rather than mixing references.

## Key Characteristics

- Closed-back design with good isolation
- Super comfortable for long sessions
- Scooped frequency response -- lacks midrange definition
- Highly serviceable (headband, pads, drivers all replaceable)
- Available in 80 and 250 ohm versions
- Benefit significantly from the dedicated Beyerdynamic headphone amp (A20)
- Sound "congested and dull" with most modern low-impedance headphone outputs

## Use Cases

- Studio tracking headphones (vocals, overdubs)
- Artist monitoring during recording
- Travel tracking rig

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- 80 ohm version is easier to drive and recommended for most use
- The Beyerdynamic A20 headphone amp transforms their sound
- The newer DT770 Pro X has detachable cable and drivers from the 700 Pro X

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-M50x]] | ~$150 | More midrange, harsher highs |
| Rode NTH-100 | ~$150 | Good quality, less mechanical noise |
| [[Beyerdynamic DT880]] | ~$200 | Semi-open, flatter response |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting them to work well as mixing headphones
- Using 250 ohm version with a weak headphone output
- Not considering the newer DT770 Pro X with improved drivers

> "The DT770s are super super comfortable but they don't sound particularly great... they're just tracking cans, as long as the artist gets their vibe right everything's OK."

> "The DT770 really benefit from the Beyer headphone amps. Allegedly they were originally designed with a pretty high output impedance from the headphone amp... the sound is somewhat congested and dull otherwise."
