# Audio-Technica ATH-M50x

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is one of the most common studio tracking headphones. Praised for their full, direct sound and affordability, they are a workhorse in recording studios. However, they have a notable high-mid peak that some artists find harsh, and their folding design can feel fragile.

## Key Characteristics

- Closed-back design with good isolation for tracking
- Spiky presence region around 4-6k that can feel harsh on some listeners
- Full low end and direct sound signature
- Folding/swiveling design that can "discombobulate itself in 0.0003s in an artist's hands" (Bryan DiMaio)
- High mechanical noise from plastic construction as they age

## Use Cases

- Studio tracking headphones (vocals, overdubs)
- Budget reference headphones for home studios
- Travel headphones for production on the go

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Consider notching the cue feed around 4-6k for artists who find them harsh
- Some engineers keep 5+ pairs as standard tracking cans
- Garfield Softies ear pads can help with comfort and reduce some mechanical noise

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Beyerdynamic DT770]] | ~$150 | More comfortable, less midrange definition |
| Rode NTH-100 | ~$150 | Less mechanical noise, comfortable |
| Audio-Technica ATH-M40x | ~$100 | Cheaper, similar issues with build |
| [[Beyerdynamic DT770]] Pro X | ~$180 | Detachable cable, 700 Pro X drivers |

## Common Mistakes

- Using them as mixing headphones without understanding their colored frequency response
- Not having an alternative pair for artists who find the high-mid peak fatiguing
- Forgetting that they sound scooped compared to flatter references
