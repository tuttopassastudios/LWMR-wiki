# Sennheiser HD650

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Sennheiser HD650 (and its Drop/Massdrop equivalent, the HD6XX at ~$200) is widely regarded as one of the best value open-back headphones for mixing and critical listening. Multiple community members consider it their go-to, and professional mixer Zakk Cervini has been spotted using them on planes.

## Key Characteristics

- Open-back dynamic driver design
- Natural, well-balanced midrange
- The Drop HD6XX is the same headphone at a lower price (~$200)
- 300 ohm impedance -- benefits from a decent headphone amp
- Better translation than headphones costing several times more, per several members

## Use Cases

- Mixing and production reference
- Portable mixing (open-back, so not for tracking)
- Upgrade from budget closed-back headphones

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Works well with most audio interfaces but benefits from a quality headphone amp
- Some users pair with corrective EQ for personal preference

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Sennheiser HD600]] | ~$250-300 | Very similar, slightly different voicing |
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-R70x]] | ~$350 | Similar neutral approach, lighter |
| [[Audeze LCD-X]] | ~$1000+ | More low end, problematic upper mids |
| Hifiman Sundara | ~$300 | Planar magnetic alternative |

## Common Mistakes

- Paying full retail when the HD6XX is the same headphone for ~$200
- Using them for tracking (open-back = bleed)
- Not giving them a proper headphone amp
