# Beyerdynamic DT880

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Beyerdynamic DT880 is a semi-open headphone that, when paired with the dedicated Beyerdynamic headphone amp, is surprisingly resolving and relatively flat. Without the proper amp, they sound anemic. The 600 ohm version is recommended over the lower impedance models.

## Key Characteristics

- Semi-open back design
- Flatter frequency response than the DT770 and DT990
- Requires dedicated Beyerdynamic headphone amp (100 ohm output impedance) to shine
- The 600 ohm version is preferred for mixing; 770 and 990 "have essentially no mids"
- Very comfortable for long sessions
- Takes corrective EQ well

## Use Cases

- Mixing and production reference (with dedicated amp)
- Travel mixing rig
- Budget alternative to more expensive planar magnetics

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Sennheiser HD650]] / HD6XX | ~$200-350 | More universally recommended |
| [[Beyerdynamic DT770]] | ~$150 | Closed-back, tracking focused |
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-R70x]] | ~$350 | Open-back, very light |

## Common Mistakes

- Using without the Beyerdynamic headphone amp -- "like a different headphone" with it
- Getting the lower impedance versions instead of the 600 ohm
- Expecting them to translate well without learning their specific character
