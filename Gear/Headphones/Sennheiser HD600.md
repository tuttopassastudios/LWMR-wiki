# Sennheiser HD600

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Sennheiser HD600 is an open-back dynamic headphone valued for its natural midrange reproduction. A longtime favorite alongside the [[Sennheiser HD650]], it serves as a reliable mixing reference for engineers who know its characteristics.

## Key Characteristics

- Open-back dynamic driver design
- Very natural sounding midrange, helpful for mixing
- 300 ohm impedance -- needs a decent amp
- Headband comfort can be an issue; aftermarket padding (Dekoni Nuggets) recommended
- Lighter than most Beyerdynamic and Audeze options

## Use Cases

- Mixing reference headphones
- Checking binaural content
- General critical listening

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Replace headband padding with Dekoni Nuggets for improved comfort
- Works well as a secondary reference alongside monitors

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Sennheiser HD650]] / HD6XX | ~$200-350 | Very similar, slightly warmer |
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-R70x]] | ~$350 | Described as "a better HD600" |
| [[Beyerdynamic DT880]] | ~$200 | Semi-open alternative |

## Common Mistakes

- Confusing with the HD650 -- they are different headphones with different voicing
- Not investing in a proper headphone amp for the 300 ohm impedance
