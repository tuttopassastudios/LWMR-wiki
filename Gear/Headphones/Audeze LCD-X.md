# Audeze LCD-X

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Audeze LCD-X is a planar magnetic open-back headphone popular among mix engineers for its exceptional low end and low-mid response. The 2021 revision improved the frequency response somewhat, but the model retains a notable dip around 2.5k-4k that requires corrective EQ for reliable mixing. Weight and build quality remain concerns.

## Key Characteristics

- Open-back planar magnetic design
- Excellent low end extension and low-mid clarity
- Significant dip at 2.5k-4k (approximately 13 dB at 4kHz per measurements)
- Heavy weight -- some users find they do not clamp well, feeling like "two small speakers hanging off the sides of my head"
- Inconsistent build quality for the price point
- Benefits greatly from corrective EQ (Sonarworks or similar)

## Use Cases

- Mixing reference for low end and low-mid decisions
- Critical listening (with EQ correction)
- Checking compression behavior -- "first headphones I can hear compression clearly on" (shaunobi)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Throw corrective EQ on the output of your interface (e.g., RME parametric EQ)
- Sonarworks correction profile helps even out the upper-mid dip
- The Manny Marroquin signature model is essentially the LCD-X with the 3k dip filled in and lighter weight

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Audeze MM-500 | ~$1700 | More "correct" upper midrange, similar character |
| [[Sennheiser HD650]] / HD6XX | ~$200-350 | Better translation overall per some users |
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-R70x]] | ~$350 | Loved for mixing, less low end |
| HEDDphone | ~$1800 | Less hyped midrange |

## Common Mistakes

- Mixing without corrective EQ and ending up with too much energy in the 2-4k range
- Expecting the build quality to match the price
- Not testing fit before buying -- the weight and clamp force are divisive
