# Audio-Technica ATH-R70x

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Audio-Technica ATH-R70x is an open-back reference headphone praised for its neutral character and featherlight weight. Described as having "all the good things about Beyers and none of the bad," it is gaining fans among engineers looking for transparent mixing headphones. The 470 ohm impedance is high but manageable with most interfaces.

## Key Characteristics

- Open-back dynamic driver design
- Extremely lightweight
- 470 ohm impedance -- high but manageable (check sensitivity spec, not just impedance)
- Neutral midrange -- "I can hear the music and not the headphones" (Edward Rivera)
- Low end is not as strong as planar magnetics
- Some high-end dips noted

## Use Cases

- Mixing reference headphones
- Alternative to [[Sennheiser HD600]] with lighter weight
- Production and critical listening

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Pair with corrective EQ (Oratory presets or Sonarworks) to tighten up the bass
- CanOpener plugin recommended alongside EQ correction

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Sennheiser HD600]] | ~$300 | Similar neutral character, heavier |
| [[Sennheiser HD650]] / HD6XX | ~$200-350 | Warmer low end |
| [[Audeze LCD-X]] | ~$1000+ | More low end, heavier, upper-mid issues |
| Beyerdynamic DT900 Pro X | ~$250 | Comfortable, open-back |

## Common Mistakes

- Worrying about the 470 ohm impedance without checking sensitivity -- most interfaces drive them fine
- Expecting heavy bass response from an open-back dynamic
