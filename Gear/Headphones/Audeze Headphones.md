# Audeze Headphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Audeze is a planar magnetic headphone manufacturer frequently discussed in the community. Their models including the [[Audeze LCD-X]], MM-500, and the Manny Marroquin signature model are popular among mix engineers. Opinions on Audeze are polarized -- the sound quality is widely praised but build quality and QC concerns are persistent.

## Key Characteristics

- **Planar magnetic drivers** -- deliver exceptional low end and low-mid response
- Known dip in the 2.5k-4k range on several models, which some find problematic for mixing upper midrange content
- Audeze designs headphones to be "flat" like speakers, but this means they lack the presence peak needed to compensate for missing pinna gain, often requiring corrective EQ
- Heavy weight is a common complaint, though the Manny model is approximately 130g lighter than the 2021 LCD-X
- Build quality is inconsistent for the price point -- reports of drivers falling off headbands, screws coming loose

## Use Cases

- Mixing and critical listening (with corrective EQ or Sonarworks)
- Checking low end and low-mid content
- Reference headphones for engineers who have learned their particular response curve

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Pair with corrective EQ (Sonarworks, Oratory presets, or RME parametric EQ) to address the upper midrange dip
- Some users report the MM-500 sounds "grey" without a quality DAC/headphone amp
- The Manny model addresses the 3k dip found in the LCD-X while being lighter

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Sennheiser HD650]] | ~$200-350 | Better translation per some members; less low end |
| [[Sennheiser HD600]] | ~$250-350 | Natural midrange, lighter weight |
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-R70x]] | ~$350 | Lighter, open-back, less low end |
| Neumann NDH 30 | ~$500 | Dynamic drivers, low THD |
| Focal (various) | $500+ | Higher end alternative |
| HEDDphone | ~$1800 | AMT drivers, less hyped midrange |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying Audeze headphones without trying them first -- HRTF varies significantly between individuals
- Using them without corrective EQ and wondering why upper midrange decisions do not translate
- Expecting robust build quality at the price point -- handle with care, especially removing them
- Not having a headphone amp with sufficient quality to drive planar magnetics properly

> [!quote] Eric Martin
> "TLDR Audeze headphones are crap, don't buy, customer service is also crap. I have a pair of Audeze LCD-X headphones that I wanted to measure because they have a tilt to them, like one driver is louder... 78db L 81/82db R. Even if I'm off a db, that's still enough to drive a mixer nuts."

> [!quote] Rob Domos
> "The build quality on Audezes is shockingly inconsistent for something so high quality and expensive in all other ways. I've literally had the driver fall off the headband because the screws came loose twice now."

> [!quote] Josh Bowman (on MM-500)
> "I had a driver issue (distortion with bass in one side) in my MM-500s and Audeze fixed/replaced them under warranty for free."
