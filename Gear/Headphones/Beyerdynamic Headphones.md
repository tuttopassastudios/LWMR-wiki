# Beyerdynamic Headphones

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Beyerdynamic is a German headphone manufacturer known for exceptionally comfortable studio headphones. Their DT series (770, 880, 990, 900 Pro X) are widely used in studios for tracking and some mixing. The brand is recommended as an excellent starting point for aspiring engineers, though some members find their tuning "weird."

## Key Characteristics

- Known for superior comfort, especially for long sessions
- Highly serviceable -- headband, pads, and even drivers can be replaced
- Available in multiple impedance options (80, 250, 600 ohm)
- Originally designed for higher output impedance headphone amps; can sound congested with modern low-impedance outputs
- The Beyerdynamic A20 headphone amp significantly improves their performance

## Use Cases

- Studio tracking headphones (especially [[Beyerdynamic DT770]])
- Mixing reference (especially [[Beyerdynamic DT880]] with dedicated amp)
- Travel and production work
- Comfort-priority applications for engineers with long sessions

## Comparable Alternatives

| Headphone | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-M50x]] | ~$150 | More midrange presence, less comfortable |
| [[Sennheiser HD600]] | ~$300 | Better midrange accuracy, open-back |
| [[Audio-Technica ATH-R70x]] | ~$350 | Lighter, open-back |
| Austrian Audio Hi-X series | ~$300-400 | Newer contender |

## Common Mistakes

- Using high-impedance models (250/600 ohm) with weak headphone outputs
- Skipping the dedicated Beyerdynamic headphone amp, which transforms the sound
- Assuming all DT models sound the same -- the 770, 880, and 990 have very different frequency responses
