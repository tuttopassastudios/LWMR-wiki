# Mic Stands

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Mic stands are discussed in the community primarily in the context of travel rigs, vibration isolation, and studio setup. Heavy, stable stands are preferred for studio use to minimize rumble pickup (especially with ribbon mics), while lightweight/portable options are valued for travel sessions. The most common advice is to invest in quality stands that hold position reliably -- a mic stand that drifts during a take is a session killer.

## Key Characteristics

- Heavy stands reduce vibration transmission to the microphone
- Stable boom arms that hold position without drifting are essential
- K&M and Atlas are commonly referenced professional brands
- Portable/travel stands exist but compromise on stability
- A blanket under the mic stand base can reduce floor vibration for ribbon mics
- Boom stands doubling as blanket/gobo holders for acoustic treatment in tracking

## Use Cases

- Studio vocal recording (heavy, stable stand preferred)
- Travel recording rigs (lightweight, fits in a Pelican case)
- Drum overhead placement (tall boom stands)
- Improvised acoustic treatment (horizontal boom with blankets draped over)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- For ribbon mics, use a heavy stand or place a blanket under the base to reduce rumble
- Turn a boom stand horizontal to create a T-shape for draping blankets as improvised gobos
- For travel, a compact stand that fits in a checked Pelican case alongside interface and mics

## Comparable Alternatives

| Stand Type | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| K&M Boom Stands | ~$50-150 | Industry standard |
| Atlas Sound | ~$80-200 | Heavy duty, professional |
| On-Stage Stands | ~$30-60 | Budget option |
| Triad-Orbit | ~$200-500 | Premium, modular system |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying cheap stands that drift under the weight of heavy microphones
- Forgetting about floor vibration when using ribbon mics on lightweight stands
- Not bringing a mic stand in the travel rig -- some engineers pack one in a Pelican case
