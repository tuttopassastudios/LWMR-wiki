# Shock Mount

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Shock mounts isolate microphones from stand-borne vibrations and are particularly important for ribbon and large-diaphragm condenser mics. The community debates whether shock mounts are always necessary -- some engineers never use them in studio contexts, preferring rigid mic clips like the Enhanced Audio M600 that couple the mic firmly to the stand. Rycote and Audio-Technica make popular universal options. Proprietary mounts (like Microtech Gefell's at $350 each) are a common pain point.

## Key Characteristics

- Elastic suspension isolates the mic from stand vibrations
- Essential for ribbon mics due to their sensitivity to rumble
- Less critical in well-controlled studio environments with heavy stands
- Proprietary shock mounts for specific mics can be extremely expensive
- Universal shock mounts (Audio-Technica, Rycote) work for many mics
- The Enhanced Audio M600 rigid mount is an alternative philosophy -- couple the mic firmly rather than isolate

## Use Cases

- Ribbon mic recording (essential for rumble isolation)
- Vocal sessions where the artist moves or the floor transmits vibration
- Live recording environments with foot traffic
- Any session with lightweight mic stands prone to vibration

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Use shock mounts with ribbon mics as a default
- In a well-controlled studio with heavy stands, rigid clips can be preferable
- Board tape can make serviceable custom mic clips in a pinch

## Comparable Alternatives

| Mount | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rycote InVision | ~$60-100 | Popular universal option |
| Audio-Technica AT8449 | ~$30 | Budget universal mount |
| Enhanced Audio M600 | ~$80 | Rigid coupling philosophy |
| Proprietary OEM Mounts | $50-350 | Mic-specific, often expensive |

## Common Mistakes

- Spending $350 on a proprietary shock mount when a universal one fits
- Always defaulting to a shock mount when a rigid clip might serve better
- Not using a shock mount with ribbon mics -- they are very susceptible to low-frequency rumble
- Ignoring the mic stand as the root cause of vibration problems
