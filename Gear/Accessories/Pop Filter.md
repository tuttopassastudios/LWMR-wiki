# Pop Filter

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Pop filters are a surprisingly debated accessory in the community. While some dismiss them as interchangeable, experienced engineers note meaningful sonic differences between metal and nylon types. Metal pop filters can introduce sibilant resonances with certain singers, while double-nylon types can sound slightly muted. The pencil-taped-to-the-mic trick remains a valid alternative. Recommended brands include K&M (affordable, durable), Rycote, JZ, Hakan, Neumann, and the high-end Pauly.

## Key Characteristics

- Metal mesh filters: brighter, can introduce sibilant resonances on some voices
- Nylon/fabric filters: slightly darker, better at stopping plosives, can sound muffled
- The Pauly pop filter is considered the most effective at removing pops while retaining high end
- K&M pop filters are cheap, durable, and easily replaced
- Pop filters do affect the sound, despite common claims otherwise
- The pencil-on-the-mic trick works in a pinch for stubborn plosives

## Use Cases

- Vocal recording to prevent plosive artifacts
- Ribbon mic recording (pops can damage ribbons -- a pop filter is essential)
- Maintaining consistent mic distance for vocalists who move

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Distance from the mic matters -- too close can affect tonality, too far reduces effectiveness
- Swap between metal and nylon types depending on the singer and mic combination
- Keep pop filters clean so they do not gross out the artist
- In a pinch, a thin stretched sock or nylons over a coat hanger is serviceable

## Comparable Alternatives

| Pop Filter | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| K&M Pop Filter | ~$15 | Cheap, durable, easily replaced |
| Rycote Pop Filter | ~$60 | Quality option |
| JZ Pop Filter | ~$50 | Popular brand |
| Hakan P110 | ~$100 | High quality, gooseneck mount |
| Neumann Pop Filter | ~$80 | Well-regarded |
| Pauly Superscreen | ~$300 | Best plosive rejection, retains HF |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming all pop filters sound the same -- they measurably affect the recording
- Sticking with one type for every session instead of swapping based on the singer
- Spending $300 on a Pauly when starting out -- it is not a bottleneck at that stage
- Not considering the pencil trick when a specific singer has extreme plosive issues

> "Pop filters VERY much have a sound. Not necessarily better or worse, but they do absolutely affect the recording and I will swap them out depending. The metal ones can sometimes get a bit essy, and the double nylon ones can sometimes get a bit muted."

> "I like K&M pop filters. Cheap to replace, and are very resistant to being used a lot. I don't think pop filters have a sound if setup correctly."

> [!quote] BatMeckley
> "This whole thread is also just pertinent as the boy band I was just working on -- we ended up having to swap out the pop filters for one of the singers and tape a pencil to the mic to get the plosives under control."
