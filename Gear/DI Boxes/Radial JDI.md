# Radial JDI

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Radial JDI is a passive DI box built around a Jensen transformer, commonly recommended for clean, transparent DI duties. It is frequently mentioned alongside a preamp setup for recording synths, keyboards, and bass. Available in rack-mount multi-channel configurations as well as single-channel units.

## Key Characteristics

- Passive design with Jensen transformer
- No phantom power required
- Clean and transparent tone
- Available in rack-mount multi-channel formats
- Thru output for signal splitting
- Well-suited for pairing with high-quality preamps

## Use Cases

- Bass and guitar DI recording with a quality preamp
- Synth and keyboard recording in rack-mount configuration
- Pairing with a Neve 5211 or similar preamp for studio recording
- Signal splitting for simultaneous DI + amp recording

## Comparable Alternatives

| DI Box | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Radial J48]] | ~$200 | Active, better with pedals |
| [[Neve RNDI]] | ~$270 | Active, wider fidelity |
| Countryman Type 85 | ~$200 | Active classic |
| [[Little Labs]] Redeye | ~$400 | DI + reamp combo |

## Common Mistakes

- Using a passive DI like the JDI with passive pickups into a passive splitter -- the signal will be weak
- Not considering the [[Radial J48]] when pedals are in the signal chain

> "I could get a deal on a Neve 5211 and just run a Radial JDI for my guitars, Rhodes, and synths. A DI box and 2 channels would be sick because I could record guitar DI and a mic'd amp at the same time using the JDI thru feature."
