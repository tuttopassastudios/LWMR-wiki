# Little Labs

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Little Labs, founded by Jonathan Little (a former engineer at Conway Studios), produces purpose-built studio tools that are widely respected for their build quality and thoughtful design. The Redeye is the most referenced product -- a combined DI and reamp box. The PCP (Instrument Cable Extender/Splitter) is praised for solving signal splitting problems every session. Members consistently describe Little Labs gear as "clearly designed by someone who worked in a real studio."

## Key Characteristics

- Redeye: combined DI and reamp box in one unit
- PCP: instrument splitter that preserves pickup impedance for pedals (especially fuzzes)
- STD (Signal Transfer Device): versatile impedance matching tool
- Newer 3D version of the Redeye is active and less fiddly than the original
- Built like a tank -- safe to buy used
- Available in 500 series format

## Use Cases

- Reamping bass guitar through tube DIs
- Splitting instrument signals (dry DI + wet pedalboard simultaneously)
- Interfacing guitar pedals for mixing
- General DI duties in professional studios

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The PCP should be placed before fuzz pedals -- fuzzes need to "see" the pickup directly
- The 3D active Redeye is recommended over the original passive version for ease of use
- Any passive pickup into a passive splitter will sound weak -- use the PCP or an active solution

## Comparable Alternatives

| Product | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Radial DI]] EXTC | ~$250 | Pedal interface with mix knob |
| [[Radial J48]] | ~$200 | Active DI only, no reamp |
| Orchid Amp Interface | ~$200 | UK-made alternative |
| DIY RE Reamp Kit | ~$50 | Simplest starter DIY kit |

## Common Mistakes

- Overlooking Little Labs in favor of Radial when they serve the same price point
- Not getting the PCP for signal splitting -- it solves problems every session once you have one
- Buying a passive splitter for passive pickups without understanding impedance loading

> [!quote] BatMeckley
> "Jonathan Little from Little Labs was an engineer at Conway and all his gear is 'clearly a guy at a real working studio constantly needed this thing and it doesn't exist so he used his genius brain to make it' -- just absolutely useful, well-built, problem-solving tools."
