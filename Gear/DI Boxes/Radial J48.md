# Radial J48

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Radial J48 is an active DI box that is a common workhorse choice for guitar, bass, and keyboard recording. It is the active counterpart to the passive [[Radial JDI]], and is recommended over passive DIs when pedals are in the signal chain. Members describe it as a safe, quality choice that "never does you wrong," though some prefer the [[Neve RNDI]] for its more refined sound.

## Key Characteristics

- Active DI powered by phantom power
- Thru output for splitting signal (e.g., DI + pedalboard simultaneously)
- Better impedance matching with pedals than passive DIs
- Reliable, no-nonsense build quality
- Good compromise between cheap DIs and high-end options

## Use Cases

- Guitar and bass DI recording
- Splitting signal between clean DI and pedalboard/amp
- Rhodes and synth recording
- Live and studio applications

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Use the J48 instead of passive DIs when pedals are in the signal chain before the DI
- The thru output enables simultaneous DI + mic'd amp recording

## Comparable Alternatives

| DI Box | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Neve RNDI]] | ~$270 | More refined, wider fidelity |
| [[Radial JDI]] | ~$200 | Passive, Jensen transformer |
| Radial Pro48 | ~$100 | Budget active option |
| Countryman Type 85 | ~$200 | Classic active alternative |
| [[Little Labs]] PCP | ~$400 | Splitter with impedance preservation |

## Common Mistakes

- Using a passive DI with pedals in the chain -- bassists report pedals not responding the same way
- Not considering the RNDI as an upgrade if more fidelity is needed
