# Cloudlifter

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Cloudlifter is a phantom-powered inline gain booster that provides approximately +25dB of clean gain for dynamic and ribbon microphones. It is most commonly paired with the Shure SM7B to solve the noise floor issues that arise when interface preamps are pushed to high gain settings. Cloud Microphones effectively created this product category, and Shure eventually addressed the problem themselves with the SM7dB.

## Key Characteristics

- Provides +25dB of clean gain using phantom power from the interface
- Not a preamp -- it is a line amp that works with the existing preamp
- Reduces noise floor by allowing the preamp to run at lower gain settings
- Phantom power required (48V)
- Most commonly paired with the SM7B, but useful with any low-output dynamic or ribbon mic

## Use Cases

- SM7B vocal recording through budget interfaces (Apollo Twin, Focusrite, etc.)
- Any dynamic mic session where preamp gain is maxed and noise floor is an issue
- Ribbon mic recording where additional clean gain is needed

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Insert between the mic and preamp via XLR
- Ensure phantom power is engaged on the interface channel
- With the Cloudlifter in line, the preamp only needs to be set to roughly half the gain it would normally require

## Comparable Alternatives

| Product | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[FetHead]] | ~$100 | Similar function, different brand |
| Triton Audio FetHead | ~$100 | Same concept, popular alternative |
| Cathedral Pipes Durham | ~$100 | Another inline booster option |
| Shure SM7dB | ~$500 | SM7B with built-in preamp, solves the problem at the source |

## Common Mistakes

- Thinking the Cloudlifter is a preamp -- it is a gain stage that supplements the preamp
- Forgetting to engage phantom power (the Cloudlifter needs 48V to operate)
- Leaving the Cloudlifter in the signal chain when troubleshooting mic issues -- it must be physically removed for proper diagnosis
- Buying one when a better preamp would solve the gain problem more fundamentally

> "Cloudlifter isn't a preamp, it's a line amp, it works with the preamp to supply an extended amount of gain (+25db) for preamps that get noisey when you turn them up loud enough for a soft source with a dynamic mic."

> [!quote] Josh
> "So mine would sound fine through my twin until I'd mix it and the noise floor was wild. Definitely recommend a cloudlifter!"
