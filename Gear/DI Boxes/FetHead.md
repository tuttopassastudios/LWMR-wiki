# FetHead

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The FetHead (by Triton Audio) is an inline gain booster similar to the [[Cloudlifter]], providing clean gain for dynamic and ribbon microphones via phantom power. It is commonly used with the SM7B and similar low-output dynamic mics. In the community, it is referenced in troubleshooting contexts -- notably, it must be physically removed from the signal chain when diagnosing mic problems, and phantom power must be properly engaged for it to function.

## Key Characteristics

- Inline gain booster powered by 48V phantom power
- Compact barrel-style form factor
- Provides clean gain for dynamic and ribbon microphones
- Must be physically removed when troubleshooting signal issues
- Less expensive than the [[Cloudlifter]]

## Use Cases

- SM7B vocal recording with insufficient preamp gain
- Ribbon mic recording where additional clean gain is needed
- Budget alternative to the Cloudlifter

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Insert between mic and preamp via XLR
- Ensure phantom power is engaged on the interface
- When troubleshooting, remove the FetHead entirely -- do not just turn off phantom power

## Comparable Alternatives

| Product | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Cloudlifter]] | ~$150 | More widely known, same concept |
| Cathedral Pipes Durham | ~$100 | Another inline booster |
| Shure SM7dB | ~$500 | SM7B with built-in preamp |

## Common Mistakes

- Leaving the FetHead in the signal chain while troubleshooting -- "Did you unplug the FetHead for the no phantom power test? Doesn't work if it's still plugged in"
- Forgetting to engage phantom power
- Not bypassing the FetHead as part of standard troubleshooting when diagnosing mic issues
