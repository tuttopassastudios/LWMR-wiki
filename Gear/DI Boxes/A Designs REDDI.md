# A Designs REDDI

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The A Designs REDDI is a tube direct injection box prized for its warm, slightly compressed tone on bass guitar. It is one of the most commonly recommended tube DIs in the community, though some find it too hi-mid emphasized or "cloudy" for their taste. It has minimal controls -- just one knob and tube tone -- which makes it simple but inflexible.

## Key Characteristics

- Tube-based DI with natural compression from the tube circuit
- Single knob control -- simple but limited
- Warm, full tone with emphasis in the hi-mids
- Not budget-friendly (~$750)
- Frequently recommended for bass guitar recording
- Some users find it slightly cloudy compared to cleaner alternatives

## Use Cases

- Bass guitar DI recording
- Adding tube warmth and compression to DI signals
- Pairing with a separate mic'd amp for a two-source bass sound

## Comparable Alternatives

| DI Box | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Neve RNDI]] | ~$270 | Active, cleaner, wide fidelity |
| Noble DI | ~$600 | Tube, popular for bass |
| Avalon U5 | ~$600 | Solid state, very clean for reamping |
| Sarno V8 Octal Pre | ~$400 | Tube, fatter than noval tube DIs |
| UA 610 Pre/DI | ~$1500 | Tube pre with DI input, more versatile |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting the REDDI to be a clean, transparent DI -- it is colored by design
- Not considering that transistor DIs always sound like an "unfinished sound" for bass compared to tube options (per some members)
- Buying without A/B testing against the DI input on a good preamp like a 1073
