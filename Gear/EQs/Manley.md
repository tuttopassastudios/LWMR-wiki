# Manley

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Manley Labs produces a range of tube-based studio equipment including the [[Massive Passive]] EQ, Reference Cardioid microphone, SLAM stereo limiter, and various other processors. In community discussions, Manley appears across multiple product categories. The Manley Reference Cardioid microphone is noted for quality differences between pre-2011 and post-2011 production runs. The SLAM is recommended for clean compression, and Manley tube gear in general represents the premium end of the market.

## Key Characteristics

- Tube-based designs across their product line — EQs, compressors, and microphones
- The [[Massive Passive]] is their most famous EQ (see dedicated page)
- Manley Reference Cardioid microphone: pre-2011 units are considered superior to post-2011 production
- SLAM stereo limiter praised for clean compression characteristics
- Premium pricing across the product line, with some products increasing significantly in recent years
- Build quality and QC have been topics of discussion in the community

## Use Cases

- The SLAM for vocal and bus compression where clean tube compression is desired
- Reference Cardioid as a high-end vocal microphone (seek pre-2011 units)
- [[Massive Passive]] for tracking and mix EQ (see dedicated page)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The SLAM excels at clean settings for vocal tracking compression
- Pre-2011 Manley Reference Cardioid microphones are considered the ones to seek out on the used market

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Massive Passive]] | Manley's flagship EQ — see dedicated page |
| Soyuz microphones | Modern alternative to the Manley Reference Cardioid |
| [[Pultec EQP-1A]] | Simpler tube EQ; often preferred over the Massive Passive for tracking |
| Retro 176 | Alternative tube compressor praised alongside Manley products |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying a post-2011 Manley Reference Cardioid expecting it to match pre-2011 units — "Post 2011 don't hit like pre 2011"
- Holding onto Manley gear that is not serving your workflow out of brand loyalty
- Not considering that Manley products have become significantly more expensive, potentially pricing out some of their value propositions
