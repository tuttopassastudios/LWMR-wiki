# Neve 1081

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neve 1081 is a 4-band EQ/preamp module from the classic Neve console era, offering more EQ flexibility than the [[Neve 1073]] with an additional EQ band and more frequency selections. It appears in high-end studio tracking chains alongside vintage compressors and is used by top-tier engineers on everything from vocals to drums. The 1081 shares the fundamental Neve transformer sound but provides greater surgical control.

## Key Characteristics

- 4-band EQ with more frequency options than the [[Neve 1073]]'s 3-band design
- Same fundamental Neve transformer-coupled preamp topology
- Greater EQ flexibility allows for more precise tonal sculpting during tracking
- Available in vintage original and modern AMS Neve reissue formats
- Often found in large-format Neve console installations

## Use Cases

- High-end vocal tracking chains — used by cian riordan on sessions with Billie Eilish
- Drum recording where the additional EQ band provides more control
- Complete tracking chains: 1081 into [[1176]] or other compressors
- Studios that want Neve character with more EQ flexibility than the 1073

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- In professional vocal chains: microphone into 1081 into [[1176]] for a proven, high-end signal path
- The additional EQ band over the 1073 allows for more targeted frequency work while tracking
- Pairs well with [[Massive Passive]] or [[Pultec EQP-1A]] downstream for additional tonal shaping

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Neve 1073]] | Simpler 3-band EQ; some prefer its constraints |
| [[API 550]] | Different EQ character; API is punchier, Neve is broader |
| [[BAE Audio]] 1084 | Clone/reproduction of the similar Neve 1084 |
| [[Vintech]] X73 | More affordable Neve-style preamp/EQ |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming the 1081 and 1073 sound identical — the additional EQ band and different frequency centers create meaningful differences
- Overlooking the 1081 in favor of the more famous 1073 when the extra EQ flexibility would better serve the workflow
