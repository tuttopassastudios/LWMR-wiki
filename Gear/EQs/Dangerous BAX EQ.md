# Dangerous BAX EQ

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Dangerous BAX EQ is a stereo shelving and filter EQ designed for mix bus and mastering applications. Named after the Baxandall tone control circuit, it provides gentle high and low shelving EQ with high-pass and low-pass filters. The high shelf is well-liked in the community, while the low shelf receives more mixed reviews. It sits in an accessible price tier for a hardware stereo bus EQ.

## Key Characteristics

- Baxandall-style shelving EQ with high-pass and low-pass filters
- Stereo design intended for mix bus and mastering use
- The high shelf is broadly praised for adding air and sheen
- The low shelf is less universally loved — described as not everyone's taste
- Well-built at an accessible price point compared to premium mastering EQs
- Available in rack and 500-series (TK-lizer) formats
- Dangerous Music also makes the well-regarded SSL-style bus compressor (TK BC1)

## Use Cases

- Mix bus high-frequency shelving for adding air
- Mastering chain EQ for gentle tonal balance
- Pairing with bus compression for a complete analog 2-bus chain
- Studios wanting hardware bus EQ without spending $5,000+

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The high shelf is the star — gentle boosts for air and presence
- The filters (HPF/LPF) are useful for cleaning up the extremes on the mix bus
- Works well paired with the Dangerous bus compressor for a matched workflow

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Neve 8803 | More expensive; "a little too girthy" for some tastes |
| [[Pultec EQP-1A]] | Different approach; Pultec for warmth, BAX for precision shelving |
| [[Massive Passive]] | More flexible but significantly more expensive |
| SPL Fusion | Does approximately 3/4 of what the BAX does plus other processing |
| Tegeler EQ | Another budget-friendly stereo bus EQ option |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting the low shelf to be as universally loved as the high shelf — the low end character is not for everyone
- Buying the BAX when your existing tools (like the SPL Fusion) already cover most of its functionality
- Using the BAX for dramatic moves — it is designed for gentle, broad strokes on the mix bus
