# Massive Passive

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Manley Massive Passive is a stereo tube passive EQ often described as a "souped up Pultec." It offers significantly more flexibility than a [[Pultec EQP-1A]] with additional frequency points and bandwidth control, but community opinion is split on whether that flexibility translates to a better sound. Some engineers find the Massive Passive less exciting than a Pultec for tracking, while others appreciate its precision for mixing and mastering applications.

## Key Characteristics

- Stereo 4-band passive tube EQ with shelving and bell options per band
- More frequency options and bandwidth control than a [[Pultec EQP-1A]]
- Tube-based design that adds harmonic content when engaged
- Described as "basically souped up Pultecs at some level"
- High shelf frequencies reach 12k, 16k, and 27k for gentle air boosts
- The additional flexibility comes at the cost of some of the Pultec's "magic simplicity"

## Use Cases

- Mix bus EQ for gentle tonal shaping
- Mastering chains as a musical EQ
- High-frequency air boosting with the upper shelf bands (12k/16k/27k)
- Tracking when more precise passive EQ is needed than a Pultec provides

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Gentle shelf boosts at 12k, 16k, or 27k for adding air and sparkle
- Conservative settings on the mix bus — the Massive Passive excels at subtle, broad moves
- The magic is in the tube circuit and passive design, not in dramatic EQ moves

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Pultec EQP-1A]] | Simpler, more "magical" — many prefer Pultecs for tracking |
| [[Sontec EQ]] | Parametric mastering EQ; different approach to precision |
| [[Dangerous BAX EQ]] | More affordable shelving EQ for bus work |
| D.W. Fearn VT-5 | Another tube EQ option in the same price conversation |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying a Massive Passive expecting a dramatically better Pultec — some engineers find it "a bit of a snooze fest" compared to the Pultec's immediate magic
- Over-EQing because the additional controls invite more tweaking than necessary
- Not considering a pair of Pultecs instead, which some community members prefer despite the Massive Passive's greater flexibility
