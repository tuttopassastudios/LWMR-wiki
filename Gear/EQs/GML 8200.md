# GML 8200

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The GML 8200 is a parametric EQ designed by George Massenburg, who is credited with inventing the parametric equalizer. It is revered in mastering and high-end mixing for its transparency, precision, and musicality. The GML preamps are also highly regarded and considered to outperform [[Millennia HV-3]] in the transparency category. Despite its premium sound, the unit's aesthetics and ergonomics are often criticized.

## Key Characteristics

- Parametric EQ designed by the inventor of the parametric equalizer
- Extremely transparent and musical — "really special" in the words of experienced mastering engineers
- The preamp section (on units that include one) is considered exceptional for transparent recording
- Gain steps on the preamp are criticized as too large
- Industrial aesthetics — "they look grim"
- George Massenburg himself is described as "uptight" regarding specifications and usage
- Outperforms [[Millennia HV-3]] for transparent recording according to direct comparisons

## Use Cases

- Mastering EQ for precision tonal adjustments
- Transparent recording of acoustic instruments, particularly piano
- Folk music, classical, and any genre where transparency is paramount
- High-end mixing where surgical and musical EQ are both required

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Excels on piano recording — recommended to try at a "baller studio" for comparison against Millennia
- The EQ's musicality shines with moderate moves; it does not add noticeable color
- Best used when the goal is to alter tonality without changing character

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Sontec EQ]] | Similar mastering-grade parametric; GML is arguably more available and reliable |
| [[Millennia HV-3]] | GML "absolutely slays Millennia in the game" for transparency |
| Grace Design | Another transparency-focused competitor |
| Maselec MEA-2 | Alternative premium mastering parametric |

## Common Mistakes

- Dismissing GML gear because it "looks grim" or seems unsexy — the sound quality speaks for itself
- Being in an "everything needs color and distortion" phase and overlooking what GML does well
- Not trying GML preamps alongside the EQ — the preamps are "really special" in their own right
- Selling a GML and regretting it — multiple community members report this
