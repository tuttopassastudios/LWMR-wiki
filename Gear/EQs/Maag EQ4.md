# Maag EQ4

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Maag EQ4 is known for its distinctive "Air Band" — a fixed frequency band centered at 40kHz that adds air and presence to sources through an extremely broad shelf that reaches well down into the audible treble range. Available in both hardware and plugin formats, it is commonly used on vocals and mix buses for adding top-end sheen. The 40kHz band is more about the broad shelf shape than actual ultrasonic content.

## Key Characteristics

- Distinctive "Air Band" at 40kHz — the filter is so broad it reaches down into the upper treble range
- The 40kHz boost acts more as a very broad high shelf than a surgical ultrasonic boost
- Cranking the Air Band adds noticeable overall level, which can be confused with actual tonal improvement
- Simple, focused design — limited bands keep decisions fast
- Available as both hardware (500-series) and plugin
- Works best for additive high-frequency enhancement rather than corrective EQ

## Use Cases

- Vocal air and presence — a go-to for quick top-end enhancement
- Mix bus subtle brightness and openness
- Pop production where top-end sheen is a signature element
- Quick tone shaping when simplicity and speed are priorities

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- The Air Band at moderate settings adds genuine air and presence to vocals
- Be careful at extreme settings — the level increase can fool your ears into thinking the EQ is doing more than it is
- Works well as an early stage in the 2-bus chain before compression

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Pultec EQP-1A]] | Broader tone shaping; different character of high-end enhancement |
| Plugin Alliance Ruby 2 | Similar additive use case; also affects stereo field perception |
| Elysia X-Filter | High shelf up to 26kHz for similar air and sparkle |
| [[Massive Passive]] | 27kHz shelf option for gentler air boost in a more flexible EQ |

## Common Mistakes

- Cranking the 40kHz band and not compensating for the overall level increase — A/B at matched levels
- Using the Maag as a corrective EQ — it is designed for additive enhancement only
- Not understanding that the "40kHz" band is really a very broad shelf reaching well into audible frequencies
- Over-relying on the Air Band instead of addressing underlying mix issues
