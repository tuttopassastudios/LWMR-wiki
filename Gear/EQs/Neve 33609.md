# Neve 33609

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Neve 33609 is a stereo compressor/limiter (not strictly an EQ, but categorized here due to its tonal shaping role) that is prized for the dimensionality and tonal character it adds to material, even at minimal compression settings. The UAD plugin emulation is considered one of the hardest plugins to replace when going fully native. It is used on mix buses, drum buses, and as a go-to for adding "that Neve glue."

## Key Characteristics

- Stereo diode-bridge compressor/limiter with a distinctly Neve character
- Adds dimensionality even when barely compressing — "just wide open it adds this dimensionality that I haven't been able to replicate"
- The UAD plugin emulation is considered irreplaceable by many engineers going native
- Used as both a compressor and a tonal shaping tool
- Available in various revisions from vintage through modern AMS Neve production

## Use Cases

- Mix bus compression with subtle settings for "Neve glue"
- Tom bus and drum bus compression
- Any bus where subtle dimensionality and cohesion are desired
- Studio workflow where the 33609 character is part of the sound

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Wide open with minimal gain reduction — the character of the unit does the work
- On tom/drum bus for adding weight and cohesion
- Pairs well with [[SSL]] bus compression on the mix bus — some engineers alternate between the two

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[SSL]] G-Bus Compressor | Different character; VCA vs. diode-bridge |
| Arturia Neve compressor plugin | "Kinda gets close" to the UAD version |
| [[Manley Vari-Mu]] | Different compression topology but similar bus application |
| Shadow Hills Mastering Compressor | Alternative bus compressor with transformer switching |

## Common Mistakes

- Using the 33609 as a heavy compressor — its strength is in subtle, character-adding settings
- Expecting native plugins to fully replace the UAD 33609 emulation — this remains a gap in the market
- Not trying the unit wide open (no compression) just for the circuit tonality
