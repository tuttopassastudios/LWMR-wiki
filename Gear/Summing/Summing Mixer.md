# Summing Mixer

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Analog summing mixers are one of the most debated topics in the community. Proponents value the analog saturation and perceived width they add to ITB mixes, while skeptics argue the "color" comes primarily from the return preamps, not the summing itself. Several experienced members -- including those who owned SSL Sigma, Shadow Hills Equinox, and RND 5057 units -- ultimately moved back to ITB summing for convenience. The consensus is that summing can sound good but is not essential, and the workflow cost often outweighs the sonic benefit.

## Key Characteristics

- Combines multiple DAW outputs into a stereo mix through analog circuitry
- The perceived "color" largely comes from the return path (preamps bringing signal back to line level)
- Transformer-based designs add saturation; purely resistive designs are more transparent
- Requires significant I/O from the interface (many DA/AD channels)
- Reprints and revisions become much harder with analog summing in the chain
- Some members prefer getting analog saturation from individual channel inserts instead

## Use Cases

- Adding analog character to an ITB mix
- Parallel processing through analog outboard on stems
- Engineers who mix primarily on a console and want a similar workflow in a hybrid setup

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Keep settings documented meticulously -- recalling analog summing sessions months later is painful
- Consider whether you actually need summing or just stereo analog processing on the mix bus
- DIYRE makes a well-regarded DIY summing kit for budget-conscious builders

## Comparable Alternatives

| Summing Mixer | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [[Dangerous 2-Bus]] | ~$2500 | Flexible, well-regarded |
| SSL Sigma | ~$5000 | Remote-controlled, discontinued |
| Shadow Hills Equinox | ~$4000 | Multiple transformer options |
| RND 5057 | ~$3000 | Rupert Neve design |
| [[API Summing]] | ~$3000+ | API console flavor |
| DIYRE Colour Summing Kit | ~$500 | Budget DIY option |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming analog summing will magically improve a mix -- the effect is subtle at best
- Not accounting for the workflow cost: reprints, session recalls, extra I/O
- Attributing the "sound" of summing to the summing bus itself when it is really the return preamps
- Buying a summing mixer when stereo analog mix bus processing would achieve a similar result
- Getting jaded by online summing debates instead of trying it for yourself
