# API Summing

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> API is referenced in summing contexts primarily through the API 2500 bus compressor, which is used on the mix bus and drum buses. Opinions on the 2500 are split -- one mastering engineer calls it "awful sounding" while others love it on drums. The hardware version sounds notably different from the Waves plugin emulation. The newer 2500+ adds a mix knob. API console-style summing carries the characteristic API punch and midrange.

## Key Characteristics

- API 2500 bus compressor: polarizing opinions, loved on drums by many
- Hardware 2500 sounds different from the Waves plugin emulation
- Waves 2500 plugin is snappier than the hardware
- The 2500+ adds a wet/dry mix knob
- API summing carries the punchy, midrange-forward API console character
- Useful on drum buses and "pokey" mixes

## Use Cases

- Drum bus compression (most common recommendation)
- Mix bus compression (divisive -- some love it, some hate it)
- Vocal bus compression (as one of two compressors in a chain)
- Adding API console character to a hybrid workflow

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- On drums, the 2500 is praised for adding punch and glue
- Can work on "pokey" mixes or buses that need energy
- The Waves plugin and hardware are different enough to be considered separate tools

## Comparable Alternatives

| Product | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SSL G Bus Compressor | ~$3000 | Different flavor, smoother |
| [[Dangerous 2-Bus]] | ~$2500 | Summing focused |
| [[Summing Mixer]] (various) | Varies | For actual summing vs bus processing |
| Waves API 2500 Plugin | ~$30 | Snappier than hardware |

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming the Waves API 2500 plugin sounds like the hardware -- "nothing remotely like the actual thing"
- Using the 2500 on everything -- it works best on drums and specific buses
- Dismissing the 2500 based on one person's opinion when it is genuinely polarizing
