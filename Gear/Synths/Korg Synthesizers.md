# Korg Synthesizers

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Korg offers a wide range of synthesizers and effects units that are frequently mentioned in the community for their affordability, fun factor, and quality sound. From the classic MS-20 mono synth to the modern Modwave and OpSix, Korg provides accessible entry points into analog and digital synthesis. Their delay units (SDD-3000, SDD-1000) are also valued studio tools.

## Key Characteristics

- **MS-20**: Classic semi-modular mono synth with 1/4" patch points; affordable and fun to use
- **Modwave**: Modern wavetable synth; "so customisable" with ability to save patches
- **OpSix**: FM synthesis in modern form factor; "solid fundamentals with enough new and interesting options"
- **"Logue" series** (Minilogue, Prologue): Affordable polyphonic analog with lots of knobs
- **Electribe**: Groovebox/sequencer platform
- **SDD-3000/SDD-1000**: Dedicated delay units valued for studio use as guitar pedal alternatives
- Korg pedals recommended for hands-on delay manipulation in the studio

## Use Cases

- MS-20 as an affordable mono synth for bass and lead sounds
- Modwave/OpSix for production and sound design
- Logue series as budget-friendly first analog polysynth
- SDD-1000 as a dedicated hardware delay for mixing
- Korg effects units as "preset machines" in rack setups
- Guitar pedal processing with Korg SDD-3000

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- MS-20 patch points allow semi-modular experimentation
- Korg delay units work best as dedicated, always-on effects rather than parameter-tweaking tools
- Boss RE-20 Space Echo pedal pairs well with Korg synths for texture work

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Behringer K-2 | MS-20 clone at lower price |
| [[Moog Synthesizers\|Moog Sub Phatty]] | More expensive mono alternative |
| [[Roland Juno]] | Different flavor of affordable analog |
| [[Yamaha DX7]] | Different synthesis type (FM) but similar price range for vintage |
| Yamaha SPX90 | Alternative rack delay/effects unit |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting rack-mount Korg delay units to be easy to tweak in real time — most have button-based interfaces best suited as preset machines
- Overlooking the Logue series when seeking affordable analog poly sounds
