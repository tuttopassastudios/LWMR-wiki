# Oberheim Synthesizers

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Oberheim synthesizers hold a special place in the analog synth world, known for their distinctive thick, warm character. The community discusses several models: the OB-6 (collaboration with Dave Smith/Sequential), the new TEO-5, the vintage Four Voice, and the Matrix series. The OB-6 is often mentioned alongside the Prophet 6 as a top-tier modern analog polysynth, and newer affordable models like the TEO-5 are generating excitement.

## Key Characteristics

- **OB-6**: Modern Oberheim/Sequential collaboration; described as "more inspiring" than Prophet 6 by some
- **TEO-5**: New compact polysynth under $2,000; "sounds really, really good" with extensive modulation matrix
- **Four Voice**: Vintage classic; the bass sounds are particularly praised
- **Matrix 6R**: Valued for extensive modulation matrix ("anything can modulate anything")
- Oberheim tone is distinctly different from Prophet — thicker, often described as lush
- Philosophy: "if you can still get the real thing from the original manufacturer, buy it from them" (sukhuno)

## Use Cases

- Lush analog pads and leads
- Bass synthesis (particularly the Four Voice)
- Modern production requiring distinctive analog character
- TEO-5 as an affordable entry into the Oberheim sound

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- OB-6 module is less inspiring than keyboard version (Zack Hames regrets not getting the OB-6 as keyboard)
- TEO-5 modulation matrix is a key feature for sound design
- Vintage units pair well with external effects processors

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Prophet Synth\|Prophet 6]] | Same era Sequential design; different sonic character |
| [[Moog Synthesizers]] | Different flavor of analog warmth |
| UDO Super 6 | "A modern future classic" — different but similarly inspiring |
| Behringer UB-Xa | Budget OB-Xa clone |

## Common Mistakes

- Getting the OB-6 as a desktop module when the keyboard version is more inspiring to play
- Overlooking the TEO-5 as a surprisingly capable and affordable Oberheim option
- Not buying from the original manufacturer when current production models are available
