# Roland Juno

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Roland Juno series (particularly the Juno 106 and Juno 60) is one of the most iconic analog synthesizers in music production, beloved for its lush chorus effect and warm, immediate pad sounds. While vintage units command high prices, the community actively discusses affordable software alternatives that can get close to the real thing. The Juno's chorus circuit alone has become a legendary effect used across genres.

## Key Characteristics

- **DCO-based architecture** — digitally controlled oscillators provide stable tuning with analog warmth
- The famous **Juno chorus** (Chorus I and Chorus II) is the defining characteristic of the sound
- Most old Junos are mono output until the chorus is engaged for stereo
- Simple, immediate interface with limited but musical parameters
- The Juno 106 has well-documented oscillator design using a clever DCO approach
- Vintage units are mono by default; stereo comes from the chorus circuit

## Use Cases

- Lush pad sounds — the quintessential Juno application
- Chordal parts with movement via the chorus
- Double-tracking technique: record mono synth parts twice and hard pan for width
- Pairing with external reverb (e.g., Strymon BigSky, Valhalla) for atmospheric textures
- The Juno chorus effect alone is used on guitars, vocals, hi-hats, and more

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- **Chorus II** for the classic thick Juno sound
- Mono for sub bass parts, stereo (via chorus) for chordal content
- Double-tracking with slight patch variations for natural stereo spread
- TAL Juno chorus plugin (free) can add the Juno character to any source

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| TAL-U-NO-LX (plugin) | "Kind of the goat of software Junos" — highly recommended |
| Roland Cloud Juno (plugin) | "Crazy close" to the real thing |
| Arturia Jun-6 V (plugin) | Sounds "more tasteful" than TAL; preferred by some for subtlety |
| [[Prophet Synth]] | Different character but comparable polysynth |
| [[Korg Synthesizers]] | Korg "logue" series as affordable analog poly alternative |

## Common Mistakes

- Spending $2,000+ on a vintage Juno when software alternatives are "crazy close"
- Not exploring the free TAL Juno chorus plugin before buying a hardware unit
- Faking stereo with a plugin on a mono signal instead of double-tracking
- Overlooking that most subtractive synths can approximate Juno sounds with the right chorus
