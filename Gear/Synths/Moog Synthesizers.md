# Moog Synthesizers

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Moog synthesizers are revered for their thick, warm analog sound, particularly for bass. The community discusses several models: the Voyager (discontinued, sought-after), the Subsequent 37, the Slim Phatty/Sub Phatty, the Model D, and the large modular systems (Model 10, System 55). Moog occupies a unique place as the quintessential mono synth brand, though members are increasingly curious about their polyphonic and modular offerings.

## Key Characteristics

- **Voyager**: "Thick and buttery, about as warm-sounding as a synth gets," excellent for bass, cleaner than Subsequent 37, superb oscillators and filters, great keyboard feel, but heavy and expensive ($4,000–$5,000+ used)
- **Subsequent 37**: Multiple distortion stages integrated into architecture, more aggressive/gnarly tone than Voyager
- **Slim Phatty**: Last Moog designed by Bob Moog himself; "sounds utterly incredible and is superb bang for your buck" but requires some menu diving
- **Sub Phatty**: Same as Slim Phatty but with all knobs and keys exposed
- **Model D**: Beloved for bass sounds, classic Minimoog tone
- **Large modular systems** (Model 10, System 55): Different oscillators and filters from the Minimoog; considered by some to be the "pinnacle of analog bass synth sounds"
- **Sound Studio**: Self-contained modular system following eurorack voltage standards

## Use Cases

- Bass synthesis — the definitive analog bass synth
- Kick drum sub generation — "mult a kick mic and send it through the Moog, set the resonance on the filter high enough so it's on the edge of self-oscillating" (peterlabberton)
- Modular synthesis and sound design
- Texture creation when paired with effects pedals (delay, chorus)
- Receiving arps from DAW/808 and manipulating filters for textures

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Voyager: Factory patches plus external effects (delay pedals, Boss CE2) yield great results
- Filter self-oscillation trick for generating sub frequencies from other audio sources
- Modular systems pair well with Eventide H9, Strymon pedals, Chase Bliss pedals, OTO BIM/BAM
- Eurorack patching via 1/8" cables (standard for Moog modular and Sound Studio)

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Behringer Model D | Budget Minimoog clone; "more fun" than some desktop modules |
| Behringer Poly D | Affordable paraphonic option |
| [[Prophet Synth]] | Better for polyphonic duties; "buy a monosynth AND polysynth for the price of a Voyager" |
| Softube Model 72 (plugin) | "Does the Minimoog thing very well" |
| UAD Minimoog (plugin) | Good software alternative; "sounded good to me" |
| Arturia Mini V (plugin) | Part of the V Collection |

## Common Mistakes

- Spending $5,000+ on a Voyager when a Subsequent 37 + polysynth would cover more ground
- Using the Voyager as a master MIDI controller — only 3.5 octaves, non-piano key action
- Expecting the Minimoog to sound identical to the large Moog modular systems — the oscillators and filters are different designs
- Not exploring external effects pairing — Moog synths really open up with pedals
