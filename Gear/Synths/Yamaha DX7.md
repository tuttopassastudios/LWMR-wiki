# Yamaha DX7

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Yamaha DX7 is the legendary FM synthesis keyboard from the 1980s, known for its iconic electric piano patches and bell-like tones. Community members who own hardware units speak fondly of squeezing every sound possible from the instrument. The Arturia DX7 V plugin is the recommended software emulation, with consensus that it closely replicates the original including its characteristic hiss.

## Key Characteristics

- **FM synthesis** — fundamentally different from analog subtractive synthesis
- Iconic E-piano patch is the most requested sound from the DX7
- Hardware units are affordable on the used market
- Programming is notoriously difficult without external editors
- Patch Base app integrates with the DX7 via MIDI for easier editing
- Pairs well with effects pedals (Microcosm, Infinite Jets, delay)

## Use Cases

- Classic FM electric piano sounds
- Bell and metallic tones
- Texture creation when run through effects pedals
- "Great on keys and soft synths" when combined with the Microcosm pedal
- Production of 80s-influenced sounds

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Factory presets are a strong starting point — "I've squeezed just about every inch I can out of these"
- Patch Base app on iPad/iPhone provides full editing capability via MIDI
- Running through delay pedals and Boss CE2 chorus adds dimension
- Arturia DX7 V: mod wheel rate may need adjustment to match hardware feel

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Arturia DX7 V (plugin) | Consensus pick for best DX7 emulation; "really sounds like it, even has the same hiss" |
| Dexed (free plugin) | Good but glitchy; doesn't save presets reliably; doesn't work in Pro Tools |
| [[Korg Synthesizers\|Korg OpSix]] | Modern FM synthesis in hardware |
| Native Instruments FM8 | Another FM synth option |

## Common Mistakes

- Using Dexed in Pro Tools — it is not compatible
- Expecting easy sound design without an external editor — the DX7 interface is notoriously difficult
- Not exploring Patch Base for hardware programming
