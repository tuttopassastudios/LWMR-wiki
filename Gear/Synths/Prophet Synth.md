# Prophet Synth

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> The Sequential Prophet line (Prophet 5, 6, Rev 2, 10) is widely considered among community members to be the definitive analog polysynth. The Prophet 6 in particular is frequently described as a "be all end all for analog synth sounds" and the one synth members would choose if limited to a single instrument. Known for exceptional pads, immediate tactile control, and an inspiring playing experience.

## Key Characteristics

- **True analog signal path** with discrete VCOs and analog filters
- Prophet 6 can approximate classic Prophet 5 sounds while adding modern convenience
- Rev 2 offers deeper synthesis capabilities at a lower price point than the Prophet 6
- Prophet 8 features polyphonic aftertouch for enhanced expression
- Prophet 10 is the flagship model at approximately $4,000
- Build quality described as "super solid" with "tons of useful knobs at your fingertips"
- Every sound described as "interesting" straight out of the box

## Use Cases

- Pads — "does pads better than most plugins I've heard" (Rollmottle)
- General analog synth duties across genres
- Songwriting and production — valued for inspiring workflow and creative joy
- Live performance (keyboard versions strongly preferred over desktop modules)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Factory patches are a strong starting point for most users
- The keyboard version is strongly recommended over desktop modules — multiple members regret buying modules as they are "less inviting to play"
- When paired with effects (delay pedals, reverb), the Prophet opens up dramatically
- Running through external effects chains (e.g., Fulltone Tube Tape Echo, Roland Space Echo) for stereo processing

## Comparable Alternatives

| Gear | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Oberheim Synthesizers\|OB-6]] | Same manufacturer collaboration; described as "more inspiring" by some |
| [[Moog Synthesizers\|Moog Subsequent 37]] | Mono alternative; different tonal character |
| U-he Repro-5 (plugin) | Software emulation; good for previewing the sound |
| Behringer DeepMind | Budget poly; "sounds great but feels like a toy" |
| [[Roland Juno]] | Different character; more lo-fi charm |

## Common Mistakes

- **Buying the desktop module instead of keyboard version** — "Everyone I know with desktop synths regret getting them because they are less inviting to play" (GaspardMurph)
- Expecting soft synths to replicate the tactile experience and workflow benefits
- Not checking output level balance on new units — one member reported 1.3dB channel imbalance on multiple Prophet 6 units from DSI
- Spending $4,000+ on a Prophet 10 when room treatment or monitors may be a higher priority
