    "content": "1) a strong work ethic: You have to be willing to put in the time and energy into the project. You will always be the first person there and the last to leave. Once you accept this and work it into your life, it just becomes the way it is!\n\n2) a good personality: You need to be good around people. Half of this job is psychological. You have to know when to speak up as well as when to not say anything. Talkback etiquette is crucial. Learn to read people. Never get angry or passive aggressive. You always need to be voice of reason. People have to trust you.\n\n3) a solid skill-set: You have to always know what your doing and be confident in your abilities. Know the technical side of things. You should also be musically inclined. Be curious! Why does a song sound a certain way? How did they do it? If you don't care and don't want to know \u2013 you should do something else.\n\n4) actual follow through: You'd be surprised how many flaky people work in this business. If you're a guy that does things when you say you'll do them and answers phonecalls/emails in a timely manner, then you're already leagues above most other people.\n\n5) the ability to network with people and capitalize on your relationships is the only way to move forward in this business. Going to shows, parties, events, etc. You never know where work is going to come from.\n\nYour work gets you work. Make sure everything you do is the best representation of your abilities. Don't choose which projects to care more about. Give it your all on everything... even if its a shitty gig. That word will spread and you'll start getting more work through that.\n\nHope this helpful. Good luck!",

Critical of  Greg Wells pandering to whatever his base is. But recommending a 4k converter based on 'audible conversion quality' isn't helpful if the consumer doesn't have a million other ducks in a row first -- room treatment, adequate monitoring, proper gainstaging, etc. Jon has that figured out, so it makes sense for him. But when people come into a forum with questionable knowledge and background in music production asking what's the best converter, I think it's fair to ask some prying questions before just making blanket recommendations on what one person heard or not. I have plenty of semi-OK stuff that still gets used on the regular, and plenty of expensive gear that I would happily toss out of my workflow. They're all just tools. And whether its bougie DW Fearn or a black-friday Acustica plugin, , if it works for your workflow and gets you results you're happy with, then its worth whatever money you're willing to pay for it.",

Having this perspective is massively useful in mixing other peoples tracks, because I feel I have a north star of what good drums can sound like if they\u2019re recorded and performed properly. It used to be that my starting point for mixing drums were working with tracks that I had recorded myself\u2026 and most of the above problems were solved before the mix stage. These days, with smaller budgets and time constraints, its very rare that this is a possibility.\n\nI\u2019m including this drum tracking session from a few years ago that I recorded at Barefoot. It was for a project that Matt was producing that never saw the light of day. But we went all out with the drum setup in the big room, through the console, and had a great drummer. This might be useful for some people who have never gotten properly recorded drum tracks\u2026 to get a sense of how good thigns can sound before the \u2018mix\u2019 stage. These are the tracks that were printed into Pro Tools off of the console, and the three busses were prints of the outboard compressor busses we were using while monitoring. It\u2019s unlikely these busses would get used in mixing, but they\u2019re a good reference to what we were listening to in the room while we were tracking. But as you\u2019ll notice, the individual drum blend can stand on it\u2019s own two feet. Hopefully this is useful as well.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

Now  I am just trying to inspire the artists and writers around me, I'll deal with the sonics later. Much better results.\n\nI also used to fully mix-as-I-go, which painted me into a corner with gain staging and eq.

After that, all negotiations were done as that new number being my base rate, and anything less was a discount (I love the idea above of marking that discount on the invoice so your full rate is still shown). I sort of felt guilty for awhile charging that much, thinking I wasn't at that level, but then started to notice most clients instantly started to get pretty close to that number, where before they were half of that.

    "content": "The landscape for pitching songs has changed dramatically in the last decade. It still exists, but it has shrunk to the point where even the top level writers can't rely on it as much.\n\nThis is simply because many more people can write songs and make demos quickly. This results in two things: the market is flooded with songs, and artists who used to rely on pitch songs are now writing (or co-writing) the majority of their material.\n\nMany songs that used to be sent to an artist are now brought into the room and finished with the artist themselves. Like, you'd pitch a chorus or a 3/4 finished song to an artist and finish with them on the spot.\n\nThe genres where pitching songs still predominates are country the (industry is still writer\u2013driven), EDM (many artists are performers who do not write or produce), and pop (but they're mostly just looking for HITS).\n\nAnother consequence of this shrinking pitch landscape is that the projects that need \"outside\" songs are much more gate-kept by people in the industry. In country, there are publishers and labels that generally source the songs. In pop, labels and executive producers (of specific projects) tend to be the gate keepers, and in EDM it is a similar combo.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the best way to pitch songs is to build direct relationships with artists or go through the various business people who gate-keep the process.\n\nTo advise you based on your question: make incredible records with your friends, peers, and the people around you, and get visibility that way. Hustle like crazy and use every moment of new visibility as a stepping stone to get in the mix with the larger music community. Ultimately you probably sign a publishing deal and sing with a manager where you get business representatives to help guide you and connect you further.\n\nAs with all things music, if you actually really for real make A+ records, people will find you. It's just that this is a lot harder than people think.",

    "content": ".\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively)\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

Instead, you were surrounded by expert speakers and learned through interactions with people who were leagues ahead of you in their ability to speak the language. Learning to speak is not an easy task, but by immersing yourself in a community of experts you are on the path to mastery and in no time you'll reap the benefits of that exposure.",

    "content": "It's a big topic, but gain staging is about finding the optimal amount of gain at every stage of the recording and mixing process.\n\nGood gain staging allows you to get the best fidelity out of a recording by preventing things from creating unwanted distortion or amplifying unwanted noise. **OR** if you are *seeking* some distortion and compression it's about turning up the gain enough to give you the amount that you're seeking from your tools.\n\nGain staging is something to be considered at all steps of the production process. For example:\n\n*1. How loud is an amplifier turned up in the room? Is the microphone being blow out by it?\n\n2. How high is the gain on a microphone preamp and is it at risk of clipping if the performer plays loudly?\n\n3. Is the gain so low that when I turn a signal up later on the noise floor will rise with it?\n\n4. If I'm recording to tape, am I recording quiet enough that it won't saturate the signal, or do I want for the signal to slam the tape and be saturated?\n\n5. How loud is an individual channel in a DAW? Is it making the channel clip?\n\n6. How loud is a signal that's being sent into a piece of hardware or a plugin? Am I distorting the circuitry at all?\n\n7. Is my signal coming in so hot that it makes a compressor react way too hard?\n\n8. How loud is the entire track I'm mixing? Is the limiter crushing the dynamics in an unwanted way? Or am I hitting it just with just enough level to get a certain flavor of pumping and clipping?\n\n9. Is my final mix going to hit digital zero and create unwanted clipping?*\n\nSo gain staging is not a single thing, but a series of choices that are made every step of the way around how you manage the \"voltage\" of your signals. Together these choices all add up to a mix that \"breathes\" well and is free of excessive or unwanted distortion.",

Your DAW is going to have some perfectly capable EQ's and compressors to tide you over until you're ready for FabFilter.\n\nPut another way, your production work is upstream of your mixing work and will influence the sound of your records more.",

    "content": "I have a couple distinct phases of my workflow. The \u201ctechnical\u201d phase let\u2019s call it, is all about letting my brain objectively search for the very specific kinds of things that are distracting within the mix at hand. This is much more of a thinking and corrective process than it is a feeling one, even though feeling and taste is 100% involved. This part of the process is to get the mix on a more solid foundation if needed.\n\nThe next phase is where I want to actively NOT be thinking at all. This is why I do the first part separately. I want to be FEELING the music in this phase and not be taken out of it by the vocal resonance at 1.8k at 1:35 in the bridge. I want to turn that part of my brain off so I can focus on the music, the feeling, the lyrics, the intent, the song and try to find where (or if) I can elevate or reveal or better frame the heart of what\u2019s there. This is meant to be the flow state, moving intuitively and viscerally based on what\u2019s coming out of the speakers. This is where efficiency in toolset matters -- where an extremely efficient human-computer interaction matters, where knowing your tools cold matters. I want to reduce latency between feeling and move and I don\u2019t want anything to get in my way. \n\nSo to answer your question: I think about ways to continue to be able to access and preserve that crucial flow state during the time where it matters the most. And it can manifest a million ways that aren\u2019t directly related to mastering at all: taking a walk, working out, doing a J, listening to a new record, checking Discord, unplugging, whatever. And yes, sometimes it also means refining my template or my Streamdeck shortcuts or creating a new preset.",

If you mic that amp with a single mic, that mono signal has the reverb as a part of it. When you pan that complete signal, it carries a kind of depth and character that is very different from a stereo reverb or even a separate send. \n\nMono elements with their own reverb can achieve an interesting spatial clarity that you can't get with eq or compression or whatever else you use to give elements their own place in a mix. I use it on all kinds of things from guitars to vocals to drums to whatever.",

I'd say as years go on, I've learned to separate feelings of pressure/responsibility/schedule density from \"stress\" or being \"overwhelmed\" in the true sense. There's that Dale Becker quote, \"Don't feel victimized by your work.\" Making peace with what it feels like to be responsible for someone's record, or your own music, is important. It carries a lot of weight, but it's a privelage to be able to do it and it should not break your spirit. Not that that's necessarily what's got you feeling this way.\n\nLots of ways to dive deeper if you'd like to share more about where you're coming from.",

It finally clicked that many folks these days (especially in the pop world) are getting stems to mix from \u2014 not full multitrack sessions \u2014 and often not real drumsets/instruments in real rooms. In my world, for better or worse, I\u2019m almost always getting multitrack files. So the prospect of only spending 2-3 hours on a mix is just impossible. That will often times barely get me past the drum sound! So for us mere mortals that are still stuck mixing real instruments, here\u2019s my process for approaching drum mixing.",

In this sense, I think he's listening closely to the effect that a cut has on every other instrument in a mix - not just the instrument he's subtracting from.",

Efficient method goes like this:\n\nPT Downmixer stock plugin is the one for this (it collapses stereo channels to mono) - flip the phase of one side in the GUI and save that as your user default. If you insert your Downmixer on a faux stereo track, it\u2019ll immediately silence it, so you can happily split and delete what you don\u2019t need. \n\n(Check the meters though, sometimes ambience or other subtle stereo info isn\u2019t very audible unless cranked.)\n\nIf the stereo track contains slightly panned mono information, pushing/pulling either of the faders in Downmixer will quickly get it to cancel, and you can note how much extra gain you need to add or subtract when level matching in the final step (below). Obviously if it\u2019s deliberately panned info, you can either just leave the track stereo or match the pan position by ear (I prefer to do this because I like mono channels to behave like mono channels, and also half the CPU you\u2019d use on a stereo track).\n\nFinally, use clip gain to add 3dB to the resulting mono channel, and obviously pan it centre.

If you are hunting for a particular word/phrase, you can highlight the region and use control-p or control-; to move up or down through the playlists, then hit shift-s, then hit play to listen. Then if its the one, promote it to the top playlist with control-option-v. If you get the motions in your brain, you can really fly through takes and get a comp together quickly.",

    "content": "i love this question. i've been doing this for long enough that the cycles of how records sound has changed several times. so every few years i try and take some time to unlearn/relearn.\n\nthere's no good short answer, but i'd start with taking some time outside of mixing to just listen to records. whether you've done this before or not, get to know your speakers and your monitoring environment better than before. listen to your favorite records that you know well, and make some tweaks. you don't necessarily have to redo your whole setup, but listen to your speakers in slightly different positions, different settings on the back of the speaker, etc. and really dig into listening and enjoy yourself.\n\nthat's usually enough to make me think about mixes very differently (which ultimately means i get better when i re-incorporate most of the things i already know). but if you need more, just try and simplify. start a mixing by just leveling everything. clip gain and leveling and panning. then balance frequencies and compress (via compressor or saturator or limiter or whatever). basically, with fresh ears, go back to basics.\n\nnot sure if that will transform you into a new mixer, but that's an outline of an approach i use when i feel like i need a big talent upgrade",

    "content": "One thing I'd add is the importance of matching your output levels so that the dry sound and the compressed sound are the same volume when you bypass the compression. Many compressors have have automatic volume compensation included and others will require you to adjust the makeup gain that comes after the compression.\n\nThe reason it's important is because when we're comparing the dry signal to the compressed signal, the louder of the two signals will always feel better to us. It's important to match the volume levels when comparing so that we're not fooling ourself into thinking a louder signal is better and we can hear the compression (or most effects) for what really is.",

I think you'll be surprised when you someday realize that a tremendous amount of people have no idea what they're doing; even those who seem in control. You do your best in the moment and then build on what you've learned and you do it even better the next time.\n\nDon't be afraid of failure. The most courageous thing that you can do is to put yourself in a situation where you feel vulnerable. You will fail and you will fail again, and finally you will succeed. Then you will find yourself in a situation where you get to fail at bigger, better things. That's the process of self-actualization.\n\nYou should repeatedly strive to put yourself in a position that puts you at the edge of your abilities. That very feeling of being uncomfortable is a sign that you're in the right place. Challenge yourself and go for it. Pushing yourself in this way is the path to growth and achievement.\n\nYou're doing great.",

I remember being thirteen and trying every Mexican strat at the Sherman Oaks guitar center and one was just clearly better. I still have it to this day.",

    "content": "Making the jump from working on music for local bands to making music for bigger commercial acts was obviously a big move forward. What I realized very quickly is that the process is fundamentally the same with people of all levels. You get in a room, you make a plan, and you execute it. However, when you've got a major label backing you, there's many more resources available, enabling you to spend more time (and money) making the record... although in my experience this can be both a blessing and a curse!\n\nI assisted Eric for a few years and eventually started networking with more local Los Angeles artists and was able to mix and produce their stuff out of Eric's studio. He was very cool about letting me use the space when we weren't working on bigger projects. He set a very high standard and made it clear that anything that left our studio had to sound really, really great. After assisting and working on my own stuff for several years, Eric then hired me as his full-time main engineer and now I'm on call to work on him for any of his projects. This has been amazing in so many ways as I get to work on high-level commercial music and apply all of my own sensibilities to the process \u2013 as well as the stuff I've learned from Eric over the years.\n\nObviously my tale is one in a million and there's not a day that goes my where I don't realize how lucky I am. Now that I've worked full time recording music for almost 8 years, I've realized there are certain things you need to have to be successful:",

It still is for many, but I say \"used to\" because a lot of people's #1 music listening environment outside of a studio is the phone/ headphones/ AirPods. \n\nSo my \"car test\" is now AirPod max headphones walking around my neighborhood in LA or taking the tube in London. \n\nBut the car also has its advantages because it's noisy and imperfect and NOT isolated like the studio and headphones. You can't listen as precisely in a car, which often tells you very quickly whether you can hear the important parts of your song (can you hear the vocal? Does the low end feel good?).",

My first real big break came from helping out with and swapping songs with a college buddy, who then managed to get a record deal, and I got to come up and help a little bit and meet with their producer. After a brief stint in Australia in another band, like Matt Rad, I relentlessly (but respectfully) kept reaching out to the producer to see if there was any toilets I could clean or any help at all I could give him, or even if he was just available for a quick lunch and could I play him some bands I was working on.  After a couple months he brought me in and taught me melodyne saying \u201cif you get good at this you\u2019re going to own a house someday\u201d. \n\nThis post is coming from inside the house. \n\nI think the mistake a lot of people make is they reach out hoping that someone can help them, and not with the intent of how they can help the person they\u2019re reaching out to. I never planned to be Vocal Producer to the Stars \u2122\ufe0f but it turned out it was a job that needed to be done that other people didn\u2019t want to do, and I started to get passed from big name producer to bigger name producer, and then I got enough clout to actually be the middle sized name producer.

Everything on headphones is going to sound clear and direct, when that may not be the case coming through speakers. Checking stuff on some decent monitors in a decent room -- or even in your car --  is always the best way to know if things sound off or not. If you're stuck with headphones, something open back like a Sennheiser 600 will give you a less-hyped, more honest picture of your mix. They're also much less fatiguing to work on for long periods of time! But even to this day with my nice setup, I'm always checking the low end in different places... In my car, I'll know within 10 seconds of listening if things are where they're supposed to be or not.",

Even Doug Sax had to step in to set them straight.\n\nThe short of it is, if someone is venturing down the path of manufacturing vinyl for their project \u2014 *especially* if it\u2019s self funded \u2014 they have to ask what they\u2019re really looking to achieve. If they want a high-quality, analog preservation of their record for all to enjoy, then they need to be prepared to spend some real coin to achieve good results. If they just want a physical item to sell at shows and toss in a download code \u2014 that\u2019s OK too \u2014 but it will still be pricey, and probably won\u2019t sound great if you do it on the cheap.

It's usually a matter of building up the low end  first and bringing the mix to the brink of crapping out whatever master chain you have without completely falling apart. Then trying to shoe horn in the other elements with aggressive & drastic scooping to maintain the gain structure you've got going with the 808s. Like Jon says often, it's usually about turning things down to gain headroom, and then making it up with low end boosts or high cuts. It's so impressive when it's done right -- shoutout to J.C. -- him and Ali are the best in the game IMHO.",

So turning everything down -6 (or -12 or -3, whatever you want) just gives your processing chain a chance to not fuck things up.",

    "content": "Man. 85 percent of the tracks I\u2019d get would require an hour of trying to line up the song PROPERLY to the grid. It\u2019s not as easy as lining a kick to the grid as half you guys are using kick samples that have space before the transient.  When I\u2019m out here nudging and stretching vocals at 1/1000th of second resolutions, which can dramatically change the pocket and vibe, it\u2019s a kick in the teeth then if the whole track ends up being a tenth of a second off. \n\nThe trick I came up with was putting four low frequency Square wave bursts maybe an 1/8th note long each at the beginning or end of each song. That means at no matter the master bus processing (or worse the mp3 meta data at the beginning pushing the song back) you can recalibrate EXACTLY the track back on to the grid. In that case, once you\u2019ve figured that bit out, slap whatever you want on the bus. The square wave trick is how we were able to prove how logic or ableton was bouncing out of time even when a ton of people didn\u2019t hear it or notice.",

I think you\u2019re going to hit some sonic limitations with the quality of your signal path and the cymbals you are using, but the drums sound pretty good and the space you\u2019re in isn\u2019t terrible. Some notes:\n- Your cymbal mic'ing approach might be a little overly comprehensive. Its nice to have spot mics on each cymbal, but might be worth trying a more traditional overhead approach. It\u2019ll help get a more natural image of the kit and will likely free up some microphones for other spot positions on the drum set or in the room.\n- Your kick drum sounds like a basketball. Theres a few things you can do with tuning, but I would firsttry having some dampening inside. If you like them sounding wide open, then consider taping some felt or paper towels to the inside of the drum shell, at least half way around the interior circumference of the shell. It\u2019ll help quash that bouncing basketball sound.\n- Your snare sounds beefy! Obviously, its going to be song and arrangement dependent, but on its own it sounds like you could voice it a little higher to get it to crack a little more.\n- If you free up some mics by simplifying your cymbal setup, consider having a mic at the \u2018crotch\u2019 position\u2026 picking up the center of the kit. It can be useful for anchoring the mono signal of the drums and gives you something nice to potentially squash or distort down the road.\n- Your room mics sound pretty good with the right EQing!",

Regardless of whether I\u2019m mixing something I engineered/produced, or something from someone else, I usually start by muting most things and building the song back gradually. As I piece things back in I always have an ear out for resonant pokey stuff and just try to address it ASAP. That\u2019s either through using spectral shaper (very new to me but awesome) or soothe, or just notching stuff with an EQ. I personally avoid doing any of this on the mix bus\u2014if I\u2019m doing it on busses it\u2019ll be some kind of subgroup. Once things are nice and clean, you can boost a lot to get clarity/aggression/etc. etc.. I will say since you mentioned working late at night, I feel getting a decent volume out of my monitors is pretty revealing for this. I don\u2019t mix all that loud, but I definitely have a decent level going. My goal is always to be able to crank things and not have harsh stuff poking at my eardrums!",

Most likely Eric\u2019s Sonor birch kick drum with a Remo Black Dot on it. Almost certainly Vistalite toms\u2026 and this sounds like a Bell Brass snare.\n\n3) Room mics are placed probably 20 feet away, spaced wide, pointed at the kit. Eric would always point the room mics away from the drums with the cardioid null towards the drum kit, but I found I got more direct, punchy sounds with it facing the drums. Chamber mics would\u2019ve been a foot apart, pointed 45 degs out\u2026 sort of intentionally phasey to make them wider.\n\n4) Yeah, you\u2019re onto it. The overheads are intentionally wide and close to the cymbals. The mono mic and close mics are doing the heavy lifting with the drums and the L/R OHs are almost just cymbal spot mics with some kit stereo information peppered in.\n\n5) Saturation is a combination of driving the UTA pres, clipping the line input of the console, and trimming things back with the faders. Might\u2019ve been an LA-2a on the snare with no compression, just crapping out the tubes.\n\nSorry wish I woulda taken pictures of this session.

You simply line up the ref to your session and the vocal to the ref (the latter is 99% of time already done since they're bouncing from the same session).

    "content": "I started getting serious about recording while I was in college (studying chemistry). I was playing bass in a band at the time and I was the only one that had any sort of decent recording equipment. I found myself being the guy recording all of the band's demos before we went into a 'proper studio'. Eventually, we realized my demos were sounding better than the ones we paid other people to record! Meanwhile, I started assisting (for free) at a local small recording studio and met a really great mentor. The studio was small and its business was mostly weekend warrior type stuff \u2013 nobody really notable. That being said, it was a working studio \u2013 and booked almost 6-7 days a week. The producer was the big fish in the small pond and had a great repeat clientele. Most of the music was not my cup of tea \u2013 but this proved to be a good thing as I was exposed to all sorts of different styles and it allowed me to be comfortable in genres of music which I normally wouldn't gravitate towards. It just made me comfortable around music and musicians in general.\n\nOnce I graduated and decided I wasn't going to use my chemistry degree, I ended up helping the producer build a bigger studio complex from the ground up. I learned an insane amount of stuff during this period \u2013 whether it was researching which Pro Tools system we would need to helping design the wiring layout to actually implementing it all. Ultimately, after months of hard work (and lots of borrowed money) the studio was complete and it was ready for business. I worked here for 2 years or so until I got introduced to Eric Valentine through former Street To Nowhere guitarist Matt Radosevich in Los Angeles. He needed a new full-time assistant and so I hopped at the opportunity and moved to LA \u2013 leaving behind the studio and crew I helped build (they're still going today and they're doing great).",

When the low end is just barely too thin it\u2019s actually perfect. \n\nTo me, the right monitoring is whatever you can mix 100% intuitively and then be satisfied far more often than not when listening on other systems. \n\nSo, In short:\n\n-are you able to mix intuitively and not be shocked by what the mix sounds like outside of the studio?",

If the monitoring is truly good, when you listen to your favorite records you\u2019ll be able to hear things in a fresh way, sometimes details you\u2019ve never noticed will jump out.  \n\nAnd then when you go back to your record you should be able to hear the distance between the two things fairly quickly. Things like low end, transient response, reverb tails, midrange detail (or lack thereof if you make metal) etc. \n\nSometimes just the fact that you can *hear* things makes you feel like it sounds good, but the key is to know what \u201cgood\u201d is for each case.",

    "content": "I'm going to take a stab but it's a little picky on the terminology and it's long-winded:\n\nUsually working with a mixer is like driving down a one way street in terms of file swapping.  You typically bring in a mixer when your song and production is fully complete, you've made it the best version of itself you could reach on your own but still want to bring in someone with more experience to help you take it to that next level of polish.  So typically in this version of a client/mixer relationship you probably wouldn't ever ask for the multitrack post-edit without some sort of unique circumstance that you'd be communicating with them directly.\n\nIt sounds to me in your other conversations here that in your case, the mixer is really filling a engineering/additional production role in your project.  They are taking files of yours before they can see the entire picture of the song and helping shape the tones, doing the editing, and managing the files for you as you submit more pieces to them over time.  In this type of working relationship files are typically shared in a two way street style.  You both are collaborating and working together toward the finish line.  This role is not something I would call a mixer though - they may still do your final mixes but they are also acting as an engineer or even producer.\n\nI know this is being a little semantic but I think it's important because the context changes how you can describe it as customary or not.\n\nAs always, you'll need to chat directly to them and explain a bit why you want to get those edited multitracks back.  My first assumption sadly if I were in your buddy's shoes is that you weren't happy with the work and wanted to send those files to someone else.  So if that's the case, let them know early, and if that's not the case, let them know why you want the files.",

Always always better to work this out ahead of time. And even if you get them to credit you now, it's likely too late. I have a credit coming up that I secured after the physical manufacturing had already begun. So it's too late for physical and will therefore not likely appear on allmusic. Will it appear Spotify/etc.? Who knows. On the plus side I can say with no hesitation that I worked on it, but it can definitely be a bit of a missed the boat situation.",

There are particular compressors that automatically suck low or high end out of the signal... and for something like bass that can occupy a very crucial part of the low end, that could prove problematic. Usually if I'm compressing bass, it's to bring out the sustain of the low end. So I'll typically set the release & the makeup gain first first to a place where I like how the low end is holding out, then dial in the attack to taste (usually on the medium-to-slow side). Grabby compression on bass can be fun in very specific instances, but I often find it distracting and fatiguing.",

I'm not someone who interacts with many kids on a regular basis, but I've felt a similar openness and lack of inhibition during my experiences doing improv comedy. It has so much in common with what we observe in children. Finding your way back to that state of non-judgement is such a worthy pursuit.\n\nImprov education places such an emphasis on not being precious about things, accepting what's happening in front of you, and not overthinking. Most of all, the biggest lessons were always about *listening*: Listening to your partners, listening to their intent, and listening to the audience. There is no time to plan. You just do.\n\nI did it for two years and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. The improv mindset really enriches everything else in your life once you open yourself up to it.",

Electric guitar or synth.\n\nAlso, I use mono -> stereo reverbs a lot because when I was learning, I used the Lexicon PCM-70 a lot which was mono input.

    "content": "Noah covered a lot, but a few (also stream of consciousness) thoughts to add:\n\nThere is no formula to when to take the leap. It's helpful to have some money in the bank, because it's going to take awhile for things to start happening. The more connections you have, the more in-roads you've made, the easier it will be to drum up work in music and keep the lights on. The less responsibilities and overhead you have, the easier the beginning stages of freelance life will be.\n\nDon't think about your music career in terms of the same metrics as your day job, you're burnt out on it for a reason. So instead of \"am I making what I made before,\" think \"can I survive on this for now?\" and if not, \"what will get me to a place that I can afford to pursue this dream?\"\n\nAny music job can be a boon for your career, and chances are you don't know where the opportunities will come from. The Beatles became the Beatles by playing cover songs at shady clubs, honing their sound and learning to play with each other. For someone else, that would've been a mindless, thankless gig with no upside. When they started playing better gigs, they were ready and stood out because of it.\n\nHow you do anything is how you do everything - if you're an intern at a studio cleaning up trash, you may be around huge artists and engineers. If they see you as dependable, friendly, going above-and-beyond, there's a tiny chance that a life-changing opportunity could emerge. Likewise, if they see you doing a sloppy job, that's how they're going to assume you'd be in the room, too.",

The idea that one person plays all the drums in one coordinated set all at once is a pretty narrow part of the whole of drumming, percussion, rhythm, etc. \n\nThere are SO many cool and interesting ways to make \"drums\" happens.\n\nI would spend some time with some of these records that people are sharing, and thinking about ALL the rhythmic components, both separately and together. \n\nTake some time, be patient, and try to expand your brain in how you think about this stuff.

    "content": "Not a question, but an attempt to give something back. Over the last 7 years of engineering in studios of all kinds on a wide variety of projects, I've built up a bunch of recall notes + photos / tips that I picked up, all gathered in Evernote. Some of them will be audible in commerical recordings. I've wanted to formalise them to share in some way for a while, so I'm wondering if the people here can suggest the most useful and accessible way to do that.\n\nIn a perfect world I'd do YouTube videos for them all, but I just don't have time to commit to that. A reasonable tradeoff might be to build out a reference section on my website (what I've been calling... The Cookbook), and leave it there for ever more for people to pilfer from.\n\nWhat say ye?",

For example - if I print a group of stems on THE SAME RENDER then they tend to sum with each other correctly/sample accurately.  It seems in my case to be if I'm printing stems one at a time, then one print may sometimes be offset 1 sample.  So if you are printing multitrack drums, try and print them together, or at the very least, load them into another DAW or a clean session and make sure they are adding back up like you expected ESPECIALLY for parallel processing.\n\nThe main takeaway here should be if you are sending files to another person to work on them you should always check your work so what goes out is what you expected to have go out!",

Start there, even if it's as simple as telling a different story with your chords over eight bars versus four bars.\n\nPlay with the harmonic rhythm of your chord changes. Some very basic examples:\n1. Instead of a single chord every measure, alternate between one chord per measure and two chords per measure.\n2. Hold on a single chord for six measures and then do a cadence with a quick succession of chords on bars seven and eight.\n3. Take your progression and play it at half the speed (a four bar progression becomes an eight bar progression).\n\nI know you said you're just making beats right now, but chords or a melody are going to inform and motivate your \"players\" and show them what to do. There needs to be some \"meat\" to the song for them to react to. If you don't like the melody you can mute it later. But give your \"players\" something to react to.",

    "content": "Of course depends on the tempo, part, sound of the drums, aesthetic of the track - but a few things that have worked in different scenarios for me:\n\nCreate the impression of some distance to walls by sending snare (start there, maybe add other mics) to a short stereo delay. Often something like 90ms on one side, 120ms on the other. Feel it out on one side, then add some time to the other.\n\nTry adding some fake distance to your existing room mics with a simple delay with no feedback (there\u2019s a Steve Albini drum video on YouTube where he demonstrates this). You can delay both sides equally, or solo one side, delay it til it feels good/sounds cool, then do the other. Anything from 12ms-around 23 seems to work. From there things start to become more like a slap, but than can be cool too.\n\nSmash up your existing rooms a bit, or a lot. Omnipressor, Devil Loc, UAD Zener, decapitator, Rough Rider (free), Arousor/Distressor in nuke, Lo-Fi. \n\nSend to a gated verb - Cian shared a drum session a while back with a short VintageVerb preset that\u2019s often useful. RMX16 Non-Lins can be good too, although it\u2019s easy to bring things into 80s territory this way.\n\nSend to a short room verb like ocean way, SP2016, Pro-R, Valhalla Room, Raum. Sometimes from close mics, sometimes from overheads, sometimes just slapping it straight on room mics. A little distortion (Decapitator, Devil Loc) after is often helpful.\n\nWith all of these solutions, the thing that seems to help them gel with the rest of the real kit is drum bus processing - compression and/or saturation.",

I've been playing with this effect for about 25 years and even yesterday had an artist at the house where we did vocal takes at different distances from the mic. never stop experimenting and learning!",

Nowadays, in the computer, it's less important and just comes down to workflow. Sometimes some mixes call for a more uniform reverb to tie tracks together... in this case putting it on a send makes more sense.

Usually starting with bass, guitars, keys and finally vocals. Some people do vocals first \u2014 that\u2019s never worked for me. Once you have a balance of the track, you can start really incorporating some of the overheads and room mics to give the drums more dimension and flavor. If the engineer really fucked the dog with the recording \u2014 or the room just sounds bad \u2014 I won\u2019t spend too much time making them work\u2026 I\u2019ll just get to manufacturing something that sounds cool. This could be leaning into a spring reverb, or a fun delay, or using other creative reverbs to get the drums have the space you want. I\u2019m a big fan of un-natural sounding drums\u2026 distorted spring reverb panned hard left with a slap panned hard right? Why not! If someone serves you shit, shovel them ice cream.\n\nToms will literally be the last thing I work on. It\u2019s just a matter of seeing what\u2019s missing from the overall picture and filling in the blanks with the spot mics. I don\u2019t like to trim the regions because I might find that when I\u2019m gating, some of the bleed sounds good from the track. Sometimes, if the engineer did their job, the multi-mic recording will be really complete and will need the tom mics for the overall sound\u2026 so no gating at all. Again, all depends on what you\u2019re working with.\n\nOnce I move on with the rest of my mix, I\u2019ll find myself doing EQ moves on the drum buss and treating it more like one instrument to get other things happening in the mix\u2026 only doing small tweaks to the individual sounds.\n\nI hope this all makes sense?",

If you have a kick drum panned dead center coming in at -6dB on your digital meter it's going to be coming in at -6 in both the L channel and -6 in the R channel. Each channel has it's own independent headroom that doesn't affect the other (until we add a limiter with linked channels), so let's simplify things a bit and mute the R channel for now:\n\nNow you have your L channel with the kick panned \"center\" and the R channel is muted.  If you were to pan this kick to the hard left it would not affect the volume of the L channel at all. That's because the panning effect is created by subtracting gain from the R channel only. Making the kick sound like it's leaning to the left.\n\nNow there's one big element I've left out so far, and that's *pan law*. Ableton Live has a -3dB pan law. This means that sounds panned to the center are reduced by 3dB. Because if a sound is being played at the same volume by both the L and R channels then their voltage will combine to create a sound that is louder than intended. So all DAWs and mixers compensate for this added loudness by turning down the gain of sounds as they are panned closer to the center (and shared between both speakers).\n\nSince all modern DAWs and mixers have pan laws implemented, what happens when you now pan the kick hard left is that it ends up becoming 3dB louder than it was when it was panned in the center, because it is no longer being turned down by the pan law when it\u2019s centered.",

Speaker cables in particular do not use the common as shielding where unbalanced line level (like consumer RCA) and instrument level cables do. \nBalanced signaling like mics and pro audio line level equipment requires a \"hot\" signal, a \"cold\" signal (either polarity inverted hot or just nothing but with the same source impedance), and a common (ground/shield). At the receiving end of the connection, there is what's called a differential amplifier. Short version, a differential amp polarity inverts cold and combines it with hot, thereby reducing common mode noise by cancellation (and also some distortion, but we'll get back to that later).",

The first thing that stands out to me is that you're using a soft ratio. You need to crank that ratio up to at *least* a 4:1 ratio, but you might be even better off with an 8:1 or higher ratio. You need a high ratio to get the deeper ducking effect that it seems you're seeking.\n\nUsing a soft ratio will never get you a big duck unless you have the threshold pulled all of the way down.

I don\u2019t do it all the time but sometimes it can really help to clear a few mixes that seem a bit finicky ( if you\u2019re looking to speed up your overall turnover). I\u2019m sure others have said it, but taking an ear break from one mix to prep your next , and maybe work on a specific technical issue in another (clip gaining esses for example ) ...can just help me not get bogged down and always moving through the to do list",

But that's on an ideal day for me - more often it's just getting excited about something I heard, getting an idea, and playing around with the mix a lot.  I'm pretty early on in the journey with mixing relatively but realized I was getting burned out already if I didn't continue experimenting and playing around with a song the way I did when I first got interested in this in the first place.  Usually trying new things on every single mix because I have the luxury of usually not being up against the clock working on indie releases.",

I think Prophet 5 wins out on raw tone from the oscillators, but the 6 is 90% of that flavor with a much more modern filter.  They added vintage mode a couple years back which really helped it step even closer to the Prophet 5/10, and the modern features like the Arp, Sequencer, and on board effects as well as that very sick analog distortion circuit make it a lot more versatile for sound design (within the Prophet tonescape obviously).\n\nI'm still in the honeymoon phase with mine but I'm glad I went with a P6 personally.  A lot more viable as a performance instrument and it can also get very very very close to the P5/P10 sounds if you keep it dry and keep the filter closed a bit more.\n\nThe only thing the P6 doesn't do that the P5/P10 can that I wish it could is the way it does voice allocation in non-unison modes - I believe it always steps through round-robin with voices, whereas the P5/P10 retriggers the same voice for the same key until you move away from that key.  Not a huge deal since you can use Unison 1 voice for basses if you want to retrigger the same voice each time.",

There are a lot of reasons that an Apollo might be a good investment, but buying them for the converters probably isn't the best use of your money at this stage.\n\nThe difference that converters will make (if any) is very very small compared to other factors. Factors like having a good room to listen in, acoustic treatment for the room, and the monitors you're listening through. I would prioritize those and consider converters to be very low priority until you get those other factors working well.\n\nSo unless there are other reasons that you'd like to have an Apollo I think you can save your money for the time being.",

    "content": "When Jon receives a song to mix, there is almost always a lot of compression on the individual stems, especially drums and vocals. So he does more subtle moves to bring out the best in each mix. If you're recording stuff yourself, you will likely want to add a lot of compression to get the same modern, perceived loudness.\n\nThe fundamental thing to know is that \"compression\" simply means \"reducing the dynamic range\" (aka \"compressing\" the range of volume of your sound ). This can be achieved with \"compressors\" as well as \"limiters,\" \"saturators,\" \"clippers,\" \"distortion,\" and a number of other types of effects that do it in different ways (and may add other sonic characteristics to your sound).",

All so I could work at the speed of my creativity focusing on parts & performance rather than capture & sonics. \n\nAbout 5 years in I was fast and savvy enough that I could let the Sonics play a bigger role without sacrificing momentum, so last year I installed a patch bay. Now just grabbing a mic to record takes a little longer, but I can do a lot more fun & creative work on the way in. \n\nSo even if you decided to go 500 series, I\u2019d argue that the modularity isn\u2019t as big of a selling point on a microcosmic level. \n\nIt might be worth thinking about the 500 series like a console, get yourself 8 Avedia Ma5s and do all your eq & compression in the box.",

They can sometimes be a bit hybrid in their sound and form factor. So again, just put your hands on the guitar, if you can, and see how it feels/sounds to you. If it sounds good and it feels good it is good.",

Could it yield some fun effects? Maybe?! I'm sorta with Matt... if you're already in the computer, and unless you're sending out to something with a shitton of tubes or transformers, you're probably best staying in the box. Some 'pre-amps' that I do come out of the box for distortion on a regular basis are: Ampex 351 (god bless this thing) and the Scully 280. But I'm looking for real distortion that I'm typically using in parallel, nothing subtle. I use Spectre/Saturn/Decapitator/Neutron for that stuff.",

Like @Rollmottle says, you want the live tracks to be predictable and consistent and whoever is handling the tracks should ensure that they're level-matched relative to each other. You want to do your best to ensure that the live tracks are all reaching the live engineer at a consistent and unwavering level, so that they aren't getting any curveballs from the person running the tracks.",

    "content": "Process/Theory:\nI see lots of people\u2019s previous responses say they begin with getting the overheads to sound great and then start blending in close mics. If the drums were recorded by someone who knew what they were doing, with a good sounding kit, in a nice room \u2014 this would be a wonderful way to approach things. However 90% of the time that\u2019s not the case with tracks that come my way. So I\u2019m solving fro two problems \u2014 making the drums:\n1) The foundational rhythm element. It doesn\u2019t matter how good tonally your drums sound, they need to fill specific duties to carry the rhythm of the song. This is usually problem solving with phase within the elements of the drum set and then mostly getting the kick and snare to sit right around the rest of the instruments. Literally getting the right transients in the right frequency ranges \u2014 agnostic of \u2018tone\u2019 and \u2018vibe\u2019.\n2) The sense of space for the mix. The drums are a huge part of this\u2026 and the foundation for the aesthetic of a mix. Is it a tight space? Big verby snare? This is all great, but will rarely deal with this stuff until #1 is taken care of. So my process starts with close mics.\n\nAfter poking around and listening to the close mic various options to get a sense of what I\u2019m working with, I\u2019ll start with getting everything in phase. Solo the kick drum mics and get those in phase with each-other. If they don\u2019t add up, I\u2019ll start playing with HP filters at various Q\u2019s to try and get things closer. You\u2019d be surprised what you can get away with even when things are even 90 degrees out. Then, I\u2019ll start introducing more spot mics (snare, toms, HH) and start getting things in focus with just phase flips. By the time you get to the overheads and rooms, you should have all the spot mics in phase with each-other so then you can get a better sense of how the overheads are going to play into the game.",

As far as taking up more headroom, there's just too many variables to figure out there.

However because this also makes the sound perceptually louder you\u2019re likely to turn the sound down a little bit to compensate for the boost in volume, thus buying you back the headroom you\u2019d have lost.\n\nI may have missed a few things.

    "content": "I agree mostly with this! I\u2019ve been playing instruments for 20 years and have made a living from it. If you want to get good, it is aactually pretty easy and anyone can do it with the right mindset and patience(key word here). Firstly stop playing on and off, just play as often as you can preferably every day if not every other day.  Stop worrying about scales chords and theory, and just play. Learn as many songs as you can, like really learn them. Your ear will get better at picking up details, like groove and technique over time, so just learn the songs as good as you can and then move one to the next. Try and make it through a 1000 songs over the next few years. You don\u2019t need to remember them, just get through them and move on. You will pretty quickly start recognising patterns in music and realise most music is made up of the same few combinations of chords notes and so on. At this point I would recognise learning some theory, so that you will be able to name those musical patterns be it cadences, notes, chords, extensions and so on.  Then depending on what with your playing. This next bit is super important. If you don\u2019t care about playing in bands or performing for people then you can do this whole thing by your self. But if you want to play with real people on a stage or a basement then you need to spend time playing with people as much as you can. Learn some songs go to a jam session either at a local pub, church or what ever you have in your city. Having friends who play is also great as you might be able to get a chance to play with them regularly, maby even make a band. When learning a song, make sure you can play it all the way through with either a metronome or a drum track before moving on. Video taping also helps to be able to get an objective look/listen to your playing so you will know, what you need to be mindful of. \n\nKeith Jarrett the pianist learned one 1000 songs the first year for a restaurant piano gig before he was known or good.",

    "content": "I love (trying) to explain this because it always makes me think of new things to try.\n\nYou can stereoize a sound using lots of techniques, the main three being pitch, delay, and phase. Often times your favorite plugins will do combos of these, so flipping the phase on one side will sometimes kill some of your wideness.\n\nIt's worth doing a google, but something like a flanger is simply duplicating the signal and micro delaying one of them at a variable rate. So the duplicated signal might oscillate between 2-20 milliseconds, which makes that crazy flanger sound. If you take that duplicated signal and run it through an aggressive filter (which will introduce some phase shift) and that's what a phaser is. \n\nYou can play with multiple duplicate signals, flipping phase on one side and getting wild effects. You can play with pitch on the delayed signal and start getting an effect we call \"chorus.\" But of course, each of these types of effects are just combinations of fundamental ways to manipulate audio. Many combos are possible!\n\nHooray sound design!\n\nAlso, I would love @Slow Hand to correct and expand, since I know he (and many others on here) are REAL sound design nerds.",

The verb may already be de-correlating the L/R channels (making them different from each other) in the optimal amount.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that different frequencies will likely have different amounts of phase rotation from the dry input signal, so flipping the polarity on one channel (left or right) might cause some frequencies to nullify and some to be accentuated. I wouldn't worry about trying to predict these relationships. It's all a mess by design. Use your ears and see what sounds good.",

It\u2019s easy to overdo it, and satisfying enough that sometimes you don\u2019t know in the moment.\n\nUltimately you can be 100% in the right speaker or 100% in the left speaker, and pushing beyond that is tempting the gods. As far as I can conceive it, any process that attempts to widen a signal that\u2019s already entirely decorrelated must have the potential to reintroduce some correlation. Thinking again of the ping pong delay, is there really anything wider than that?\n\nI was doing a lot of M/S mix buss widening stuff a few years ago, and I realized that it could do some pretty weird shit to panned vocals and the like. While it feels like you can just \u2018turn up the sides\u2019, you\u2019re really doing something unnatural to the center, too, and the relationship between channels. Like you\u2019re choosing select bits of a sound to turn up, but only the bits of that sound that don\u2019t have anything in common with the other speaker. This is a lot of rambling just to say that there\u2019s clearly a point of diminishing returns, and maybe the solution is to pan something else less wide to create contrast.",

    "content": "Are you looking for resources on writing/production, or mixing? Just like with the record side, there's so much noise from bedroom composers and people that have zero real-world experience. And as Ruairi is always saying, even the people with real success often can't teach what they know. Maybe I'm a bit cranky after an 8 hour delay at the airport yesterday, but Spitfire has gotten quite good at creating \"tutorial\" videos that are thinly veiled advertisements, and many of their libraries are the equivalent of one-knob plugins or CLA vocals. Selling paint-by-numbers solutions to na\u00efve kids who want to get into scoring (They're far from the only ones guilty of this). But to focus on some of the channels I think are actually worth their salt:\n\n8-Bit Music Theory: https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory/videos\nCan be a bit basic at times, but he talks a lot about structure which, IMO, is becoming a lost art in modern scoring.\n\nAnne-Kathrin Dern: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJg1w7F3PKPbSpEF2YOejVjWAg-KcM3Z\nNot the biggest name out there, but she has a no-bullshit way of explaining things about orchestration and theory that is clear and concise. As far as \"teachers,\" I think she's a good one.\n\nAlan Meyerson Waves Sessions: https://youtu.be/h9jZqn5lnw4\nI hesitate to include this. I know for a fact that Alan swapped out a bunch of his go-to plugins to make everything a Waves product. I haven't watched this in awhile, but it's a good insight into how he sets up a big mix session and why he makes some of his decisions. He's also playing to the camera/audience some, so this is a your-mileage-may-vary recommendation.\n\nMcGowen Soundworks: https://www.youtube.com/@McGowanSoundworks/featured\nPhil knows his shit, and goes pretty deep breaking down a few actual mixes, which is pretty rare to find.\n\nIf I think of others, I'll report back. Hope that helps",

Just enough of a dip on the sustained note so the focus shifts to the incoming line, and the lyrics are intelligible, but without making the first line trail off (unless that\u2019s the desired effect).\n\nI think of those musicals where there\u2019s a big chorus and everyone\u2019s singing different counter lines on top of one another. It\u2019s like a chaotic puzzle, but what you realize is that the lyrics to the counter lines are all lines you\u2019ve heard earlier in the show. So your brain can fill them in without really listening, and the arranger\u2019s job is to use a spotlight to continually move your focus to the most important melody at any given moment.",

Haven\u2019t seen you around these parts yet so I don\u2019t know your situation and can\u2019t speak to your specifics. But, there are some overarching philosophical ideas worth considering. \n\n1) the answer to each of these questions is different for every person. None of us got into music because we\u2019re risk averse and looking for stability, so dont think just cause you\u2019re \u201cgoing full time\u201d or you start calling it a \u201ccareer\u201d that somehow that will be different. \n\n2) and this is universally true, you\u2019ll never be younger or have fewer responsibilities than you do now.\n\n3) don\u2019t take the leap if you\u2019re not willing to: be poor. Have roommates. Eat ramen. Breakup with girlfriends/boyfriends who expect more from you. Borrow money for your cellphone bill. Drive a shitty car. Etc etc. \n\nBut also, if you don\u2019t bet on yourself, no one else is going to either.",

One major leson ive learnt here (thats making me better) is that the engioneering path is long and some users here are very far along it. Ive felt like a doughnut many times here reflecting on previous engineering ideas i might have advocated. Dont worry about it...its the fun of the ride...one minute you feel like you know it all....then you realise you dont know but a tiny slice of it.

My personal goal, is to get the sound to be as awesome and huge and perfect with 1 pair of guitar tracks doubled, with 1 mic on an amp. That\u2019s the ideal scenario for me. That said There are people that sum 4 mics down to 1 signal on a mixer and it sounds amazing.  \n\n2. The more performances  you add of the same part, the more blurry it will sound.if you need different textures, consider recording a DI so it can be blended in with your amp in any manner of your choice, either reamping, distorting with a plugin, whatever. (Check phase)\n\n3. I like when the left and right are *subtly* different, no drastically different. You hear \u201cthe left and right being different is what makes something wide\u201d\nThis is true. But I loathe when it\u2019s so different it feels lopsided.\n\nHow do we address this? \n\n-double track using the same guitar so the tuning and intonation is most similar \n\n-change the amp head but keep the same cabinet/speaker so the overall EQ is similar but my the gain structure is different\n\nIf you use 2 different guitars, consider the scale lengths. This will change subtle intonation things, for better or worse.",

I\u2019d rather split that up if it\u2019s an option for the singer but if it\u2019s a live take you have to do whatever is necessary to make it sound great. Sometimes attenuating the output gain. Sometimes  i have my hands on the compressor input and output and I\u2019m attenuating both. I like a 176 compressor for this as it\u2019s  very forgiving in gain reduction. If I can\u2019t manage any of the above I mult the vocal and have one safety track with the gain trimmed to a safe spot",

My additional complicating factor is having a laptop that is a dupe of the studio rig, so keeping it all straight and everything in sync is a bit of a puzzle. \n\nI took the transition as the opportunity to phase out some mechanical drives so I had to get some new drives for the M4 instead of re-using the old Time Machine mechanical drive. The M4 mini only has Thunderbolt/USB C ports -- the M1 has USB A's and Thunderbolt/USB C's so I needed a TB hub to get my old USB hub to play on the M4. The move forced me to sort out my iLok strategy between my mastering rig and my production rig because it was quite messy (I ended up getting a 2nd iLok for the M4 to make things way easier between it and the laptop). It was just a lot of little stuff for me. If you're not changing machine form factors and it's mostly a software exercise, then it might be worth it.",

So for those who have been using tape for a long while or did back in the day, you can't just use any old reel after baking it for a project? or can you say, bake it, use it for the project (record 2 track mix to tape, etc) and then just store it and re-bake it and use it again for the next project? \n\nI didn't grow up with tape but I love the sound and find the whole process romantic, despite how much extra work calibrating tape machines and maintaining them and the unpredictable nature of tape.",

    "content": "When successful music producers talk about \"mentors,\" it's almost always working under someone. This usually starts out as an internship or assistant position of some sort. Some come through your network of music friends, some come from doing exceptional work and people further along in their career taking notice, and some come from applying to the various \"looking for an assistant with xyz qualifications\" posts you see here and on social media.\n\nI made an album with a local band called the Matches up in Oakland. They started getting attention from record labels and big producers in LA. I moved to LA and met Eric Valentine who liked the album and met with the band. I asked if I could intern for him. He said he didn't have interns but I should stay in touch cause sometimes they hired extra help. I called him every two weeks for the next six months until an opportunity opened up. Then I assisted him for five years while making indie records on the side.",

    "content": "My advice is to have in person interactions as much as possible. When it comes to making records at a super high level (intense, stressful, high standards, egos, deadlines, freakouts, etc), you need to build a level of trust that for me is impossible without spending time with a person.\n\nIt doesn't mean you can't build a career remotely, but it's harder. Not only is it harder to build trust, but the remote option is available to anyone with an internet connection. So you're competing with a much larger pool of people too.\n\nDoes that mean move to LA or London or Miami or wherever? Not necessarily. But finding a way to get in person with the kinds of people you want to work with is extremely important",

Then I'd pull up my snare mic. and it sounded...the same.  I found that if the snare sounds the same in the OH's and rooms as it does in the close mic, it ends up sounding smaller bc of phase or lack of variety.\n\nif you're using 16 drum channels and 8 of them sound the same, what's the point?\n\nThe OH's and rooms for me with that many microphones, i am trying to get width or energy. so the differences between the left and right is what makes it sound big and immersive, and let's the snare mics be their own thing dead center. \n\nNow, if I am doing a 1-5 mic setup, I will concern myself more with all of that stuff and try to get the snare to sound really great and centered.",

If the mix is such that you're taking off a lot of transients on the master buss, it may sound better to ease off the limiter or bypass it entirely so that the live sound engineer will have plenty of headroom to work with and isn't trying to mix around a track that's massively limited. Having that extra headroom and transient energy could be a benefit, thought you'll have to use your ears to make that judgement, and definitely talk to the artist.",

    "content": "The point of the test pressing isn't to pick one, it's more of a sanity check on the vinyl master.  I would always recommend an acetate to avoid the pain in the ass of discovering a problem with your master at test pressing. The acetate precedes the sign off on the master and allows you to hear what your music MIGHT sound like on a record. It is definitely lesser quality than a test pressing and a full vinyl run, but the $80 or $100 it costs will be money well spent to avoid a wasted cycle and cost of a bunk test-pressing.",

Maybe that is the goal?\n\nNot trying to criticize at all, I know whoever is making this knows what they\u2019re doing 100%, but curious if anyone can explain techniques and goals from a OH setup like this.",

    "content": "I would tell them there's a few things to consider when pressing vinyl:\n1) Mastering is especially important as it\u2019s the real bridge between the music and the mechanical production of the record. I had the great pleasure of mastering a few records for vinyl with Doug Sax (give him a google) and there\u2019s a lot more to the process than modern mastering for digital services. They will actually cut the acetate disc which will be what manufacturers use to make the metal stamper that actually molds the records. A lot of thought goes into this process such as the width of the grooves to accommodate bass frequencies, etc. If you want a good sounding record, there\u2019s no way around working with a seasoned professional.\n\n2) Side lengths are important, as is track order. The more music you put on a side of vinyl, the less fidelity it will have as a whole. There will be sacrifices in the manufacturing to accommodate all of the music, so it\u2019s best to keep your side lengths under 20 mins. Closer to 15 mins per side is ideal sonically, but sometimes that means doing double records and that just gets expensive. Also the order in which the tracks play on each side plays a part. The songs at the beginning of the side have more bandwidth and less distortion\u2026 it basically diminishes the closer you get to the center. Whatever the last track on the side is will just sound worse. It\u2019s a flaw in the medium\u2026 so think about that.",

    "content": "Template:\nI\u2019ve attached a slimmed down version of my mix template with all of the drum bussing. This has evolved over many years and has taken many forms, but it\u2019s really just a good starting point for me and speeds up my workflow quite a bit. I\u2019ve got three main busses that feed into a master drum buss. \u2018DRUM SUB\u2019 is my uncompressed (or lightly compressed) buss. \u2018DRUM PAR\u2019 is my heavily compressed buss, and \u2018DRUM DIST\u2019 is my parallel distortion buss. I don\u2019t necessarily always use these, but having them ready to go makes it easier to quickly audition different ideas. Sometimes I\u2019ll duplicate one or two of them to get another flavor involved. Again, everything to taste. \n\nAlso in the template are some very basic aux\u2019s I find myself using often. There are two parallel SansAmp busses. I have two because often times if I use one on the kick drum, it rarely works for the snare drum, so I have a second one ready to go. There\u2019s also a \u2018SNARE SLAP\u2019 and \u2018SNARE GATE VERB\u2019 that rarely get used but if I need to inject a little mojo, they\u2019re a good starting point.\n\nThe \u2018D SUB TRIM\u2019 is just a master fader controlling everything going into the bussing, so if I get a little overzealous with level, I can manage the gain staging quickly without having volume automation grouped. These three (sometimes more) busses then feed into the final \u2018DRUM MSTR\u2019 , where I\u2019ll do final overall EQ tweaks and level adjustments.",

    "content": "I'll gate everything with the Pro-G. Usually as tight as I can while sometimes automating threshhold to make sure ghostnotes don't get lost. I'll peel back the ratio once I have everything triggering properly to let some bleed in to taste. Sometimes I'll only gate 2-3 dB to just get something to pop. Sometimes its in a vaccum.\nI will very rarely compress individual drum mics. And I pray that the recording engineer didn\u2019t either. I like most of my compression to come from the busses. It sounds more natural to my ear and allows you to get away with a more compressed, exciting sound than just whacking the close mics. I\u2019ll find at the beginning my drum mixes will be very \u2018pokey\u2019 \u2014 I want each drum to sound explosive and over the top. That way when i start compressing them, they maintain their transient quality when they start getting dynamically reduced.\n\nI\u2019m always cutting tons of 250-350 out of the kick drums and trying to manufacture any attack with saturation instead of EQ. Having a SansAmp or a Saturn plugin adding high end always sounds more natural to me than just additive EQ. I\u2019m always very wary of the 2-5khz region, and find even-order harmonics are the best bet to fill in the blanks there.\n\nI tend to like my snare drums warm, so often low-shelving down the super low end and keeping the 150-300 \u2018boosh\u2019 intact. I try to avoid using HPF on drum mics because at this point, things should be relatively in phase, so if I put a filter on, it\u2019s going to throw the whole kaboodle off whack. Shelves are your friend here. And same as with the kick drums re: adding high end \u2014 I\u2019m wary off adding the snap in the 2-5khz range, I\u2019ll try and have the body of the snare drum really singing so I only have to add a little bit of top end, often above 5khz just for some air.",

I like the distortion buss technique because if offers a consistency across all the tracks and you dont just have a distorted snare drum but pristine clean toms. Often its a Decapitator with a low shelf going into it killing some low end. I\u2019ll solo this buss, get it to sound crunchy but not messy, then un-solo, bring the fader to neg-infinity, and blend it into taste. You\u2019d be surprised how much excitement you get without totally fucking up the aesthetic of the drums.\n\nAs for samples? Sure! I\u2019ve you\u2019ve gone all-balls on these tracks and you\u2019re still lacking what you think you need, then no shame in supplementing with samples. \u2018Supplement\u2019 being the key word here. I use the Massey DRT to extract MIDI from the kick & snare mics and then use Battery to trigger my samples. I have a few samples that just solve various problems for me. Sometimes just giving me the low end sub, or a 100 cycle knock. They can be helpful to punch your way through phasing issues and really get the meat and potatoes of the rhythm track holding its own. I will never \u2018replace\u2019 with a sample\u2026 there\u2019s always something useful in the recorded track if you try hard enough.",

I understand this from a frequency point of view. But when talking about mono vs wide sounds I\u2019m kinda lost. \n\nIf let\u2019s say i have 2 sounds, one is mono and one is wide.  Would that leave one with more headroom compared to having the same 2 sounds both in mono? \n\nOr would the wide sound take up more head room, because to make a sound wide, it needs to be different on both sides. But doesn\u2019t that mean that you would have double the amount of signal as you would need two different versions of the same sound playing at once to achieve wideness? \n\nFx a mono guitar and a mono vocal both centre vs a completely anti phase guitar and mono vocal. I know the latter will make each sound more intelligible but wouldn\u2019t you at the same time provide more information resulting in less headroom?",

This, alongside the chamber mics, seriously gave me goosebumps to listen to. \n\nHow are the overheads placed? They seem super wide and right over the cymbals but when you add the snare mic it all sounds perfect. \nIs all the saturation on each channel a product of driving the UTA preamps? I\u2019m amazed at how distorted they are when solo-ed and how much it allows them to punch through.\n\n\nSorry for my gushing, but this is just the coolest thing ever to me.

(This is in a perfect world where the beat is mixed perfectly and has the right amount of space for the vocal). I see this is how a lot of people are running sessions and how they are mixing demos, to either release or send out to mix & master.

Also with certain connections it may NOT work. \n\nYou probably know this, but active monitors just use balanced cabling with TRS or XLR connectors. Passive use proper speaker cables which are unshielded and TS.\n\nSpeaker cables don't have any shielding because they are expecting to see a super hot signal.  So this would result in unwanted noise in your guitar signal / active monitor signal because line level is much lower than speaker level.\n\nSo in all cases it's pretty much best to use the correct cable for the correct job.

Sorry if this is long, I\u2019m bad at short form.\n\nContext: I have been producing music in sincerity for maybe 3 years now, been a hobby since like 16. I\u2019ve started to engineer out of necessity for my individual artistry, but one thing led to the next and I gained a fair bit of skill at it (or so I\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m still pretty insecure, honestly even being around all the really knowledge people on here makes my panic disorder go \ud83d\udcc8). I\u2019ve gotten an internship at a studio as a runner and a session assistant down here (it\u2019s not paid but it\u2019s not exactly unpaid), and I truly have learned a lot (I learn something new on the daily I swear), but I\u2019ve yet to have any true guidance from an established figure yet (which very well may never happen), which I know isn\u2019t necessary, but it absolutely makes me question my own abilities/career decisions despite what happens with my freelance work and I\u2019m curious to know if this is like normal/how other people cope. \n\nLike, I\u2019ve gotten a somewhat okay share of people who pay for my work as an engineer/producer/writer, but the \u201cdo you really know what you\u2019re doing\u201d doubt doesn\u2019t fade easily\u2014even when I\u2019ve been paid by people on like label level budgets, I\u2019m never really registering that success. I\u2019ve had cool moments and landed spotify placements as a mixer for artists, and there\u2019s this part of me that\u2019s still somewhat ashamed that I do a lot more work for free than I care to admit. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the comments on the old episodes that has me spooked (Jon on #61 re: \u201cnot everyone can be a mixer\u201d), but is this like just me or do even some of the really wicked smart people here still feel that\u2014and if so, how do you guys handle the it?",

I think similar features are implemented in Intel systems depending on how you have your power settings set in the BIOS and OS (at least in Windows).  So counterintuitively if you aren't pushing your cores to the limit they won't be operating as effectively.  When I'm working on the Mac I keep the buffer as low as possible and then tick it up during the mix process, and on Windows my machine is usually really stable at 1024 from start to finish in a mix so I just leave it there, but I've also disabled any sort of power saving stuff on my PC in the BIOS so the clock speeds should be relatively stable.  Again, I'm not sure if this is actually the cause or not but just what I've seen posted about online anecdotally!",

So this should look really similar to the sidechain settings in the stock compressor.

With the stock Ableton plugins this happens automatically when you engage the sidechain but for 3rd party you have to add it manually.  I don't have F6 but looking up an image of the plugin it looks like the option is in the bottom right (2nd picture).\n\nIf that doesn't work then I'm not sure what's going wrong.",

    "content": "thanks! @Slow Hand & @oaklandmatt. \n\nSomething i've been noticing a lot lately is, when playing with width effects, i keep preferring, sticking to only one type of widening at a time, instead of combining. To me it achieves the \"clearest\" or most intentional result. For example, for some cool widening on guitar i could use a pingpong slap where one side is phase-flipped. It sounds huge and great, now let's say i also want to chorus it. For some reason it seems to loose some of the width or wow effect of the original widening technique. So i'll usually try a few different effect and see which one i prefer, and 9/10 it always achieves my preferred effect picking one, even tho i like the idea of combining, different techniques to sound \"unique\". The Diminishing returns seem to work against the sound i like in my earholes. I've noticed in a lot of sessions i've been given or been in, a lot of people seem to love adding a bajillion subtle widening things on their lead vocals and when ever i just choose one and turn it up, people usually ask what crazy voodoo i'm doing. \n\nThis is all in the context of widening a mono or less wide sound.",

Aliasing is caused by non linear processes like distortion, and dynamics processing (compressor or limiter). Lots online about what it is and why it happens but you can sum it up by saying it\u2019s an inharmonic, digital sounding hash that can feel bright but in a kind of ugly way (but remember sometimes ugly is good)\n- **Higher sample rates reduce the impact of Anti Imaging and Anti Aliasing filters in AD to DA converters.** Filtering is necessary for accurate capture and replay of analog signals, and it in the early days of digital it used to be a real challenge. Now it\u2019s basically a solved problem, but if you are doing acoustic music, with delicate transient information there is still a small but real advantage to higher rates\n- **Higher sample rates reduce overshoot and inter sample peaks on limiters.** This really only matters if you are sending your loud mixes directly to release, otherwise your mastering girl or guy should handle that",

    "content": "- **More samples (slices) per second equals a better representation of the analog waveform.** Within half the band of the sample rate (say up to 22.05k for 44.1k) this is demonstrably not true. I know that is confounding, but digital and information theory is basically miraculous\n- **We can hear/feel/sense sounds above 20k.** We truly really cannot and if you experiment with significant energy above 20k you\u2019ll actually see problems creep in for electronics and speakers etc. Information above 20k is not our friend (space for harmonic information to live without aliasing back excepted)\n- **Working at multiples of 44.1k is better because the sample rate conversion will work better.** This used to be a little bit true a long time ago but hasn\u2019t been for a long time. Use the SRC in iZotope RX on it\u2019s stock preset to 44.1 and you are in pretty good shape\n- **Digital EQs work better at higher sample rates because of cramping.** Cramping was an esoteric problem with older digital EQs that looked bad on analyzers but never actually sounded very bad. It\u2019s a solved problem nowadays with most EQs.\n- **Video and film is at 48k so we must start there.** Yes film and TV still work at 48k (although YouTube specs 44.1 now) but I have sent a million tracks for sync at 44.1 and it gets dropped in with SRC and away we go",

These \u2018devices\u2019 can be a plugin, a piece of hardware, an A/D/A converter, an auxiliary bus, a mix bus, etc.\n\nIn analog world\u2026 there might be fathomable difference when a compressor or amplifier receives -10dBVU vs +10 dBVU. Accounting for these differences would be considered gain staging \u2014 and you\u2019d be looking for what gets the ideal sound out of your box.\n\nIn digital world\u2026 some plugins may react similarly and others may not care if you\u2019re sending -6dBFS or -0.01dBFS. It\u2019s usually case by case as there are myriad plugins. You also need to consider what level the plugin is sending signal out \u2014 as this will affect how the next plugin processes the audio, or how much headroom it has to work with. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m sending signal out of a compressor plugin into an EQ plugin \u2014 and lets say I\u2019m using the compressor to beef up mean volume of the signal and then I want to EQ some more low end into the signal after the fact. Well, I\u2019m going to be adding gain in the compressor and then the level going into the EQ will be hotter than originally intended. Id want to trim down the output of the compressor (or the input of the EQ) so you have headroom to be able to boost those frequencies without clipping the output of the EQ. In a 32-bit floating mixer like Pro Tools, these issues become less audible as the mixer has higher headroom than its indicating, but you never actually know \u2014 and it\u2019s best to just stick to the parameters that you have control over. If you were to do this same function with an analog compressor and EQ, there would be very noticeable distortion if you didn\u2019t stage the gain properly.",

    "content": "Sometimes gain staging is just managing the signals going to an auxiliary bus or a master fader. If you\u2019ve got everything summing into - say - an aux bus in pro tools, and that aux bus is clipping, then that will be audible distortion going into the next gain stage. It may sound good, it probably doesn\u2019t \u2014 so its something to account for earlier down the chain. If you\u2019re going into a master fader in pro tools, and your signal is over 0dBFS, you can simply turn down the master fader, and it is actually turning down all the signals going to it, not just the output. This is useful because you can then throttle the input to your first plugin in the chain \u2014 say a limiter or maximizer. It\u2019d be a shame to have a fancy clipper on your master bus, only to be clipping the signal in the chain before even getting to it.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a scattershot answer to a scattershot question, but the reality is that everything affects everything in audio. And having your head wrapped around signals levels going in and out of things will help you make faster decisions and help you troubleshoot quickly when things aren\u2019t sounding quite right.",

    "content": "I wrote in my notes from the Bainz episode that the way each guest/mixer talks about gainstaging the various tracks of a mix, it definitely is the mixer\u2019s version of a \u201cbusiness mission statement,\u201d which @Slow Hand alludes to with the idea of talking about how one choice ripples to inform all of our other decisions. Gainstaging sets the record up to show off its best qualities\u2014and are those qualities in the low end of a booming bass synth and the natural silky quality of the vocalist, or maybe you want the mid range to feel really detailed yet cohesive and warm. \n\nUnderstanding this, for me, made the finishing process that Jon talks about make sense. Level setting inherently overlaps with the kind of decision making process of EQing, which is something you can probably understand best from this clip of Bainz talking about how he can get a vocal to be so upfront in his mixes because he\u2019s surgical in what he keeps in there. The way I understood it, he\u2019s cleaned up the vocal a ton, set the levels of his tracks by what feels important to bring to the forefront for the listener, and then he uses those levels to inform his EQ moves throughout.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CkSeHgrosyx/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=",

    "content": "Hey I've got a question for people who regularly use IG and FB to run ads:\n\nI'm a very light IG user and a long-gone FB user (10+ years without an account). I've recently had cause to begin experimenting with running Meta ads (my ultimate goal here). \n\nLong story short I cannot run the ads that I want without linking both my IG account and my (newly created) FB account that I created solely to fulfill the requirement that will allow me to create ads. The problem is I think I've somehow created **two** new FB accounts in the process and I think my IG account is linked to the wrong one in a way that makes it impossible for me to run ads or connect to the 2nd FB account that I suspect will allow the Meta Business Suite to function properly.\n\n**So my question is this:** Has anyone encountered similar problems with two Meta accounts that need to be unlinked and re-linked correctly? FB support has been no help because there are no support reps to contact and get someone on the phone to problem solve. Their support is nothing more than an extensive FAQ that I've plumbed and still can't find a solution. There are no human operators to speak with and I've been seeking an answer for a week now with no luck.\n\nI'm embarrassed to even be asking this because the process of running ads through Meta already runs counter to my personal convictions around online-tracking and such. So this cognitive dissonance on top of my current frustrations with the process is draining my resolve to solve this problem. Hence me asking this question here as a hail mary.",

So bear with me.\n\nSo I think I've somehow created two FB profiles.\n\nI have a FB profile that logs in using the same email address as my IG account. This FB account is devoid of content, except for a random photo of a houseplant that I set as my profile pic so that I could distinguish it from what I believe to be a separate FB account that is also paired to my Meta Business Suite account.\n\nThe reason I think I have two FB accounts is because when I log into the Meta Business Suite it has thumbnails for all of the linked accounts: My IG account (represented with my IG profile pic) and my FB account which is has a blank default profile image. Not the houseplant profile image on my 2nd FB account that I setup.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but I was able to post a \"test post\" to my \"blank\" FB account and in certain windows within the Meta Business Suite I can see that that test post was successfully posted to the timeline. However, on my \"houseplant\" FB profile the test post doesn't appear. So I feel confident that these are two separate profiles.\n\nNeedless to say the whole thing is perplexing and I cannot find the means to distinguish one from the other. I see one FB profile through the Meta Business Suite and I see the other FB profile when I log in through the FB website. It's a mess. \ud83e\udd26",

This all makes sense. \n\nThe monitoring the repro-head and recording back to digital all in one step note: This is what I am curious about. There's an Otari MX5050 at the studio that I want to mess around with and we have tons of tapes around the studio i'm sure i could use. \n\nSO, Can you sort of passively have the tape machine going without having to operate it actively and just use pro tools, all while getting the tape sound? Like a hardware insert or simply bringing it in and monitoring? \n\nI didn't grow up with Tape, but I want to explore the sounds because so many of my fav sounding records used tape. Many also DIDN'T, but I feel like i've got to figure this out for myself.",

You probably got feedback because input channel 4 in the Evo software is turned up on output 3+4 mix.  If you only plan to use outputs 3+4 for hardware loops, make sure Mac 3 and Mac 4 are turned up to unity (0) and Mac 1+2 are turned all the way down, and I\u2019d turn down all the mic inputs  so you don\u2019t create any feedback loops.\n\nIf that\u2019s all set up correctly I\u2019m stumped for now!",

I\u2019m also a CB/teezio fan and one of the rnb/trap engineers on here , so I\u2019d consider myself pretty familiar with Bainz and teezios general workflows having studied their work a bit myself . I\u2019ve not been in the same room as them as the mods you\u2019ve been speaking to have tho  , and beyond these shows the screen videos \u2026\u2026I believe Matt\u2019s LWMR vids with teezio and Bainz are more insightful with respect to the why , rather than the what \u2026..\nHappy to chat on all this with you , and if necessary help you to feel like you\u2019ve built a voxal chain you\u2019re happy wirh for these genres",

Choose an emotion/mindset and embody that as the player: melancholy, furious, chaotic, childlike, meek.\n\nInstrumental fills every few bars.\nTake a solo. A short one.\nMake some noise!\n\nListen to your song at different tempos.\nDo a dramatic speed up or slow down - This will show you new aspects of your groove.\n\nUnexpected part entrance.\nIntro solo before the band enters.\n\nOnly two instrumental parts allowed. Be minimal and sparse.\nWrite a melody starting with the kick pattern.",

In my case I am set up with BMI in the US as my PRO and Publisher and have an admin pub deal with Sentric to collect in territories outside the US.\n\nAlso you'll want to be set up with SoundExchange to collect digital performance royalties (SiriusXM, iHeart, Pandora).  This often also involves the letter of direction that is kicked off with your producer agreement.\n\nI'm probably forgetting something but I'd highly recommend talking with a music lawyer to get things set up and working for you.",

Get a knobby analog synth that\u2019s easy to make sounds quickly. You\u2019ll have more fun if you\u2019re used to more tactile instruments.\n\nHaving a digital synth with a bunch of menus that\u2019s \u201cmore powerful\u201d (3+ oscillators, several LFO\u2019s, tons of polyphony) isn\u2019t any fun when you can\u2019t change the sounds quickly,easily, or intuitively. \n\nKorg MS20 was the first synth I fell in love with. Felt like playing guitar or something. Like an actual instrument.\n\nProphet 6 and OB-6 are incredible. If I had to pick one for myself it would be the OB-6. But the prophet is super versatile and usable in any style more so than the OB6.\n\nI\u2019d take an analog mono synth with knob per function over a powerful digital synth with menus",

In fact I think I'm in the best season of my life so far and it feels like everything is going right (aside: aren't you more likely to self sabotage when things are good than when they are bad?) to zoom out a little bit, i already know the answer. I'm doing too much at once, spreading myself thin beyond enjoyment. in the grit of a transition and it's clear where I'm going but I have no frame of reference for the timeline. A few years ago, I was mid-20s, in a band on a major, had roommates & cheap rent, and a chess app addiction. i was still a \"professional\" but things were extremely simple. in short, left the band, spent a few years mixing much more than producing, and now am swinging back that way. I'm about to turn 30, I have a mortgage, a (semi) dependent, my first real studio, an intern to set an example for, 5ish mixing clients at any moment, producing for 3 artists and co-prod/consulting on 2 other projects, playing occasionally in any of 4 different bands, and producing/recording some live performances (as well as starting a YT channel in this lane). In my experience at least, it really seems like something shifted at the top of this year, and I hate to say it but part of the fault is TikTok (is the rest of the fault mine?). Everything is urgent to everyone and nothing informs each other or oscillates together. It feels like a clock is constantly going \"tick, tock, tick, tock\" and the anxiety I once had over money is shifted completely towards my time management. Every time I look away from my phone I have 30 new texts. I think I'm crushing it in my professional demands but I don't know that I'm being the person I want to be for my friends, family and partner. I don't know that I'm setting a good example to this intern. I don't know that I'm there to take care of myself all the way.",

I wondered if the vets had developed any simple guiding principle about this particular relationship when finding a good balance . The guitar as an instrument is presenting me with a lot of questions about masking and level relative to the vocal , it sits so close/ across many of  the vocal Hz . How do ya ll approach this interplay . Are you scooping  700 - 2 kHz for example to make space for the vocal ? Etc etc . And this is for rhythm guitars only . \n\nI started as a guitar player in a band so I totally see the guitarists view on music , but I left guitar bands in my teens and am only returning to this music now as a mixer moving into new genres from club /rnb / hip hop background . Recurring dilemma : Drums bass and guitar no vocal , the mixes bang . Put the vocal in . Guitar and vocals aren\u2019t speaking together . Drums bass and vocal no guitar , mixes are banging .",

I know Cian already crushed a LFTWR tutorial in here I should revisit that discusses parallel saturation n such. We tracked today, got 441s on kick and snare top, sm7b\u2019s on snare bottom and hat, LCR overheads with my 251 in center and some flat pencils L/R, M201 on each tom, some random Omni EV mic on crotch and a stereo ribbon in the room (r88 clone). Room is rather dead but it\u2019s 600 sq feet so we still get some life out of it when rocking. Refs are like anything Steve Albini has touched, as well as that latest Bully record. I\u2019m mostly working on soft pop Americana type stuff so this is a very fun new adventure. So far really digging slamming the left right overheads with saturn2 transformer, may sample replace kick and snare but just with samples we took at the end. Any tips on making that shit slap in a crunchy modern way would be appreciated \u2764\ufe0f",

I got rid of MB compression on my mixbus and do earlier . So , I love the character of the SSL comp as a finisher , glue etc . Only problem . I find it impossible sometimes to avoid vocal pumping . Are there any old vet strategies for this ? I\u2019ve tried pinning the vocal on its bus pre 2 bus in an effort to anchor it in the mix , but the dynamics I lose in the vocal by so doing still don\u2019t really seem to earn me much improvement against the pumping of the SSL",

My thoughts are I want those kicks hitting spot on together , but then I\u2019m corrupting the phase relationship of the bleed in the kick out to the rest of the kit . So are y\u2019all then chasing this phase shifting around the kit multitracks and trying to build a drum mix that represents the sounds as though they all arrived at the close mics at the same instant \u2026..or are these discrepancies of the sound travelling different distances to the close mics \u2026\u2026to be preserved ? I\u2019ve experimented and will continue to do so , but I wonder if there\u2019s a consensus principle around this time / distance to phase aspect of recording and mixing drums ?",

So you'll lose $1k on average, but in actual real life it's a binary outcome: either -$10k or -$0. Insurance mitigates that variance, but not for free. So you don't just pay $1000, it gets marked up, and  you might pay the insurance company $1200 to insure against that $10,000 risk. The numbers are very very simplified to make the point briefly.",

I really like \"marimba 2\" in pro tools for some reason. really easy to hear always, feels REALLY on time.\n\n2. Maybe try having a timed delay on one of your drum signals you can play off of. like a 1/16 note or triplet echo very faintly that, when you're in the pocket, grooves with your drumming. might be tough if you're doing really busy proggy stuff or if you're really worried about timing from an OCD perspective.\n\n3. if you have scratch guitar/bass tracks that were tracked to a click/perfectly gridded drum thing, playing along to that is usually far more inspiring and you can rely less on the click because you can just listen to the instruments.\n\n4. This is where having someone else record you helps. you might be totally in your head about this. a \"producer\" could be like \"bro that take was legit perfect\"",
