    "content": "For the second question, the \"car test\" is a staple mostly because both sonically and psychologically, the car is a great counterbalance to the context and precision of the studio. \n\nThe car is also the place most people used to listen to the most music as a fan. It still is for many, but I say \"used to\" because a lot of people's #1 music listening environment outside of a studio is the phone/ headphones/ AirPods. \n\nSo my \"car test\" is now AirPod max headphones walking around my neighborhood in LA or taking the tube in London. \n\nBut the car also has its advantages because it's noisy and imperfect and NOT isolated like the studio and headphones. You can't listen as precisely in a car, which often tells you very quickly whether you can hear the important parts of your song (can you hear the vocal? Does the low end feel good?).",

    "content": "Hi Rae, these are awesome headphones but -- like any closed back headphone -- it's going to be hard to get a real sense of how things are going translate in the real world..  especially when it comes to low end. Everything on headphones is going to sound clear and direct, when that may not be the case coming through speakers. Checking stuff on some decent monitors in a decent room -- or even in your car --  is always the best way to know if things sound off or not. If you're stuck with headphones, something open back like a Sennheiser 600 will give you a less-hyped, more honest picture of your mix. They're also much less fatiguing to work on for long periods of time! But even to this day with my nice setup, I'm always checking the low end in different places... In my car, I'll know within 10 seconds of listening if things are where they're supposed to be or not.",

As for labelling, I've been using my own spreadsheet system that I find more useful than patchbay labelling software. Here's an example of my setup from last year:",

In this case, while I'd focus my attention on getting some reps in on various mixing projects, there's certainly room to grow in your equipment stable. Headphones are a great starting point and will likely continue to be useful down the road, but mixing on speakers helps you make things translate better to the real world (car & home stereos, public spaces, etc). So a pair of decent entry level monitors would be my next purchase. It will also prove useful for collaborating with other folks down the road as you can all hear the same thing from the same source.",

    "content": "Just one opinion - I've spent quite a bit of time on the Sennheiser 58X (similar to the 650s) and recently moved to the Airpods Max. That family of Sennheisers are on the better end of wired / open-back headphones for sure, but I never got to the point of trusting them fully for mix translation. I experimented a bit with adding an Oratory EQ (using RME Room EQ on my interface) and that improved them quite a bit - much less of a mental adjustment when switching back to my Genelecs. The Airpods Max to me sound similar to the EQ-corrected Sennheisers, but with a more extended low end. Also the noise cancellation is great (love switching it on while mixing FOH!) I've started mixes on them and had very few translation surprises when switching back to monitors, albeit I still don't trust them enough to finish a mix yet.  For the price I think it's actually a great deal for what you get, considering Audezes are at least 2-3x the cost and  still need EQ to sound their best imho.",

I do not find the M50s or the 770s even close to \"well balanced\", they both are a bit too budget for that distinction(they both have extreme presence peaks at their respective frequencies). I know someone who is very happy with the Shure SRH940s and Shure 1840s for critical listening(same drivers, I think). The M50s and 770s are both pretty much unusable in the low end under 50-60hz for me, I don't feel they translate well there. A few mastering engineers use the Blue closed-back headphones as a low-end reference, they would probably be worth a try. Audeze stuff is pretty good for transient response, but more expensive.",

I\u2019m having a hard time finding a prescriptive answer for this.",

Turning down the M channel on elements that I want to have be more background surrounding elements with a plugin like CenterOne is actually one of my most common mix moves and it sounds great.\n\nA good friend of mine who has made one of my favorite mixes of all time constantly talks about his use of M/S processing. I don\u2019t do much M/S other than levels and stereo imagining, but my boi does regularly and he sounds great. \n\nAll that to say: River,  It\u2019s worth being careful and listening to what could be getting fucked up in your midside processing, I wouldn\u2019t be M/S EQing personally, and you should generally only do M/S moves with speakers and generally not with headphones, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you should shy away from M/S all together if it sounds really good to you. Lots of great engineers are using it all the time.",

They do some really wild stereo stuff with the drums in the intro and the chorus - You can hear it really pronounced on headphones. It's actually a little disconcerting hearing the cymbals basically mirroring each other in the left and right like that - and the snare, too. The cymbals also have a very pronounced \"BWEEESHHH...\" sound. It's a very unique sound... I suspect there were a lot of room mics going on in that sound, but of course I have no idea.

    "content": "Hey guys! Heard a lot about this community. Sorry for the ChatGPT post but English is not my native language. Tried searching a lot about this by looking at \"headphone rec\" and \"hrtf\" but I'm getting even more confused, just craving a stable monitoring system for me. Hope this is not too newbie of a question.\n\nI\u2019m an intermediate mix engineer \u2014 normally mix on Yamaha HS8s but I\u2019ve been travelling a lot lately, and I\u2019m craving a stable monitoring solution I can rely on while on the road. I actually love how the ATH-M50x sound, but they\u2019re not giving me the translation I need for mixing. I tried Beyer DT-990 and disliked the sound. Thinking about getting Sennheiser HD650 \u2014 should I pair it with a headphone amp even though I already have an Apollo Twin? HD650 + amp might be pricey, or would AirPods Max 2 be a reasonable travel/monitoring/critical mixing alternative? Clients send notes that confuse me with the M50x (rare on the HS8s) \u2014 it\u2019s only ~10% of the time but I want that gone. Any recommendations?",

That mics' not too bad, but like so many others, it seemed to capture too much of my \"pfffbts snffff\" mouth and nasal noises - I think my deviated septum exacerbates some of these, unfortunately. lol",

    "content": "So, I've tested this a lot. The wording might sound weird: If I have the click track \"too loud\" in my headphones, I end up adapting with my drumming and my drumming kind of sucks a little bit - I end up compensating with my hits subconsciously because Im' kind of letting the click track \"hit\" for me. If that makes any sense. The way I can get around this is by having the click so that I can barely hear it. Only thing is, my drumming can be a little... less tight this way, and some measure of beat detective might have to be invoked at some point, if you get what I'm saying...",
