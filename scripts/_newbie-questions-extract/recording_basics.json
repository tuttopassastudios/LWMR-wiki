    "content": "Agreed -- be critical of everything. Be critical of things that are expensive for the sake of being expensive. Things that are just  instagram ads shilling to newbies. Critical of  Greg Wells pandering to whatever his base is. But recommending a 4k converter based on 'audible conversion quality' isn't helpful if the consumer doesn't have a million other ducks in a row first -- room treatment, adequate monitoring, proper gainstaging, etc. Jon has that figured out, so it makes sense for him. But when people come into a forum with questionable knowledge and background in music production asking what's the best converter, I think it's fair to ask some prying questions before just making blanket recommendations on what one person heard or not. I have plenty of semi-OK stuff that still gets used on the regular, and plenty of expensive gear that I would happily toss out of my workflow. They're all just tools. And whether its bougie DW Fearn or a black-friday Acustica plugin, , if it works for your workflow and gets you results you're happy with, then its worth whatever money you're willing to pay for it.",

If you're sending to a mastering engineer it's a whole different conversation.\n\nAlways think about what you're trying to accomplish at any given stage. Then go after that goal. \n\nI used to spend too much time on sonics in writing sessions. I should have been solely focused on finding emotional magic. Now  I am just trying to inspire the artists and writers around me, I'll deal with the sonics later. Much better results.\n\nI also used to fully mix-as-I-go, which painted me into a corner with gain staging and eq. Now when I get to the end of the process, I often pull things back and rebuild my levels so there's headroom and I can make that exciting production translate.\n\nDifferent approaches for different parts of the process.",

    "content": "It's a big topic, but gain staging is about finding the optimal amount of gain at every stage of the recording and mixing process.\n\nGood gain staging allows you to get the best fidelity out of a recording by preventing things from creating unwanted distortion or amplifying unwanted noise. **OR** if you are *seeking* some distortion and compression it's about turning up the gain enough to give you the amount that you're seeking from your tools.\n\nGain staging is something to be considered at all steps of the production process. For example:\n\n*1. How loud is an amplifier turned up in the room? Is the microphone being blow out by it?\n\n2. How high is the gain on a microphone preamp and is it at risk of clipping if the performer plays loudly?\n\n3. Is the gain so low that when I turn a signal up later on the noise floor will rise with it?\n\n4. If I'm recording to tape, am I recording quiet enough that it won't saturate the signal, or do I want for the signal to slam the tape and be saturated?\n\n5. How loud is an individual channel in a DAW? Is it making the channel clip?\n\n6. How loud is a signal that's being sent into a piece of hardware or a plugin? Am I distorting the circuitry at all?\n\n7. Is my signal coming in so hot that it makes a compressor react way too hard?\n\n8. How loud is the entire track I'm mixing? Is the limiter crushing the dynamics in an unwanted way? Or am I hitting it just with just enough level to get a certain flavor of pumping and clipping?\n\n9. Is my final mix going to hit digital zero and create unwanted clipping?*\n\nSo gain staging is not a single thing, but a series of choices that are made every step of the way around how you manage the \"voltage\" of your signals. Together these choices all add up to a mix that \"breathes\" well and is free of excessive or unwanted distortion.",

    "content": "My take, after listening, was that a ME should have no problem working on the non limited mix. I heard the clipping but it wasn\u2019t ugly. There are lots of things that go into making a record, and a little clipping here and there isn\u2019t gonna be the difference in a song hitting or not. \n\nBut also- allowing yourself to be curious without being fearful... Taking someone\u2019s note and asking, without judgment, if there\u2019s something you might\u2019ve missed, is worthwhile.\n\nDeeper still, and I\u2019m still working this out: taking the blame and taking the credit are the same thing, I think. Admitting you were wrong can be a sort of superpower, and all the sting and shame disappear and all you\u2019re left with is the learning and growing and relationship building. Walls go down on all sides and it becomes a team effort again. \n\nIt\u2019s real easy to let ego ruin a good feeling. Being able to say \u201cshit what did I miss?\u201d is wayyyy easier than saying \u201cbut I already said it was good so i can\u2019t go back on it\u2026\u201d it takes longer to get there sometimes, but in the end it\u2019s the path of least resistance. \n\nBBQ Sauce.",

Most likely Eric\u2019s Sonor birch kick drum with a Remo Black Dot on it. Almost certainly Vistalite toms\u2026 and this sounds like a Bell Brass snare.\n\n3) Room mics are placed probably 20 feet away, spaced wide, pointed at the kit. Eric would always point the room mics away from the drums with the cardioid null towards the drum kit, but I found I got more direct, punchy sounds with it facing the drums. Chamber mics would\u2019ve been a foot apart, pointed 45 degs out\u2026 sort of intentionally phasey to make them wider.\n\n4) Yeah, you\u2019re onto it. The overheads are intentionally wide and close to the cymbals. The mono mic and close mics are doing the heavy lifting with the drums and the L/R OHs are almost just cymbal spot mics with some kit stereo information peppered in.\n\n5) Saturation is a combination of driving the UTA pres, clipping the line input of the console, and trimming things back with the faders. Might\u2019ve been an LA-2a on the snare with no compression, just crapping out the tubes.\n\nSorry wish I woulda taken pictures of this session.

    "content": "Any basic digital multimeter that you can get at Harbor Freight, Home Depot etc will do the trick! If you generate tones (sin waves) in your DAW or with an external device you can measure AC voltages at the various points you are interested in, and calibrate if need be. It\u2019s important to understand what various decibel levels translate to in voltage, as that is what you would be measuring. For example, +4dBu = 1.228 Volts, and -10dBV = 0.316 Volts. But like the other answer said, unless you need to calibrate your outputs for a specific reason, you will be fine connecting various pieces of pro-audio gear as long as you pay attention to the gain staging and adjust gain as necessary so there\u2019s no clipping. And if you need to interface with a consumer level device you\u2019d probably be better off getting a bump-box or something of the like.",

That said There are people that sum 4 mics down to 1 signal on a mixer and it sounds amazing.  \n\n2. The more performances  you add of the same part, the more blurry it will sound.if you need different textures, consider recording a DI so it can be blended in with your amp in any manner of your choice, either reamping, distorting with a plugin, whatever.

You hear \u201cthe left and right being different is what makes something wide\u201d\nThis is true. But I loathe when it\u2019s so different it feels lopsided.\n\nHow do we address this? \n\n-double track using the same guitar so the tuning and intonation is most similar \n\n-change the amp head but keep the same cabinet/speaker so the overall EQ is similar but my the gain structure is different\n\nIf you use 2 different guitars, consider the scale lengths. This will change subtle intonation things, for better or worse.",

All the vocals I\u2019m getting for every song is recorded without an outboard mic pre or compressor from a C414 to an audient ID4\u2019s mic input . Prob is even when the tracks are not clipping in levels but they all sound like there\u2019s some small level of clipping going to the AD converters .  And I doubt the vocalists has decent microphone techniques singing in. Seeing that the vocals are supposed to sound kinda warm n not as polished , Even with some EQ moves, the vocals are still sounding like there\u2019s some 3rd harmonic sounding saturation on them.  Anyone experienced this before ? Would love to hear anything that\u2019ll help it sound better . \ud83d\ude05",

This has evolved over many years and has taken many forms, but it\u2019s really just a good starting point for me and speeds up my workflow quite a bit. I\u2019ve got three main busses that feed into a master drum buss. \u2018DRUM SUB\u2019 is my uncompressed (or lightly compressed) buss. \u2018DRUM PAR\u2019 is my heavily compressed buss, and \u2018DRUM DIST\u2019 is my parallel distortion buss. I don\u2019t necessarily always use these, but having them ready to go makes it easier to quickly audition different ideas. Sometimes I\u2019ll duplicate one or two of them to get another flavor involved. Again, everything to taste. \n\nAlso in the template are some very basic aux\u2019s I find myself using often. There are two parallel SansAmp busses. I have two because often times if I use one on the kick drum, it rarely works for the snare drum, so I have a second one ready to go. There\u2019s also a \u2018SNARE SLAP\u2019 and \u2018SNARE GATE VERB\u2019 that rarely get used but if I need to inject a little mojo, they\u2019re a good starting point.\n\nThe \u2018D SUB TRIM\u2019 is just a master fader controlling everything going into the bussing, so if I get a little overzealous with level, I can manage the gain staging quickly without having volume automation grouped. These three (sometimes more) busses then feed into the final \u2018DRUM MSTR\u2019 , where I\u2019ll do final overall EQ tweaks and level adjustments.",

If you can take the lid off try an aea r88 diagonally across the body one side pointing to the high strings one side pointing towards the low and mids, this has been one of the most natural sounds I\u2019ve EVER gotten from a piano. It just feels so real and right. You can also try some other great stereo mics like the sm69 on cardioid for both caps. Used to stick that in a similar position as the 88 with the lid on the big stick and then blanket the whole thing to fuck. You could get amazing separation even with drums in the room and it still sounded natural. There\u2019s also the humble 57!!!

    "content": "This is a very broad question with many different answers, but I think the easiest way to sum up the concept of \u2018gain staging\u2019 is simply figuring out what level every \u2018device\u2019 is expecting and/or which level is ideal to get the results you want. These \u2018devices\u2019 can be a plugin, a piece of hardware, an A/D/A converter, an auxiliary bus, a mix bus, etc.\n\nIn analog world\u2026 there might be fathomable difference when a compressor or amplifier receives -10dBVU vs +10 dBVU. Accounting for these differences would be considered gain staging \u2014 and you\u2019d be looking for what gets the ideal sound out of your box.\n\nIn digital world\u2026 some plugins may react similarly and others may not care if you\u2019re sending -6dBFS or -0.01dBFS. It\u2019s usually case by case as there are myriad plugins. You also need to consider what level the plugin is sending signal out \u2014 as this will affect how the next plugin processes the audio, or how much headroom it has to work with. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m sending signal out of a compressor plugin into an EQ plugin \u2014 and lets say I\u2019m using the compressor to beef up mean volume of the signal and then I want to EQ some more low end into the signal after the fact. Well, I\u2019m going to be adding gain in the compressor and then the level going into the EQ will be hotter than originally intended. Id want to trim down the output of the compressor (or the input of the EQ) so you have headroom to be able to boost those frequencies without clipping the output of the EQ. In a 32-bit floating mixer like Pro Tools, these issues become less audible as the mixer has higher headroom than its indicating, but you never actually know \u2014 and it\u2019s best to just stick to the parameters that you have control over. If you were to do this same function with an analog compressor and EQ, there would be very noticeable distortion if you didn\u2019t stage the gain properly.",

    "content": "Sometimes gain staging is just managing the signals going to an auxiliary bus or a master fader. If you\u2019ve got everything summing into - say - an aux bus in pro tools, and that aux bus is clipping, then that will be audible distortion going into the next gain stage. It may sound good, it probably doesn\u2019t \u2014 so its something to account for earlier down the chain. If you\u2019re going into a master fader in pro tools, and your signal is over 0dBFS, you can simply turn down the master fader, and it is actually turning down all the signals going to it, not just the output. This is useful because you can then throttle the input to your first plugin in the chain \u2014 say a limiter or maximizer. It\u2019d be a shame to have a fancy clipper on your master bus, only to be clipping the signal in the chain before even getting to it.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a scattershot answer to a scattershot question, but the reality is that everything affects everything in audio. And having your head wrapped around signals levels going in and out of things will help you make faster decisions and help you troubleshoot quickly when things aren\u2019t sounding quite right.",

While I really liked the sound of the mix as is,  I also have reason to trust my ears the least (inexperience). The clipping data made me realize that there could be something I'm missing by going with this one. If I wind up hating the change I'll just go back to using the initial one despite the clipping data. That way I at least see what the alternative winds up being. This ME did mention that he was willing to work on the mix as is, but how he framed it leads me to believe it might not be a good fit if I go with that version.  I definitely Trust Noah's ear though, and his messages give me the reassurance to walk if need be. If I need to walk, I also now know who to hit up to use that initial version.",

I have a question about recording guitars: I have a bunch of songs that fluctuate a lot dynamically. Live, I use three or four clean boosts to drive my amp into different levels of distortion (jcm 800). The last time I did a record, I just did it as though i was playing live - just hitting the boosts along with the click when the song went into the different sections. It worked fine, but I've had many working engineers tell me that's NOT the way to do it. Rather, I should have recorded each section that has a different level of distortion/ intensity on its own, so that way I can have more control over the mix and end up with cleaner transitions, potentially... I'm just curious how people here may have handled such a thing. Not that it's important, probably, but I'll add that I don't use any volume or tone controls on my guitars - just humbucker straight to jack. I control all the dynamics with my pedals and strumming hand. Thanks.",

    "content": "Hey, gang. Little bit of a dilemma here: I'm recording bass for my album. On song seven, and I looked at my little clip-on delta lab tuner and noticed that the number was at 439 and not 440. I have no idea if I've been recording to 439 this whole time or if I just bumped the little down arrow while I was clipping it on just now or what, but - Is there an easy, free-ish way I can see what I've recorded my bass at?",

Sometimes I spend a full day juggling the lyrics of multiple songs, or producing many concepts, or mixing, or recording vocals for multiple tracks. \n\nThe upfront work for making this was a lot, but now that it\u2019s made it\u2019s more like \u2018okay done with recording\u2019 then open this to move it over for reference when I sit down the next day in case I forget what stage a given song is at.\n\nIt was definitely convoluted to setup, but I agree and appreciate yalls sentiment that not having it bog me down is #1, cus it serves no purpose if it adds friction or distraction to the song making progress.\n\nI will move forward focusing on the end result and only use this as an invisible tool to help me meet my deadline - Thank you everyone!",

    "content": "To illustrate a good example of the difference and why (guessing) Jon would want to clip rather than do this (which would control the transients as you describe)\n\nIf you use a long look ahead, call it a limiter with a long look ahead. That will let the processor know about the transient well before it hits the GR circuit, thus avoiding distortion/harmonics (of course there still could be some artifacts). But even though there will be samples at the threshold, it won\u2019t be a straight line waveform as if you clipped it. It is pushing the waveform down. The waveform itself is actually changed still, so it is not exact but it\u2019s different than clipping.\n\nA clipper just squares it off. Hence harmonics.\n\nThis is why you can limit/compress an instrument like piano, which has a tendency to hear distortion easily, when clipping it would be a disaster (unless you are going for that)",
