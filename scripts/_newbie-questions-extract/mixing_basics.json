    "content": "A tangent\u2026\n\nI\u2019m lucky to have spent many years in a great studio with lots of great drums & gear\u2026 not to mention being mentored by one of the great engineers of our time. Having this perspective is massively useful in mixing other peoples tracks, because I feel I have a north star of what good drums can sound like if they\u2019re recorded and performed properly. It used to be that my starting point for mixing drums were working with tracks that I had recorded myself\u2026 and most of the above problems were solved before the mix stage. These days, with smaller budgets and time constraints, its very rare that this is a possibility.\n\nI\u2019m including this drum tracking session from a few years ago that I recorded at Barefoot. It was for a project that Matt was producing that never saw the light of day. But we went all out with the drum setup in the big room, through the console, and had a great drummer. This might be useful for some people who have never gotten properly recorded drum tracks\u2026 to get a sense of how good thigns can sound before the \u2018mix\u2019 stage. These are the tracks that were printed into Pro Tools off of the console, and the three busses were prints of the outboard compressor busses we were using while monitoring. It\u2019s unlikely these busses would get used in mixing, but they\u2019re a good reference to what we were listening to in the room while we were tracking. But as you\u2019ll notice, the individual drum blend can stand on it\u2019s own two feet. Hopefully this is useful as well.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

On very rare occasions if I knew there was going to be a huge dynamic shift I\u2019d reach out and grab the output fader, but I can probably count on one hand how many times I\u2019ve had to do that.\n\nWe were fairly conservative on the 1176 on the way in, largely cause you can\u2019t un crunch a vocal that\u2019s been over compressed, but once the vocal was in PT it would be hit by just irresponsible levels of compression and limiting. Like goes against how virtually every \u201cexpert\u201d online would tell you how to do it. Most people would tell you the solo\u2019d tracks would sound bad, but as part of the song their impact is objectively unarguable",

    "content": ".\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively)\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

    "content": "It's a big topic, but gain staging is about finding the optimal amount of gain at every stage of the recording and mixing process.\n\nGood gain staging allows you to get the best fidelity out of a recording by preventing things from creating unwanted distortion or amplifying unwanted noise. **OR** if you are *seeking* some distortion and compression it's about turning up the gain enough to give you the amount that you're seeking from your tools.\n\nGain staging is something to be considered at all steps of the production process. For example:\n\n*1. How loud is an amplifier turned up in the room? Is the microphone being blow out by it?\n\n2. How high is the gain on a microphone preamp and is it at risk of clipping if the performer plays loudly?\n\n3. Is the gain so low that when I turn a signal up later on the noise floor will rise with it?\n\n4. If I'm recording to tape, am I recording quiet enough that it won't saturate the signal, or do I want for the signal to slam the tape and be saturated?\n\n5. How loud is an individual channel in a DAW? Is it making the channel clip?\n\n6. How loud is a signal that's being sent into a piece of hardware or a plugin? Am I distorting the circuitry at all?\n\n7. Is my signal coming in so hot that it makes a compressor react way too hard?\n\n8. How loud is the entire track I'm mixing? Is the limiter crushing the dynamics in an unwanted way? Or am I hitting it just with just enough level to get a certain flavor of pumping and clipping?\n\n9. Is my final mix going to hit digital zero and create unwanted clipping?*\n\nSo gain staging is not a single thing, but a series of choices that are made every step of the way around how you manage the \"voltage\" of your signals. Together these choices all add up to a mix that \"breathes\" well and is free of excessive or unwanted distortion.",

It's not bad, but it's not as fun to use as the other options, and I think that has an effect on your results.\n\nBoth the FabFilter Mastering bundle and Soundtoys bundle are great and you wouldn't go wrong with either pick. But they occupy different niches: FabFilter is clean and surgical while Soundtoys is all about injecting vibe and coloration and doesn't include anything remotely surgical.\n\nI guess if you can only pick one I'd start with Soundtoys for the vibe and the way it would expand the sonic palette for your production work. Your DAW is going to have some perfectly capable EQ's and compressors to tide you over until you're ready for FabFilter.\n\nPut another way, your production work is upstream of your mixing work and will influence the sound of your records more.",

If you mic that amp with a single mic, that mono signal has the reverb as a part of it. When you pan that complete signal, it carries a kind of depth and character that is very different from a stereo reverb or even a separate send. \n\nMono elements with their own reverb can achieve an interesting spatial clarity that you can't get with eq or compression or whatever else you use to give elements their own place in a mix.

Efficient method goes like this:\n\nPT Downmixer stock plugin is the one for this (it collapses stereo channels to mono) - flip the phase of one side in the GUI and save that as your user default. If you insert your Downmixer on a faux stereo track, it\u2019ll immediately silence it, so you can happily split and delete what you don\u2019t need. \n\n(Check the meters though, sometimes ambience or other subtle stereo info isn\u2019t very audible unless cranked.)\n\nIf the stereo track contains slightly panned mono information, pushing/pulling either of the faders in Downmixer will quickly get it to cancel, and you can note how much extra gain you need to add or subtract when level matching in the final step (below). Obviously if it\u2019s deliberately panned info, you can either just leave the track stereo or match the pan position by ear (I prefer to do this because I like mono channels to behave like mono channels, and also half the CPU you\u2019d use on a stereo track).\n\nFinally, use clip gain to add 3dB to the resulting mono channel, and obviously pan it centre. This makes up for the level change according to default pan laws in Tools (-3dB).",

    "content": "i love this question. i've been doing this for long enough that the cycles of how records sound has changed several times. so every few years i try and take some time to unlearn/relearn.\n\nthere's no good short answer, but i'd start with taking some time outside of mixing to just listen to records. whether you've done this before or not, get to know your speakers and your monitoring environment better than before. listen to your favorite records that you know well, and make some tweaks. you don't necessarily have to redo your whole setup, but listen to your speakers in slightly different positions, different settings on the back of the speaker, etc. and really dig into listening and enjoy yourself.\n\nthat's usually enough to make me think about mixes very differently (which ultimately means i get better when i re-incorporate most of the things i already know). but if you need more, just try and simplify. start a mixing by just leveling everything. clip gain and leveling and panning. then balance frequencies and compress (via compressor or saturator or limiter or whatever). basically, with fresh ears, go back to basics.\n\nnot sure if that will transform you into a new mixer, but that's an outline of an approach i use when i feel like i need a big talent upgrade",

Many compressors have have automatic volume compensation included and others will require you to adjust the makeup gain that comes after the compression.\n\nThe reason it's important is because when we're comparing the dry signal to the compressed signal, the louder of the two signals will always feel better to us. It's important to match the volume levels when comparing so that we're not fooling ourself into thinking a louder signal is better and we can hear the compression (or most effects) for what really is.",

Almost certainly Vistalite toms\u2026 and this sounds like a Bell Brass snare.\n\n3) Room mics are placed probably 20 feet away, spaced wide, pointed at the kit. Eric would always point the room mics away from the drums with the cardioid null towards the drum kit, but I found I got more direct, punchy sounds with it facing the drums. Chamber mics would\u2019ve been a foot apart, pointed 45 degs out\u2026 sort of intentionally phasey to make them wider.\n\n4) Yeah, you\u2019re onto it. The overheads are intentionally wide and close to the cymbals. The mono mic and close mics are doing the heavy lifting with the drums and the L/R OHs are almost just cymbal spot mics with some kit stereo information peppered in.\n\n5) Saturation is a combination of driving the UTA pres, clipping the line input of the console, and trimming things back with the faders.

Once you like how it\u2019s grabbing, adjust the release time to taste, back down that ratio and threshold and you\u2019re off to the races.

Its great that you're double checking your moves later and trying to be objective about if its an improvement or not. Also- SOMETIMES its a boost not a cut thats needed.

Often something like 90ms on one side, 120ms on the other. Feel it out on one side, then add some time to the other.\n\nTry adding some fake distance to your existing room mics with a simple delay with no feedback (there\u2019s a Steve Albini drum video on YouTube where he demonstrates this). You can delay both sides equally, or solo one side, delay it til it feels good/sounds cool, then do the other. Anything from 12ms-around 23 seems to work. From there things start to become more like a slap, but than can be cool too.\n\nSmash up your existing rooms a bit, or a lot. Omnipressor, Devil Loc, UAD Zener, decapitator, Rough Rider (free), Arousor/Distressor in nuke, Lo-Fi. \n\nSend to a gated verb - Cian shared a drum session a while back with a short VintageVerb preset that\u2019s often useful. RMX16 Non-Lins can be good too, although it\u2019s easy to bring things into 80s territory this way.\n\nSend to a short room verb like ocean way, SP2016, Pro-R, Valhalla Room, Raum. Sometimes from close mics, sometimes from overheads, sometimes just slapping it straight on room mics. A little distortion (Decapitator, Devil Loc) after is often helpful.\n\nWith all of these solutions, the thing that seems to help them gel with the rest of the real kit is drum bus processing - compression and/or saturation.",

Usually starting with bass, guitars, keys and finally vocals. Some people do vocals first \u2014 that\u2019s never worked for me. Once you have a balance of the track, you can start really incorporating some of the overheads and room mics to give the drums more dimension and flavor.

Sometimes, if the engineer did their job, the multi-mic recording will be really complete and will need the tom mics for the overall sound\u2026 so no gating at all. Again, all depends on what you\u2019re working with.\n\nOnce I move on with the rest of my mix, I\u2019ll find myself doing EQ moves on the drum buss and treating it more like one instrument to get other things happening in the mix\u2026 only doing small tweaks to the individual sounds.\n\nI hope this all makes sense?",

    "content": "Neat question. If you're mixing in two channels (L/R) the headroom should be the same no matter where you pan it (with some caveats which we'll get to). If you have a kick drum panned dead center coming in at -6dB on your digital meter it's going to be coming in at -6 in both the L channel and -6 in the R channel. Each channel has it's own independent headroom that doesn't affect the other (until we add a limiter with linked channels), so let's simplify things a bit and mute the R channel for now:\n\nNow you have your L channel with the kick panned \"center\" and the R channel is muted.  If you were to pan this kick to the hard left it would not affect the volume of the L channel at all. That's because the panning effect is created by subtracting gain from the R channel only. Making the kick sound like it's leaning to the left.\n\nNow there's one big element I've left out so far, and that's *pan law*. Ableton Live has a -3dB pan law. This means that sounds panned to the center are reduced by 3dB. Because if a sound is being played at the same volume by both the L and R channels then their voltage will combine to create a sound that is louder than intended. So all DAWs and mixers compensate for this added loudness by turning down the gain of sounds as they are panned closer to the center (and shared between both speakers).\n\nSince all modern DAWs and mixers have pan laws implemented, what happens when you now pan the kick hard left is that it ends up becoming 3dB louder than it was when it was panned in the center, because it is no longer being turned down by the pan law when it\u2019s centered.",

Instead, he carefully clip gains each transient/syllable/word/phrase into his dynamic processing (e.g., compressor, saturation, limiter), giving him precise control over how hard he hits the limiter.\nI suppose another method to achieve similar results and that level of control would be to clip gain without processing, and then initiate a limiter (or your choice of dynamic processor) and automate the threshold and output to achieve the desired performance, but that seems like way more work to me.\nI think Jon's method works well and I've been using it myself for a while.

You need a high ratio to get the deeper ducking effect that it seems you're seeking.\n\nUsing a soft ratio will never get you a big duck unless you have the threshold pulled all of the way down.

That family of Sennheisers are on the better end of wired / open-back headphones for sure, but I never got to the point of trusting them fully for mix translation. I experimented a bit with adding an Oratory EQ (using RME Room EQ on my interface) and that improved them quite a bit - much less of a mental adjustment when switching back to my Genelecs. The Airpods Max to me sound similar to the EQ-corrected Sennheisers, but with a more extended low end. Also the noise cancellation is great (love switching it on while mixing FOH!) I've started mixes on them and had very few translation surprises when switching back to monitors, albeit I still don't trust them enough to finish a mix yet.  For the price I think it's actually a great deal for what you get, considering Audezes are at least 2-3x the cost and  still need EQ to sound their best imho.",

So he does more subtle moves to bring out the best in each mix. If you're recording stuff yourself, you will likely want to add a lot of compression to get the same modern, perceived loudness.\n\nThe fundamental thing to know is that \"compression\" simply means \"reducing the dynamic range\" (aka \"compressing\" the range of volume of your sound ). This can be achieved with \"compressors\" as well as \"limiters,\" \"saturators,\" \"clippers,\" \"distortion,\" and a number of other types of effects that do it in different ways (and may add other sonic characteristics to your sound).",

Now just grabbing a mic to record takes a little longer, but I can do a lot more fun & creative work on the way in. \n\nSo even if you decided to go 500 series, I\u2019d argue that the modularity isn\u2019t as big of a selling point on a microcosmic level. \n\nIt might be worth thinking about the 500 series like a console, get yourself 8 Avedia Ma5s and do all your eq & compression in the box.",

Subtle saturation, I find an instance of Saturn works wonders on some kicks and a lot of other drum sources. 4. Gating and compression, can work wonders to clean up a kick or snare, always checking to make sure that any processing is actually an improvement. 5. Additive eq, boost those pleasing freqs! I should note that 95% of this whole process happens while listening to everything, I don\u2019t usually solo any one element to do any of this (except to start the gating maybe)",

I don't know what the living freak I did wrong, but I didn't notice how horrifying it was until I was deep, deep into this album. After I'm done tracking, I'm gonna go in there and dissect the situation - I don't know if it's the head or just that I tuned in the perfectly horrible spot or if it's the drum itself or the mic placement or what, but as long as I basically turn the EQ of the 7b (that's what it was recorded with) into a beta 52, and then do a sharp dip at 790, it's passable... I absolutely HATE to EQ like this, preferring to be snobby and do it all with the mics, but sometimes, I guess, you gotta do what you gotta do... Will mess around with re-tracking/ putting new heads on and shit after I'm done with these initial takes... I could ramble on... Midwest represent!",

My personal goal, is to get the sound to be as awesome and huge and perfect with 1 pair of guitar tracks doubled, with 1 mic on an amp. That\u2019s the ideal scenario for me. That said There are people that sum 4 mics down to 1 signal on a mixer and it sounds amazing.  \n\n2. The more performances  you add of the same part, the more blurry it will sound.if you need different textures, consider recording a DI so it can be blended in with your amp in any manner of your choice, either reamping, distorting with a plugin, whatever. (Check phase)\n\n3. I like when the left and right are *subtly* different, no drastically different. You hear \u201cthe left and right being different is what makes something wide\u201d\nThis is true. But I loathe when it\u2019s so different it feels lopsided.\n\nHow do we address this? \n\n-double track using the same guitar so the tuning and intonation is most similar \n\n-change the amp head but keep the same cabinet/speaker so the overall EQ is similar but my the gain structure is different\n\nIf you use 2 different guitars, consider the scale lengths. This will change subtle intonation things, for better or worse.",

Sometimes  i have my hands on the compressor input and output and I\u2019m attenuating both. I like a 176 compressor for this as it\u2019s  very forgiving in gain reduction. If I can\u2019t manage any of the above I mult the vocal and have one safety track with the gain trimmed to a safe spot",

I have found, however, that if I don't have the snare exactly the same distance from the overheads, that I can distinctly hear the snare pulling to one side or the other - no matter how much I high pass - and this bothers me.

This has evolved over many years and has taken many forms, but it\u2019s really just a good starting point for me and speeds up my workflow quite a bit. I\u2019ve got three main busses that feed into a master drum buss. \u2018DRUM SUB\u2019 is my uncompressed (or lightly compressed) buss. \u2018DRUM PAR\u2019 is my heavily compressed buss, and \u2018DRUM DIST\u2019 is my parallel distortion buss. I don\u2019t necessarily always use these, but having them ready to go makes it easier to quickly audition different ideas. Sometimes I\u2019ll duplicate one or two of them to get another flavor involved. Again, everything to taste. \n\nAlso in the template are some very basic aux\u2019s I find myself using often. There are two parallel SansAmp busses. I have two because often times if I use one on the kick drum, it rarely works for the snare drum, so I have a second one ready to go. There\u2019s also a \u2018SNARE SLAP\u2019 and \u2018SNARE GATE VERB\u2019 that rarely get used but if I need to inject a little mojo, they\u2019re a good starting point.\n\nThe \u2018D SUB TRIM\u2019 is just a master fader controlling everything going into the bussing, so if I get a little overzealous with level, I can manage the gain staging quickly without having volume automation grouped. These three (sometimes more) busses then feed into the final \u2018DRUM MSTR\u2019 , where I\u2019ll do final overall EQ tweaks and level adjustments.",

I'll peel back the ratio once I have everything triggering properly to let some bleed in to taste. Sometimes I'll only gate 2-3 dB to just get something to pop. Sometimes its in a vaccum.\nI will very rarely compress individual drum mics. And I pray that the recording engineer didn\u2019t either. I like most of my compression to come from the busses. It sounds more natural to my ear and allows you to get away with a more compressed, exciting sound than just whacking the close mics. I\u2019ll find at the beginning my drum mixes will be very \u2018pokey\u2019 \u2014 I want each drum to sound explosive and over the top. That way when i start compressing them, they maintain their transient quality when they start getting dynamically reduced.\n\nI\u2019m always cutting tons of 250-350 out of the kick drums and trying to manufacture any attack with saturation instead of EQ. Having a SansAmp or a Saturn plugin adding high end always sounds more natural to me than just additive EQ. I\u2019m always very wary of the 2-5khz region, and find even-order harmonics are the best bet to fill in the blanks there.\n\nI tend to like my snare drums warm, so often low-shelving down the super low end and keeping the 150-300 \u2018boosh\u2019 intact. I try to avoid using HPF on drum mics because at this point, things should be relatively in phase, so if I put a filter on, it\u2019s going to throw the whole kaboodle off whack. Shelves are your friend here. And same as with the kick drums re: adding high end \u2014 I\u2019m wary off adding the snap in the 2-5khz range, I\u2019ll try and have the body of the snare drum really singing so I only have to add a little bit of top end, often above 5khz just for some air.",

    "content": "Hey all, got a question about sidechaining in Ableton, specifically kicks and bass/808s. I normally just use a generic compressor when sidechaining with a soft ratio, no attack/short release, and pretty low threshold (-18 to -24) and it usually works pretty well. Sometimes however the compressor alone isn't enough to dip the 808 and allow the kick to punch through cleanly. I was going to try using F6 instead, but I can't figure out how to sidechain the kick signal itself into F6 (in Ableton at least). Any tips?",

With the stock Ableton plugins this happens automatically when you engage the sidechain but for 3rd party you have to add it manually.  I don't have F6 but looking up an image of the plugin it looks like the option is in the bottom right (2nd picture).\n\nIf that doesn't work then I'm not sure what's going wrong.",

Aliasing is caused by non linear processes like distortion, and dynamics processing (compressor or limiter). Lots online about what it is and why it happens but you can sum it up by saying it\u2019s an inharmonic, digital sounding hash that can feel bright but in a kind of ugly way (but remember sometimes ugly is good)\n- **Higher sample rates reduce the impact of Anti Imaging and Anti Aliasing filters in AD to DA converters.** Filtering is necessary for accurate capture and replay of analog signals, and it in the early days of digital it used to be a real challenge. Now it\u2019s basically a solved problem, but if you are doing acoustic music, with delicate transient information there is still a small but real advantage to higher rates\n- **Higher sample rates reduce overshoot and inter sample peaks on limiters.** This really only matters if you are sending your loud mixes directly to release, otherwise your mastering girl or guy should handle that",

    "content": "This is a very broad question with many different answers, but I think the easiest way to sum up the concept of \u2018gain staging\u2019 is simply figuring out what level every \u2018device\u2019 is expecting and/or which level is ideal to get the results you want. These \u2018devices\u2019 can be a plugin, a piece of hardware, an A/D/A converter, an auxiliary bus, a mix bus, etc.\n\nIn analog world\u2026 there might be fathomable difference when a compressor or amplifier receives -10dBVU vs +10 dBVU. Accounting for these differences would be considered gain staging \u2014 and you\u2019d be looking for what gets the ideal sound out of your box.\n\nIn digital world\u2026 some plugins may react similarly and others may not care if you\u2019re sending -6dBFS or -0.01dBFS. It\u2019s usually case by case as there are myriad plugins. You also need to consider what level the plugin is sending signal out \u2014 as this will affect how the next plugin processes the audio, or how much headroom it has to work with. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m sending signal out of a compressor plugin into an EQ plugin \u2014 and lets say I\u2019m using the compressor to beef up mean volume of the signal and then I want to EQ some more low end into the signal after the fact. Well, I\u2019m going to be adding gain in the compressor and then the level going into the EQ will be hotter than originally intended. Id want to trim down the output of the compressor (or the input of the EQ) so you have headroom to be able to boost those frequencies without clipping the output of the EQ. In a 32-bit floating mixer like Pro Tools, these issues become less audible as the mixer has higher headroom than its indicating, but you never actually know \u2014 and it\u2019s best to just stick to the parameters that you have control over. If you were to do this same function with an analog compressor and EQ, there would be very noticeable distortion if you didn\u2019t stage the gain properly.",

Gainstaging sets the record up to show off its best qualities\u2014and are those qualities in the low end of a booming bass synth and the natural silky quality of the vocalist, or maybe you want the mid range to feel really detailed yet cohesive and warm. \n\nUnderstanding this, for me, made the finishing process that Jon talks about make sense. Level setting inherently overlaps with the kind of decision making process of EQing, which is something you can probably understand best from this clip of Bainz talking about how he can get a vocal to be so upfront in his mixes because he\u2019s surgical in what he keeps in there. The way I understood it, he\u2019s cleaned up the vocal a ton, set the levels of his tracks by what feels important to bring to the forefront for the listener, and then he uses those levels to inform his EQ moves throughout.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CkSeHgrosyx/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=",

I was curious to the best way to route my current setup for recording and mixing.   VLC PRE > compressor>RME UCX II > Lynx Hilo > PMC speakers. I have RME connected to the PC through USB then the hardware loop (pre+comp) running in and out of the hilo then using spidf coax to connect to and from the RME. Monitor outs of hilo are running to the PMC 6-2s  and lastly using AES to monitor the stereo out of mix . My small brain still can't get things to work properly this way. I'm assuming its user error somewhere in the software routing? Any input would be extremely appreciated. Thank you for your time<3",

Turning down the M channel on elements that I want to have be more background surrounding elements with a plugin like CenterOne is actually one of my most common mix moves and it sounds great.\n\nA good friend of mine who has made one of my favorite mixes of all time constantly talks about his use of M/S processing. I don\u2019t do much M/S other than levels and stereo imagining, but my boi does regularly and he sounds great. \n\nAll that to say: River,  It\u2019s worth being careful and listening to what could be getting fucked up in your midside processing, I wouldn\u2019t be M/S EQing personally, and you should generally only do M/S moves with speakers and generally not with headphones, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you should shy away from M/S all together if it sounds really good to you.

Like, I'm hearing things in the drums that I want to cut - 390hz or whatever, guitars too - and every time I pull some of it out, it sounds better, but I lose the impact, and the song doesn't move along as well as it did before. So I always end up just putting it back in... I've mainly been using Reaeq - Reapers stock parametric EQ, but I'm wondering if I need something different? Do I need to start messing with different eq slopes and shapes and whatnot??",

The only real way to hear a phase shift is to be in an anechoic chamber and play a specialized test signal (like a sine wave with timed phase shift pulses to create a slight warble)\n\nI get how on individual tracks if you EQ something, the phase shift can affect how that track interacts with another track when summed, but I often hear that for example, Jon puts a 16k boost then a 27k low pass on the master that creates a phase bump that he likes. Which theoretically shouldn't be audble... Shouldn't it be some other reason like the VT5 saturating a special way?",

With the Rough Ryder mention - Are you referring to the compressor by Audio Damage or is there another one (distortion plugin?)? Also, i was thinking about this recently: I wonder if one of the reasons I'm not super stoked with my room mic sound is because i recorded them through the spdif on the back of my interface Yeah - When i was getting started, i didn't have that many channels, so i kind of \"sacrificed\" my room mics by sending them through the spdif inputs so that i could use my pres for more important stuff. They honestly don't sound bad to me, but i was wondering if that could be a reason why i just never got them to fit well in the mix - crappy spdif or something just not gelling well. That's probably a silly thought.",

That will let the processor know about the transient well before it hits the GR circuit, thus avoiding distortion/harmonics (of course there still could be some artifacts). But even though there will be samples at the threshold, it won\u2019t be a straight line waveform as if you clipped it. It is pushing the waveform down. The waveform itself is actually changed still, so it is not exact but it\u2019s different than clipping.\n\nA clipper just squares it off. Hence harmonics.\n\nThis is why you can limit/compress an instrument like piano, which has a tendency to hear distortion easily, when clipping it would be a disaster (unless you are going for that)",
