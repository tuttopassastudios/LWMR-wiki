If you're not already familiar with nylon string guitar, you may want to lay your hands on it and make sure that it's a sound you're interested in.",

If you can play electric guitar you'll pick up a steel string easy, while a nylon guitar takes a little bit of adjustment because the fretboards are much wider and the string spacing is wide to match. It's nothing you can't get used to, but it can lead you to different playing styles on each.",

Could it yield some fun effects? Maybe?! I'm sorta with Matt... if you're already in the computer, and unless you're sending out to something with a shitton of tubes or transformers, you're probably best staying in the box. Some 'pre-amps' that I do come out of the box for distortion on a regular basis are: Ampex 351 (god bless this thing) and the Scully 280. But I'm looking for real distortion that I'm typically using in parallel, nothing subtle. I use Spectre/Saturn/Decapitator/Neutron for that stuff.",

Like @Rollmottle says, you want the live tracks to be predictable and consistent and whoever is handling the tracks should ensure that they're level-matched relative to each other. You want to do your best to ensure that the live tracks are all reaching the live engineer at a consistent and unwavering level, so that they aren't getting any curveballs from the person running the tracks.",

Nowadays, in the computer, it's less important and just comes down to workflow. Sometimes some mixes call for a more uniform reverb to tie tracks together... in this case putting it on a send makes more sense. But there's no rules anymore, and if you don't like that workflow, then fuck it. Do it your way. There's no right or wrong on this.",

As @cian riordan says, you may be getting some build-ups because the performer, the mic, or both are placed in the middle of an acoustic node that is accentuating or sucking the energy out of particular frequencies at that point in the room. Try moving performer and mic by increments of 12\"-18\"  and listen to whether or not that improves the sound or works against it.",

Regardless of whether I\u2019m mixing something I engineered/produced, or something from someone else, I usually start by muting most things and building the song back gradually. As I piece things back in I always have an ear out for resonant pokey stuff and just try to address it ASAP. That\u2019s either through using spectral shaper (very new to me but awesome) or soothe, or just notching stuff with an EQ. I personally avoid doing any of this on the mix bus\u2014if I\u2019m doing it on busses it\u2019ll be some kind of subgroup. Once things are nice and clean, you can boost a lot to get clarity/aggression/etc. etc.. I will say since you mentioned working late at night, I feel getting a decent volume out of my monitors is pretty revealing for this. I don\u2019t mix all that loud, but I definitely have a decent level going. My goal is always to be able to crank things and not have harsh stuff poking at my eardrums!",

    "content": "If I get through the kick and snare and find things starting to sound too \u2018scooped\u2019, I\u2019ll try and fill in some blanks with parallel sansamp or the distortion buss. I like the distortion buss technique because if offers a consistency across all the tracks and you dont just have a distorted snare drum but pristine clean toms. Often its a Decapitator with a low shelf going into it killing some low end. I\u2019ll solo this buss, get it to sound crunchy but not messy, then un-solo, bring the fader to neg-infinity, and blend it into taste. You\u2019d be surprised how much excitement you get without totally fucking up the aesthetic of the drums.\n\nAs for samples? Sure! I\u2019ve you\u2019ve gone all-balls on these tracks and you\u2019re still lacking what you think you need, then no shame in supplementing with samples. \u2018Supplement\u2019 being the key word here. I use the Massey DRT to extract MIDI from the kick & snare mics and then use Battery to trigger my samples. I have a few samples that just solve various problems for me. Sometimes just giving me the low end sub, or a 100 cycle knock. They can be helpful to punch your way through phasing issues and really get the meat and potatoes of the rhythm track holding its own. I will never \u2018replace\u2019 with a sample\u2026 there\u2019s always something useful in the recorded track if you try hard enough.",

I\u2019m gonna completely simplify and exaggerate. When we talk about making room in a mix, usually we usually talk about giving each sound it\u2019s own space in the mix. I understand this from a frequency point of view. But when talking about mono vs wide sounds I\u2019m kinda lost. \n\nIf let\u2019s say i have 2 sounds, one is mono and one is wide.  Would that leave one with more headroom compared to having the same 2 sounds both in mono? \n\nOr would the wide sound take up more head room, because to make a sound wide, it needs to be different on both sides. But doesn\u2019t that mean that you would have double the amount of signal as you would need two different versions of the same sound playing at once to achieve wideness? \n\nFx a mono guitar and a mono vocal both centre vs a completely anti phase guitar and mono vocal. I know the latter will make each sound more intelligible but wouldn\u2019t you at the same time provide more information resulting in less headroom?",

I use the pedal for recording my guitars through it, but also re-amping sounds from my daw through it. I want to add more pedals to the chain as well, but am not sure as to what the best way to go about this is so that I don't have to keep re-arranging cables and have everything in a convenient location. Also I do all my recording through an LA-610mk2 that goes into the Hilo which means I can only record in mono. Seems like I'm gonna need another pre-amp/more inputs to make everything communicate/function fluidly. What do you guys think?",

As a die hard EV/barefoot fan, getting to dig into these tracks is probably one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever gotten to do.\n\n@cian riordan , I\u2019ve got some questions if you\u2019re willing to answer or remember:\n\nAre these all UTA pres?\n\nDo you remember what drums you were using?\n\nHow are the room mics (U67s) placed? This, alongside the chamber mics, seriously gave me goosebumps to listen to. \n\nHow are the overheads placed? They seem super wide and right over the cymbals but when you add the snare mic it all sounds perfect. \nIs all the saturation on each channel a product of driving the UTA preamps? I\u2019m amazed at how distorted they are when solo-ed and how much it allows them to punch through.\n\n\nSorry for my gushing, but this is just the coolest thing ever to me.

The likelihood of this happening as well as other factors (like how much cash they have) would determine your upfront fee. But nowadays in HipHop it\u2019s not weird to see producers get pub as well. As beats have a much bigger influence on / or become a part of the song than with other genres. If you can negotiate it, get as much as you can. But decide for yourself what trade offs you\u2019re willing to accept and what upfront fee you\u2019re not willing to go below. To me it just sounds like they\u2019re hyping themselves up and there aren\u2019t any concrete plans on the song being released with a ML.",

It's usually a matter of building up the low end  first and bringing the mix to the brink of crapping out whatever master chain you have without completely falling apart. Then trying to shoe horn in the other elements with aggressive & drastic scooping to maintain the gain structure you've got going with the 808s. Like Jon says often, it's usually about turning things down to gain headroom, and then making it up with low end boosts or high cuts. It's so impressive when it's done right -- shoutout to J.C. -- him and Ali are the best in the game IMHO.",

Just keep going and developing your existing relationships.\n\nThat feeling of \"I don't really know what I'm doing\" is normal. It happens to most of us. And that's okay. I think you'll be surprised when you someday realize that a tremendous amount of people have no idea what they're doing; even those who seem in control. You do your best in the moment and then build on what you've learned and you do it even better the next time.\n\nDon't be afraid of failure. The most courageous thing that you can do is to put yourself in a situation where you feel vulnerable. You will fail and you will fail again, and finally you will succeed. Then you will find yourself in a situation where you get to fail at bigger, better things. That's the process of self-actualization.\n\nYou should repeatedly strive to put yourself in a position that puts you at the edge of your abilities. That very feeling of being uncomfortable is a sign that you're in the right place. Challenge yourself and go for it. Pushing yourself in this way is the path to growth and achievement.\n\nYou're doing great.",

Just keep doing, keep trying to find any avenue to push you\u2019re knowledge/experience/discography forward. Every record you make you\u2019ll learn something new AND you\u2019re already getting paid for your work (win). Spoiler alert: You\u2019ll NEVER feel like you REALLY know what you\u2019re doing. If you do, you\u2019ve lost (I know this must sound odd coming from someone who @cian riordan  thinks is so knowledgeable and brilliant) Satisfaction breeds mediocrity. Music is far too vast for anyone to fully understand    everything in their lifetime. Bake that into the equation as you try to figure out how you feel about where you\u2019re at.",

The verb may already be de-correlating the L/R channels (making them different from each other) in the optimal amount.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that different frequencies will likely have different amounts of phase rotation from the dry input signal, so flipping the polarity on one channel (left or right) might cause some frequencies to nullify and some to be accentuated. I wouldn't worry about trying to predict these relationships. It's all a mess by design. Use your ears and see what sounds good.",

    "content": "thanks! @Slow Hand & @oaklandmatt. \n\nSomething i've been noticing a lot lately is, when playing with width effects, i keep preferring, sticking to only one type of widening at a time, instead of combining. To me it achieves the \"clearest\" or most intentional result. For example, for some cool widening on guitar i could use a pingpong slap where one side is phase-flipped. It sounds huge and great, now let's say i also want to chorus it. For some reason it seems to loose some of the width or wow effect of the original widening technique. So i'll usually try a few different effect and see which one i prefer, and 9/10 it always achieves my preferred effect picking one, even tho i like the idea of combining, different techniques to sound \"unique\". The Diminishing returns seem to work against the sound i like in my earholes. I've noticed in a lot of sessions i've been given or been in, a lot of people seem to love adding a bajillion subtle widening things on their lead vocals and when ever i just choose one and turn it up, people usually ask what crazy voodoo i'm doing. \n\nThis is all in the context of widening a mono or less wide sound.",

If the frequencies (usually the low end) that are fighting phase wise are the exact same volume, it will be super obvious that htey are phasing out.",

So I have lots of memories working there tracking beautiful sounding acoustic things that were really wonderful and open. In recent years, I\u2019ve dug much more into aggressively processing sounds/making more creative engineering decisions that often involve mangling shit.

They'll be less precious about reaching out to you for feedback/additional files/etc and you'll be more candid in your feedback. Also, if you haven't worked with that person, very easy to find people who have and shoot them a quick note. \"How was your experience? Would you hire them again?\" From there you can just go down the list of pricing, availability, etc.",

Where I disagree is the work to properly align it when it gets back, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s not too vibe killing to just have them copy paste my square wave down on to the end of their track. It\u2019s one extra key command that most people can handle, and gives me (and the artist) the confidence that I\u2019ve fully respected and captured their unique flow and timing. \n\nRight before I end up moving every word and syllable and breathe anyway.",

Since I used him for the entire EP, I don't really have another baseline for price differentials. I hesitate to reach out on soundbetter sometimes because the assumption is that I wouldn't be able to afford it by default. Nonetheless, I figured asking here could be a good start for the comparison. Completely open to budgeting more and waiting until I can afford the new cost.",

After that, all negotiations were done as that new number being my base rate, and anything less was a discount (I love the idea above of marking that discount on the invoice so your full rate is still shown).

I don't see why it matters who is footing the bill. makes sense with production and points discrepancies, but mixing? huh?",

That\u2019s why they brought you in. To help them \n\n- You must be a patient and active listener who can read the norms of the room and act within those norms in a way that puts others before yourself",

    "content": "1) a strong work ethic: You have to be willing to put in the time and energy into the project. You will always be the first person there and the last to leave. Once you accept this and work it into your life, it just becomes the way it is!\n\n2) a good personality: You need to be good around people. Half of this job is psychological. You have to know when to speak up as well as when to not say anything. Talkback etiquette is crucial. Learn to read people. Never get angry or passive aggressive. You always need to be voice of reason. People have to trust you.\n\n3) a solid skill-set: You have to always know what your doing and be confident in your abilities. Know the technical side of things. You should also be musically inclined. Be curious! Why does a song sound a certain way? How did they do it? If you don't care and don't want to know \u2013 you should do something else.\n\n4) actual follow through: You'd be surprised how many flaky people work in this business. If you're a guy that does things when you say you'll do them and answers phonecalls/emails in a timely manner, then you're already leagues above most other people.\n\n5) the ability to network with people and capitalize on your relationships is the only way to move forward in this business. Going to shows, parties, events, etc. You never know where work is going to come from.\n\nYour work gets you work. Make sure everything you do is the best representation of your abilities. Don't choose which projects to care more about. Give it your all on everything... even if its a shitty gig. That word will spread and you'll start getting more work through that.\n\nHope this helpful. Good luck!",

Meetings with the majors, false promises, yada yada\u2026 I was like a sapling in a massive forest, in good company but super overwhelmed and without the tools and advice I needed to make a lot of the right decisions. A lot of my collaborators just wanted to make some good music / earn some money and never really offered any advice or wisdom. And that\u2019s fine, no shade there.\n\nBut fast forward to now where I\u2019m at working as a producer with lots of new, young, independent artists, I\u2019m doing my best to not just be a guy for hire, but a friend in the industry. I try to give my advice, share my experiences openly and honestly, and empower them as much as possible to avoid the pitfalls I found myself in like ten years ago as a hungry kid wanting to impress everyone.\n\nAll about that concept of being who you needed when you were younger, mate \ud83d\udc4c",

Anything beyond it is experimentation- which you could do, but try not to spend more than 5 minutes on each \u201cwhat if\u201ds. \n\nI found 80% theory helpful. \n\nDo your 80% not 100%. next year, your 80% is going to be your last years 125% or possibly more\n\nThere\u2019s beauty in capturing what it was at the time. That\u2019s why we call records \u201crecords\u201d. This beauty can get lost when you\u2019re trying to do more than what it is, what it wants to be.

I\u2019ve let go of the word perfect and had to put conscious effort into not using the word. \n\nI highly doubt that the bottleneck to you being able to put out a record is your ability or production technique. It\u2019s the idealism. I speak from my personal experience. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with learning, that is great.

I think something about the way that it was tuned or the drum itself is just resonating at a nasty frequency. It sounds like an underwater homing device - like a submarine or something. It's not super bad in the mix, but when the kick is going on its' own it's pretty audible. To me, at least... Aside from sample replacement, would Soothe 2 be the thing to try in this case?",

When you fatten up unison- you can get that packing bump of resonance with the filter. That\u2019s kind of the sound of Prophet 6 thing\n\nOB6 also sound great, my friend has it- but I don\u2019t really have much experience with them. I like how the unison sounds on it, and OB6 uses SVF (state variable filter) and it\u2019s gives this thin, but thick texture. Both prophet 6 and ob 6 have very distinctive/recognizable sound. \n\n(funny coming from a guy who has NO hardware synth- but I\u2019ve messed with a few of them! + I was a HUGE synth nerd)",

    "content": "When I was doing my deep dive recently - there's a couple great videos put together by Starsky Carr and J3P0 with comparisons.  I think Prophet 5 wins out on raw tone from the oscillators, but the 6 is 90% of that flavor with a much more modern filter.  They added vintage mode a couple years back which really helped it step even closer to the Prophet 5/10, and the modern features like the Arp, Sequencer, and on board effects as well as that very sick analog distortion circuit make it a lot more versatile for sound design (within the Prophet tonescape obviously).\n\nI'm still in the honeymoon phase with mine but I'm glad I went with a P6 personally.  A lot more viable as a performance instrument and it can also get very very very close to the P5/P10 sounds if you keep it dry and keep the filter closed a bit more.\n\nThe only thing the P6 doesn't do that the P5/P10 can that I wish it could is the way it does voice allocation in non-unison modes - I believe it always steps through round-robin with voices, whereas the P5/P10 retriggers the same voice for the same key until you move away from that key.  Not a huge deal since you can use Unison 1 voice for basses if you want to retrigger the same voice each time.",

(Had pretty spot on emulations of some of the more identifiable synth sounds of the last few decades, so in the heat of battle it\u2019s super easy to pull up a Depeche Mode dupe (or a Radiohead or phil Collins or whatever). Plus the take 5 just has that big ass filter knob, which for most of not super synth nerds is where the magic is, really easy to sweep. For pure sonics and sonic exploration and inspiration though, trigon hard to beat. (As it should be for more than 2x the price)",

I'll add processing I think is appropriate for the song, while trying not to overdo it, and then I'll automate the clip gain into that to make things a bit more \"ideal\" when it makes sense.  \n\noften will do this as part of my editing phase. once that's locked in I shift over to mixing mode. might process more  for might leave things as is just ride the some faders /sends . depends on what the song is asking for tbh.\n\nif I'm producing or tracking I usually try to get as close to \"the sound\"  as possible during that phase  regardless of the gear I have available. even when I get sent vocals I'll ask for both wet and dry but 95% of the time I'm working from the wet ones.",

They were in fact so passionate about music that even when the artist thing started to fizzle they found a way to stay involved\u2026 that kind of love and dedication to a craft usually leads to a certain level of talent. Cian\u2019s not just a fader jockey, he\u2019s also a great drummer. Matt Rad was in punk bands. Noah has played for 10\u2019s of thousands of people at a time.

    "content": "@BoozleBAM it's worth adding that it's fun to realize that the drum set is just that: a set of drums. The idea that one person plays all the drums in one coordinated set all at once is a pretty narrow part of the whole of drumming, percussion, rhythm, etc. \n\nThere are SO many cool and interesting ways to make \"drums\" happens.\n\nI would spend some time with some of these records that people are sharing, and thinking about ALL the rhythmic components, both separately and together. \n\nTake some time, be patient, and try to expand your brain in how you think about this stuff. Lots of good insight from people here and some amazing trails for you to follow. I'm excited for you!",

Once it got to be too much, I started looking for an entertainment lawyer. Ended up with a guy who used to manage Travis Truit or something and he offered to write my ex-producer a letter for free. Really nice and helpful guy - for the little guys. So, yeah. Thank goodness I'm self-produced now and don't need anything from anybody, but the next time I do get involved with anyone in a production capacity or mixing or whatever and I feel like I'm deserving of a certain something, I intend to call Sam up and get things squared away before I start. Also, I'll add that the toll it took on my health - struggling with that producer basically in isolation, wasting time, feeling powerless, etc. etc. - was not negligible. That situation actually made me physically ill, and none of us artist types deserve that. So - take care of yourself.",

Much less experienced than everyone on here, but the one metric I keep coming back to is: Do I respond to it emotionally - The track that is... If the performance is flawless and the mix is hitting all the specs on the nerd meter, but i'm not responding to it emotionally, then, I mean... I dunno. Currently trying to reconcile this emotional response that I consider so paramount with the fact that things aren't quite where I want them to be sonically. Sometimes, I think you just have to find the right plugins that will enable you to move closer to what you want sonically without fucking with the flow. Kind of a catch 22 at times. Regarding the plugin thing being good on the stock setting: I read somewhere a while back that most plugin makers put the stock setting as stock because that's where they thought the plugin sounded best. I sometimes feel like if I use a stock setting that I'm cheating as a mixer, but am I even a mixer?? Lol. I'm just a musician fiddling with knobs.",

My thoughts are I want those kicks hitting spot on together , but then I\u2019m corrupting the phase relationship of the bleed in the kick out to the rest of the kit . So are y\u2019all then chasing this phase shifting around the kit multitracks and trying to build a drum mix that represents the sounds as though they all arrived at the close mics at the same instant \u2026..or are these discrepancies of the sound travelling different distances to the close mics \u2026\u2026to be preserved ? I\u2019ve experimented and will continue to do so , but I wonder if there\u2019s a consensus principle around this time / distance to phase aspect of recording and mixing drums ?",

    "content": "The way I typically use the fabricat is in parallel as it has a wet/dry mix, and also going more on the large side for slices/grains of audio. So for me it kinda is like how you would use delay pedal, but the repeats have a mind of their own. Often I\u2019m going for a balance of responsiveness and surprise! And if I want it to be more on the ambient side I turn more wet and more repeats",

I first thought it was the car I was in, but then I switched vehicles and it's happening in that car, too. It's only that one station, but yeah - all the music that comes through sounds like it's put through some type of flanging effect and is also much lower volume-wise. It's only that one station. Been that way for about a week now. I vaguely remember something like this happening a while back. Anyway, just wanted to see if anyone here has experienced anything similar in their area. Thanks.",

So you'll lose $1k on average, but in actual real life it's a binary outcome: either -$10k or -$0. Insurance mitigates that variance, but not for free. So you don't just pay $1000, it gets marked up, and  you might pay the insurance company $1200 to insure against that $10,000 risk. The numbers are very very simplified to make the point briefly.",

One real and simple example is this band repeatedly requested \"guitar up\" \"vocals down\" over and over again and the guy is pretty new to guitar so it was pretty shambolic, which I was trying to hide a little.  The balance was getting ridiculous, to my ears at least, but I just went with it.  \"It's their record, not mine!\"  But then there's part of me that feels responsible for them like I can't let them shoot themselves in the foot.  I thought maybe they're listening in a car and it sounds weird.  Or a phone speaker.  Just some paranoia.  I think I'm struggling a little like \"when do I step in and try to say something and when do I not?\"  This was their first EP of their young lives FYI.   I imagine the more pro bands are not asking you to make crazy revisions.    (and to be clear - the revision notes are mostly great and make the song better)",

Also, if I had the guitar I was tracking along to too loud up the center, I would end up compensating or adjusting a bit too much with the subsequent take and I would end up with a quieter take on one side. I had to have the take I was tracking along to really quiet (like minus 28db, even -25 was too loud) in order to get a compelling subsequent take. Barely hearing it was helpful, but I also think it accounted for some of my off-ness in intonation in parts.",

Then I'd pull up my snare mic. and it sounded...the same.  I found that if the snare sounds the same in the OH's and rooms as it does in the close mic, it ends up sounding smaller bc of phase or lack of variety.\n\nif you're using 16 drum channels and 8 of them sound the same, what's the point?\n\nThe OH's and rooms for me with that many microphones, i am trying to get width or energy. so the differences between the left and right is what makes it sound big and immersive, and let's the snare mics be their own thing dead center. \n\nNow, if I am doing a 1-5 mic setup, I will concern myself more with all of that stuff and try to get the snare to sound really great and centered.",
