You can send someone spiraling with doubt based off of one comment, perhaps your own limited understanding of the material. \n\nEven the way you phrase something can make all the difference. \"Hey AJ, I hear what you're going for and I love it, but I think there's room for the bass to hit harder if you can back off the levels. Just trying to to get you the vibe that I think you're going for. And if you hate it, no worries and we'll go back to your louder track.\"",

Now  I am just trying to inspire the artists and writers around me, I'll deal with the sonics later.

Of course I have no idea about what you are doing currently...but zero people I've ever talked to in this situation have taken enough shots. \"I reached out to 5 people this week\"...no. HUNDREDS. Most people will ignore you. But just keep going. Watch a Goggins video before you start or something haha\n\nReally think about the experience of working with you. Is it amazing? Is it easy? Is your communication, care, intention incredible? Even things like how files are named/delivered/etc matters. You can only be as good as you are at mixing until you get more reps. But you can control how you interact and the professionalism and confidence you can inspire on the other side.\n\nIf someone lets you mix a song...are they coming back? They need to if you are going to have a business doing this!\n\nSorry to be prescriptive here...but I've seen this question asked of me enough to know that it's so so hugely about just brutal persistence in many aspects, assuming you have talent, etc to do the actual thing.",

It\u2019s more \u201coh the chorus is louder, let\u2019s knock it back a click or two on the input so it doesn\u2019t distort\u201d\n\nWe were usually recording songs in fairly small sections, making sure to get the details right. There wasn\u2019t a lot of jedi like fader riding. On very rare occasions if I knew there was going to be a huge dynamic shift I\u2019d reach out and grab the output fader, but I can probably count on one hand how many times I\u2019ve had to do that.\n\nWe were fairly conservative on the 1176 on the way in, largely cause you can\u2019t un crunch a vocal that\u2019s been over compressed, but once the vocal was in PT it would be hit by just irresponsible levels of compression and limiting. Like goes against how virtually every \u201cexpert\u201d online would tell you how to do it.

    "content": ".\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively)\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

    "content": "It's a big topic, but gain staging is about finding the optimal amount of gain at every stage of the recording and mixing process.\n\nGood gain staging allows you to get the best fidelity out of a recording by preventing things from creating unwanted distortion or amplifying unwanted noise. **OR** if you are *seeking* some distortion and compression it's about turning up the gain enough to give you the amount that you're seeking from your tools.\n\nGain staging is something to be considered at all steps of the production process. For example:\n\n*1. How loud is an amplifier turned up in the room? Is the microphone being blow out by it?\n\n2. How high is the gain on a microphone preamp and is it at risk of clipping if the performer plays loudly?\n\n3. Is the gain so low that when I turn a signal up later on the noise floor will rise with it?\n\n4. If I'm recording to tape, am I recording quiet enough that it won't saturate the signal, or do I want for the signal to slam the tape and be saturated?\n\n5. How loud is an individual channel in a DAW? Is it making the channel clip?\n\n6. How loud is a signal that's being sent into a piece of hardware or a plugin? Am I distorting the circuitry at all?\n\n7. Is my signal coming in so hot that it makes a compressor react way too hard?\n\n8. How loud is the entire track I'm mixing? Is the limiter crushing the dynamics in an unwanted way? Or am I hitting it just with just enough level to get a certain flavor of pumping and clipping?\n\n9. Is my final mix going to hit digital zero and create unwanted clipping?*\n\nSo gain staging is not a single thing, but a series of choices that are made every step of the way around how you manage the \"voltage\" of your signals. Together these choices all add up to a mix that \"breathes\" well and is free of excessive or unwanted distortion.",

It's not bad, but it's not as fun to use as the other options, and I think that has an effect on your results.\n\nBoth the FabFilter Mastering bundle and Soundtoys bundle are great and you wouldn't go wrong with either pick. But they occupy different niches: FabFilter is clean and surgical while Soundtoys is all about injecting vibe and coloration and doesn't include anything remotely surgical.\n\nI guess if you can only pick one I'd start with Soundtoys for the vibe and the way it would expand the sonic palette for your production work. Your DAW is going to have some perfectly capable EQ's and compressors to tide you over until you're ready for FabFilter.\n\nPut another way, your production work is upstream of your mixing work and will influence the sound of your records more.",

    "content": "I have a couple distinct phases of my workflow. The \u201ctechnical\u201d phase let\u2019s call it, is all about letting my brain objectively search for the very specific kinds of things that are distracting within the mix at hand. This is much more of a thinking and corrective process than it is a feeling one, even though feeling and taste is 100% involved. This part of the process is to get the mix on a more solid foundation if needed.\n\nThe next phase is where I want to actively NOT be thinking at all. This is why I do the first part separately. I want to be FEELING the music in this phase and not be taken out of it by the vocal resonance at 1.8k at 1:35 in the bridge. I want to turn that part of my brain off so I can focus on the music, the feeling, the lyrics, the intent, the song and try to find where (or if) I can elevate or reveal or better frame the heart of what\u2019s there. This is meant to be the flow state, moving intuitively and viscerally based on what\u2019s coming out of the speakers. This is where efficiency in toolset matters -- where an extremely efficient human-computer interaction matters, where knowing your tools cold matters. I want to reduce latency between feeling and move and I don\u2019t want anything to get in my way. \n\nSo to answer your question: I think about ways to continue to be able to access and preserve that crucial flow state during the time where it matters the most. And it can manifest a million ways that aren\u2019t directly related to mastering at all: taking a walk, working out, doing a J, listening to a new record, checking Discord, unplugging, whatever. And yes, sometimes it also means refining my template or my Streamdeck shortcuts or creating a new preset.",

I find i can get way more out of my master bus limiter that way while keeping the dynamics.\n\nAlso standardclip is cool if u automate up the gain and down the clip on a vocal that is dynamic if you want it to distort tastefully in parts.

Even on the same project, from the same mixer, it can vary widely. Mixers differ in how they deliver as well.\n\nMy opinon is mixers should take the song as far as they can, get it as close to finished as possible, this is better for the music to me. Don't even think about mastering. Then any great ME can add more x/y/z as they hear it (not always level, mastering is also about restraint). \n\nIf you can be concerned with making the music the most itself and singular as possible, really listening for the song, you are doing the right thing. Maybe it needs to be loud, maybe not. Often it seems to me there is a misplaced focus on continuity, or a comparison to a reference, which leads me to ask...are we listening for the music anymore? Or some target that is not what we've actually made?\n\nJust listen for what's there, and do absolutely everything you know how to do to help that. Any competent ME can take it from there, however you prefer to deliver",

    "content": "Neat question. If you're mixing in two channels (L/R) the headroom should be the same no matter where you pan it (with some caveats which we'll get to). If you have a kick drum panned dead center coming in at -6dB on your digital meter it's going to be coming in at -6 in both the L channel and -6 in the R channel. Each channel has it's own independent headroom that doesn't affect the other (until we add a limiter with linked channels), so let's simplify things a bit and mute the R channel for now:\n\nNow you have your L channel with the kick panned \"center\" and the R channel is muted.  If you were to pan this kick to the hard left it would not affect the volume of the L channel at all. That's because the panning effect is created by subtracting gain from the R channel only. Making the kick sound like it's leaning to the left.\n\nNow there's one big element I've left out so far, and that's *pan law*. Ableton Live has a -3dB pan law. This means that sounds panned to the center are reduced by 3dB. Because if a sound is being played at the same volume by both the L and R channels then their voltage will combine to create a sound that is louder than intended. So all DAWs and mixers compensate for this added loudness by turning down the gain of sounds as they are panned closer to the center (and shared between both speakers).\n\nSince all modern DAWs and mixers have pan laws implemented, what happens when you now pan the kick hard left is that it ends up becoming 3dB louder than it was when it was panned in the center, because it is no longer being turned down by the pan law when it\u2019s centered.",

Instead, he carefully clip gains each transient/syllable/word/phrase into his dynamic processing (e.g., compressor, saturation, limiter), giving him precise control over how hard he hits the limiter.\nI suppose another method to achieve similar results and that level of control would be to clip gain without processing, and then initiate a limiter (or your choice of dynamic processor) and automate the threshold and output to achieve the desired performance, but that seems like way more work to me.\nI think Jon's method works well and I've been using it myself for a while.

The world isn't fair, mostly no one who would hire you actually cares about how you are feeling or what's happening in your life. Or even some sense of loyalty for what we have done before. Do we bring value? And how can we bring more? That's all that matters really. And it is brutal and hard. It still very much is for me too.

So he does more subtle moves to bring out the best in each mix. If you're recording stuff yourself, you will likely want to add a lot of compression to get the same modern, perceived loudness.\n\nThe fundamental thing to know is that \"compression\" simply means \"reducing the dynamic range\" (aka \"compressing\" the range of volume of your sound ). This can be achieved with \"compressors\" as well as \"limiters,\" \"saturators,\" \"clippers,\" \"distortion,\" and a number of other types of effects that do it in different ways (and may add other sonic characteristics to your sound).",

So before I instantiate and add any gain from inflators or limiters at the end of my master fader chain, I have 2-3db of headroom. \nStarting with kik snare bass around -6db, adding in vocals and everything else all balanced properly usually gets me to around -2. Which is more than enough for a mastering engineer but not enough to get myself into trouble tryna get to make it loud with my Ozone or whatever. \n\nThat\u2019s just my process currently. No doubt there\u2019s different ways to get there, some likely much better, but this has been working well for my purposes.",

In order for someone to give it a go with you, it would take some level of trust that they won\u2019t be getting back a fucked up mix. \n\nI\u2019m a producer that occasionally mix for others, and I found it the easiest to get in on earning people\u2019s trust by offering other things first. Record them, or tune vocals for them and then let them know you also mix. People are more likely to record with someone they don\u2019t know yet than to have someone they don\u2019t know mix or produce their stuff.\n\nAs a producer, I\u2019d deny free offers from new mixer to mix what I\u2019m working on unless I have heard their work and I like them. I\u2019ve had people ask if I need mixing and offered through their relationship with the artists- it always came back fucked\u2026 at least so far. So try to get in with producers through offering other stuff like engineering in writing sessions. Comp and tune the demo vocals you got from the writing session, if you do a great job they\u2019ll more likely to give it a go with you. Don\u2019t ask too early, make sure you build a good rapport with them first. Vocal tuning can fuck things up just as bad as mixing, so try to find things where you can just do it (e.g. you just recorded vocals for someone) over asking people if they need their vocals tuned.",

My additional complicating factor is having a laptop that is a dupe of the studio rig, so keeping it all straight and everything in sync is a bit of a puzzle. \n\nI took the transition as the opportunity to phase out some mechanical drives so I had to get some new drives for the M4 instead of re-using the old Time Machine mechanical drive. The M4 mini only has Thunderbolt/USB C ports -- the M1 has USB A's and Thunderbolt/USB C's so I needed a TB hub to get my old USB hub to play on the M4. The move forced me to sort out my iLok strategy between my mastering rig and my production rig because it was quite messy (I ended up getting a 2nd iLok for the M4 to make things way easier between it and the laptop). It was just a lot of little stuff for me. If you're not changing machine form factors and it's mostly a software exercise, then it might be worth it.",

The transients(which for me are absolutely crucial to hear when producing or mixing) are almost inaudible on the M50s, while decently audible on the 770s. I do not find the M50s or the 770s even close to \"well balanced\", they both are a bit too budget for that distinction(they both have extreme presence peaks at their respective frequencies). I know someone who is very happy with the Shure SRH940s and Shure 1840s for critical listening(same drivers, I think). The M50s and 770s are both pretty much unusable in the low end under 50-60hz for me, I don't feel they translate well there. A few mastering engineers use the Blue closed-back headphones as a low-end reference, they would probably be worth a try. Audeze stuff is pretty good for transient response, but more expensive.",

If the mix is such that you're taking off a lot of transients on the master buss, it may sound better to ease off the limiter or bypass it entirely so that the live sound engineer will have plenty of headroom to work with and isn't trying to mix around a track that's massively limited. Having that extra headroom and transient energy could be a benefit, thought you'll have to use your ears to make that judgement, and definitely talk to the artist.",

    "content": "I would tell them there's a few things to consider when pressing vinyl:\n1) Mastering is especially important as it\u2019s the real bridge between the music and the mechanical production of the record. I had the great pleasure of mastering a few records for vinyl with Doug Sax (give him a google) and there\u2019s a lot more to the process than modern mastering for digital services. They will actually cut the acetate disc which will be what manufacturers use to make the metal stamper that actually molds the records. A lot of thought goes into this process such as the width of the grooves to accommodate bass frequencies, etc. If you want a good sounding record, there\u2019s no way around working with a seasoned professional.\n\n2) Side lengths are important, as is track order. The more music you put on a side of vinyl, the less fidelity it will have as a whole. There will be sacrifices in the manufacturing to accommodate all of the music, so it\u2019s best to keep your side lengths under 20 mins. Closer to 15 mins per side is ideal sonically, but sometimes that means doing double records and that just gets expensive. Also the order in which the tracks play on each side plays a part. The songs at the beginning of the side have more bandwidth and less distortion\u2026 it basically diminishes the closer you get to the center. Whatever the last track on the side is will just sound worse. It\u2019s a flaw in the medium\u2026 so think about that.",

I\u2019m already somewhat aware of the answers I may get, but who knows. Sorry if this is long, I\u2019m bad at short form.\n\nContext: I have been producing music in sincerity for maybe 3 years now, been a hobby since like 16. I\u2019ve started to engineer out of necessity for my individual artistry, but one thing led to the next and I gained a fair bit of skill at it (or so I\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m still pretty insecure, honestly even being around all the really knowledge people on here makes my panic disorder go \ud83d\udcc8). I\u2019ve gotten an internship at a studio as a runner and a session assistant down here (it\u2019s not paid but it\u2019s not exactly unpaid), and I truly have learned a lot (I learn something new on the daily I swear), but I\u2019ve yet to have any true guidance from an established figure yet (which very well may never happen), which I know isn\u2019t necessary, but it absolutely makes me question my own abilities/career decisions despite what happens with my freelance work and I\u2019m curious to know if this is like normal/how other people cope. \n\nLike, I\u2019ve gotten a somewhat okay share of people who pay for my work as an engineer/producer/writer, but the \u201cdo you really know what you\u2019re doing\u201d doubt doesn\u2019t fade easily\u2014even when I\u2019ve been paid by people on like label level budgets, I\u2019m never really registering that success. I\u2019ve had cool moments and landed spotify placements as a mixer for artists, and there\u2019s this part of me that\u2019s still somewhat ashamed that I do a lot more work for free than I care to admit. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the comments on the old episodes that has me spooked (Jon on #61 re: \u201cnot everyone can be a mixer\u201d), but is this like just me or do even some of the really wicked smart people here still feel that\u2014and if so, how do you guys handle the it?",

Aliasing is caused by non linear processes like distortion, and dynamics processing (compressor or limiter). Lots online about what it is and why it happens but you can sum it up by saying it\u2019s an inharmonic, digital sounding hash that can feel bright but in a kind of ugly way (but remember sometimes ugly is good)\n- **Higher sample rates reduce the impact of Anti Imaging and Anti Aliasing filters in AD to DA converters.** Filtering is necessary for accurate capture and replay of analog signals, and it in the early days of digital it used to be a real challenge. Now it\u2019s basically a solved problem, but if you are doing acoustic music, with delicate transient information there is still a small but real advantage to higher rates\n- **Higher sample rates reduce overshoot and inter sample peaks on limiters.** This really only matters if you are sending your loud mixes directly to release, otherwise your mastering girl or guy should handle that",

    "content": "Sometimes gain staging is just managing the signals going to an auxiliary bus or a master fader. If you\u2019ve got everything summing into - say - an aux bus in pro tools, and that aux bus is clipping, then that will be audible distortion going into the next gain stage. It may sound good, it probably doesn\u2019t \u2014 so its something to account for earlier down the chain. If you\u2019re going into a master fader in pro tools, and your signal is over 0dBFS, you can simply turn down the master fader, and it is actually turning down all the signals going to it, not just the output. This is useful because you can then throttle the input to your first plugin in the chain \u2014 say a limiter or maximizer. It\u2019d be a shame to have a fancy clipper on your master bus, only to be clipping the signal in the chain before even getting to it.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a scattershot answer to a scattershot question, but the reality is that everything affects everything in audio. And having your head wrapped around signals levels going in and out of things will help you make faster decisions and help you troubleshoot quickly when things aren\u2019t sounding quite right.",

I'd love to hear, on a very basic level, how you all approach using the plugin and if there are any starting points that you would recommend. Also curious how this might change in different use cases (i.e. mastering, mix bus, drum bus). Are you simply sliding down the \"clip\" fader until you reduce the peaks a little and then making up gain with another plugin? Are you touching the other 3 faders at all? Do you find yourself frequently auditioning and changing modes and oversampling amounts or sticking to consistent setting. Thanks!",

    "content": "To illustrate a good example of the difference and why (guessing) Jon would want to clip rather than do this (which would control the transients as you describe)\n\nIf you use a long look ahead, call it a limiter with a long look ahead. That will let the processor know about the transient well before it hits the GR circuit, thus avoiding distortion/harmonics (of course there still could be some artifacts). But even though there will be samples at the threshold, it won\u2019t be a straight line waveform as if you clipped it. It is pushing the waveform down. The waveform itself is actually changed still, so it is not exact but it\u2019s different than clipping.\n\nA clipper just squares it off. Hence harmonics.\n\nThis is why you can limit/compress an instrument like piano, which has a tendency to hear distortion easily, when clipping it would be a disaster (unless you are going for that)",
