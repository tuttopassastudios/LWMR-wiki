    "question": "So I just sent masters to a label - digital and vinyl. \n\nHow involved have you been in test presses and selecting which one gets pressed? Has the band ever had opinions? Are you trying to find the one that is most faithful to the original files sent?",

        "content": "The point of the test pressing isn't to pick one, it's more of a sanity check on the vinyl master.  I would always recommend an acetate to avoid the pain in the ass of discovering a problem with your master at test pressing. The acetate precedes the sign off on the master and allows you to hear what your music MIGHT sound like on a record. It is definitely lesser quality than a test pressing and a full vinyl run, but the $80 or $100 it costs will be money well spent to avoid a wasted cycle and cost of a bunk test-pressing.",

My previous audio engineer cost 300 per song for a mix + master. How far off is that from the typical range? Since I used him for the entire EP, I don't really have another baseline for price differentials. I hesitate to reach out on soundbetter sometimes because the assumption is that I wouldn't be able to afford it by default. Nonetheless, I figured asking here could be a good start for the comparison. Completely open to budgeting more and waiting until I can afford the new cost.",

At the studio I was at, I was really 95% of the time tracking, mostly live ensembles, and a good amount of jazz. We had big soffit mounted ATCs. Amazing mics, beautiful room. So I have lots of memories working there tracking beautiful sounding acoustic things that were really wonderful and open. In recent years, I\u2019ve dug much more into aggressively processing sounds/making more creative engineering decisions that often involve mangling shit. So in my current world, I\u2019m interested in higher rates to push off that aliasing issue, but day to day am perfectly happy at 48.",

    "question": "Oh yeah, for sure. It\u2019s easy to overdo it, and satisfying enough that sometimes you don\u2019t know in the moment.\n\nUltimately you can be 100% in the right speaker or 100% in the left speaker, and pushing beyond that is tempting the gods. As far as I can conceive it, any process that attempts to widen a signal that\u2019s already entirely decorrelated must have the potential to reintroduce some correlation. Thinking again of the ping pong delay, is there really anything wider than that?\n\nI was doing a lot of M/S mix buss widening stuff a few years ago, and I realized that it could do some pretty weird shit to panned vocals and the like. While it feels like you can just \u2018turn up the sides\u2019, you\u2019re really doing something unnatural to the center, too, and the relationship between channels. Like you\u2019re choosing select bits of a sound to turn up, but only the bits of that sound that don\u2019t have anything in common with the other speaker. This is a lot of rambling just to say that there\u2019s clearly a point of diminishing returns, and maybe the solution is to pan something else less wide to create contrast.",

I think you\u2019re going to hit some sonic limitations with the quality of your signal path and the cymbals you are using, but the drums sound pretty good and the space you\u2019re in isn\u2019t terrible. Some notes:\n- Your cymbal mic'ing approach might be a little overly comprehensive. Its nice to have spot mics on each cymbal, but might be worth trying a more traditional overhead approach. It\u2019ll help get a more natural image of the kit and will likely free up some microphones for other spot positions on the drum set or in the room.\n- Your kick drum sounds like a basketball. Theres a few things you can do with tuning, but I would firsttry having some dampening inside. If you like them sounding wide open, then consider taping some felt or paper towels to the inside of the drum shell, at least half way around the interior circumference of the shell. It\u2019ll help quash that bouncing basketball sound.\n- Your snare sounds beefy! Obviously, its going to be song and arrangement dependent, but on its own it sounds like you could voice it a little higher to get it to crack a little more.\n- If you free up some mics by simplifying your cymbal setup, consider having a mic at the \u2018crotch\u2019 position\u2026 picking up the center of the kit. It can be useful for anchoring the mono signal of the drums and gives you something nice to potentially squash or distort down the road.\n- Your room mics sound pretty good with the right EQing!",

If the mix is such that you're taking off a lot of transients on the master buss, it may sound better to ease off the limiter or bypass it entirely so that the live sound engineer will have plenty of headroom to work with and isn't trying to mix around a track that's massively limited. Having that extra headroom and transient energy could be a benefit, thought you'll have to use your ears to make that judgement, and definitely talk to the artist.",

    "question": "I\u2019m not sure if this is a newbie question or not, but I\u2019ll throw it here anyways and see what happens (I hope it helps newbies too). I\u2019m already somewhat aware of the answers I may get, but who knows. Sorry if this is long, I\u2019m bad at short form.\n\nContext: I have been producing music in sincerity for maybe 3 years now, been a hobby since like 16. I\u2019ve started to engineer out of necessity for my individual artistry, but one thing led to the next and I gained a fair bit of skill at it (or so I\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m still pretty insecure, honestly even being around all the really knowledge people on here makes my panic disorder go \ud83d\udcc8). I\u2019ve gotten an internship at a studio as a runner and a session assistant down here (it\u2019s not paid but it\u2019s not exactly unpaid), and I truly have learned a lot (I learn something new on the daily I swear), but I\u2019ve yet to have any true guidance from an established figure yet (which very well may never happen), which I know isn\u2019t necessary, but it absolutely makes me question my own abilities/career decisions despite what happens with my freelance work and I\u2019m curious to know if this is like normal/how other people cope. \n\nLike, I\u2019ve gotten a somewhat okay share of people who pay for my work as an engineer/producer/writer, but the \u201cdo you really know what you\u2019re doing\u201d doubt doesn\u2019t fade easily\u2014even when I\u2019ve been paid by people on like label level budgets, I\u2019m never really registering that success. I\u2019ve had cool moments and landed spotify placements as a mixer for artists, and there\u2019s this part of me that\u2019s still somewhat ashamed that I do a lot more work for free than I care to admit. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the comments on the old episodes that has me spooked (Jon on #61 re: \u201cnot everyone can be a mixer\u201d), but is this like just me or do even some of the really wicked smart people here still feel that\u2014and if so, how do you guys handle the it?",

        "content": "Let me begin by saying that your feelings and experiences are more common than you may realize. It's alright to feel that way. Though I don't believe it's constructive to dwell on them.\n\nIt's not unusual to feel inferior when surrounded by people who are more experienced and talented than you. We've all felt this. The thing is this; you are in exactly the right place and will only benefit from engaging with this environment. Being surrounded by so many professionals and people with experience is absolutely a benefit to your development and someday you'll look back at how far you've come and be amazed by how fluent you are.\n\nLet me drive this point home just a little more: When you were young and learning your native language, nobody put you in a room and expected you to learn the language by conversing with a bunch of inexperienced two year-olds who couldn't speak. Instead, you were surrounded by expert speakers and learned through interactions with people who were leagues ahead of you in their ability to speak the language. Learning to speak is not an easy task, but by immersing yourself in a community of experts you are on the path to mastery and in no time you'll reap the benefits of that exposure.",

        "content": "If your position as a studio runner is paying dividends and you can sustain the lifestyle and afford to go without compensation then continue down that path. It sounds like you're in a position where people may not be giving you the time of day. At this point what a potential mentor figure will be seeking from you is an assurance that you are committed to the path and that their effort will not be wasted on someone who is not committed. \n\nConsidering your position, right now I would recommend adopting an attitude of A) respectful persistence when asking others for insight and help B) private study and a self-starting attitude to make things happen for yourself without their assistance C) actively seeking opportunities to assist, contribute, and be of help to others and D) building your own network of creative collaborators with whom you can continue to create and experiment together.",

Just keep going and developing your existing relationships.\n\nThat feeling of \"I don't really know what I'm doing\" is normal. It happens to most of us. And that's okay. I think you'll be surprised when you someday realize that a tremendous amount of people have no idea what they're doing; even those who seem in control. You do your best in the moment and then build on what you've learned and you do it even better the next time.\n\nDon't be afraid of failure. The most courageous thing that you can do is to put yourself in a situation where you feel vulnerable. You will fail and you will fail again, and finally you will succeed. Then you will find yourself in a situation where you get to fail at bigger, better things. That's the process of self-actualization.\n\nYou should repeatedly strive to put yourself in a position that puts you at the edge of your abilities. That very feeling of being uncomfortable is a sign that you're in the right place. Challenge yourself and go for it. Pushing yourself in this way is the path to growth and achievement.\n\nYou're doing great.",

    "question": "@cian riordan @Adam Thein @Eric Martin thanks for the fantastic responses. This all makes sense. \n\nThe monitoring the repro-head and recording back to digital all in one step note: This is what I am curious about. There's an Otari MX5050 at the studio that I want to mess around with and we have tons of tapes around the studio i'm sure i could use. \n\nSO, Can you sort of passively have the tape machine going without having to operate it actively and just use pro tools, all while getting the tape sound? Like a hardware insert or simply bringing it in and monitoring? \n\nI didn't grow up with Tape, but I want to explore the sounds because so many of my fav sounding records used tape. Many also DIDN'T, but I feel like i've got to figure this out for myself.",

        "content": "Just taking the time to figure out the right changeover strategy and timing so that I could actually make the move once I basically had two fully functioning rigs stood up in parallel. My additional complicating factor is having a laptop that is a dupe of the studio rig, so keeping it all straight and everything in sync is a bit of a puzzle. \n\nI took the transition as the opportunity to phase out some mechanical drives so I had to get some new drives for the M4 instead of re-using the old Time Machine mechanical drive. The M4 mini only has Thunderbolt/USB C ports -- the M1 has USB A's and Thunderbolt/USB C's so I needed a TB hub to get my old USB hub to play on the M4. The move forced me to sort out my iLok strategy between my mastering rig and my production rig because it was quite messy (I ended up getting a 2nd iLok for the M4 to make things way easier between it and the laptop). It was just a lot of little stuff for me. If you're not changing machine form factors and it's mostly a software exercise, then it might be worth it.",

    "question": "Are you looking for resources on writing/production, or mixing? Just like with the record side, there's so much noise from bedroom composers and people that have zero real-world experience. And as Ruairi is always saying, even the people with real success often can't teach what they know. Maybe I'm a bit cranky after an 8 hour delay at the airport yesterday, but Spitfire has gotten quite good at creating \"tutorial\" videos that are thinly veiled advertisements, and many of their libraries are the equivalent of one-knob plugins or CLA vocals. Selling paint-by-numbers solutions to na\u00efve kids who want to get into scoring (They're far from the only ones guilty of this). But to focus on some of the channels I think are actually worth their salt:\n\n8-Bit Music Theory: https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory/videos\nCan be a bit basic at times, but he talks a lot about structure which, IMO, is becoming a lost art in modern scoring.\n\nAnne-Kathrin Dern: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJg1w7F3PKPbSpEF2YOejVjWAg-KcM3Z\nNot the biggest name out there, but she has a no-bullshit way of explaining things about orchestration and theory that is clear and concise. As far as \"teachers,\" I think she's a good one.\n\nAlan Meyerson Waves Sessions: https://youtu.be/h9jZqn5lnw4\nI hesitate to include this. I know for a fact that Alan swapped out a bunch of his go-to plugins to make everything a Waves product. I haven't watched this in awhile, but it's a good insight into how he sets up a big mix session and why he makes some of his decisions. He's also playing to the camera/audience some, so this is a your-mileage-may-vary recommendation.\n\nMcGowen Soundworks: https://www.youtube.com/@McGowanSoundworks/featured\nPhil knows his shit, and goes pretty deep breaking down a few actual mixes, which is pretty rare to find.\n\nIf I think of others, I'll report back. Hope that helps",

There are particular compressors that automatically suck low or high end out of the signal... and for something like bass that can occupy a very crucial part of the low end, that could prove problematic. Usually if I'm compressing bass, it's to bring out the sustain of the low end. So I'll typically set the release & the makeup gain first first to a place where I like how the low end is holding out, then dial in the attack to taste (usually on the medium-to-slow side). Grabby compression on bass can be fun in very specific instances, but I often find it distracting and fatiguing.",

This would be if the bass is doing mostly whole notes, to get it to fill more of the measure. If I\u2019m being specific about attack time... I\u2019m usually (like almost always) getting the punch totally from the kick, so a faster attack usually feels pretty good to me, at least for the compressor not in parallel.

    "question": "How can I get better low end from my kick drum? \n\nMy usual setup is a D112 right outside the hole pointing at the batter, then either a tube condenser or rn a Warm Audio 47 fet, a few feet away pointing at the kick, low passed at 50-100hz and delayed maybe 150-300ms to get the low end nice and full and make some sort of phasing miracle happen. \n\nI am so close to getting the sound I want, it just sounds a little less thick and a little less rock solid than what I am chasing. What am I missing? What can I try?",

If the song is great and there's a basic beat, you're pretty much set. a simple backbeat goes a long way.\n\nAs I've said before, I think the two essential parts of a song are not actually piano/vocal or guitar/vocal but instead beat/vocal. chords are obviously important, usually.

Most of all, the biggest lessons were always about *listening*: Listening to your partners, listening to their intent, and listening to the audience. There is no time to plan.

Electric guitar or synth.\n\nAlso, I use mono -> stereo reverbs a lot because when I was learning, I used the Lexicon PCM-70 a lot which was mono input. It also just made sense to me...not sure it matters a whole lot though ultimately. That is an aside to your question.",

If you mic that amp with a single mic, that mono signal has the reverb as a part of it. When you pan that complete signal, it carries a kind of depth and character that is very different from a stereo reverb or even a separate send. \n\nMono elements with their own reverb can achieve an interesting spatial clarity that you can't get with eq or compression or whatever else you use to give elements their own place in a mix. I use it on all kinds of things from guitars to vocals to drums to whatever.",

For example - if I print a group of stems on THE SAME RENDER then they tend to sum with each other correctly/sample accurately.  It seems in my case to be if I'm printing stems one at a time, then one print may sometimes be offset 1 sample.  So if you are printing multitrack drums, try and print them together, or at the very least, load them into another DAW or a clean session and make sure they are adding back up like you expected ESPECIALLY for parallel processing.\n\nThe main takeaway here should be if you are sending files to another person to work on them you should always check your work so what goes out is what you expected to have go out!",

    "question": "Thank you Edward . I totally follow what you\u2019re saying there . With regards to polarity \u2026..I\u2019m feeling confident in making the correct choices , and yes the delay lines / nudging tracks on close mics feels like I\u2019m staring into the abyss . I\u2019m happy with the sound of the kits I\u2019ve been working on lately , but they are ok to feel \u201clive \u201c and a bit looser . I\u2019m anticipating wanting to get that super tight really punchy / dialed in kit sound I hear on some contemporary records at the moment. Can one achieve that without nudging / delay lines I suppose is what I\u2019m pondering ?",

I\u2019ve heard a lot of pro mixers talk about how they don\u2019t use their outboard stuff as much because they have to jump in and out of projects and it\u2019s not practical to do recalls. My question is .. when  a project comes along that you\u2019re really stoked on do you still stick to keeping things in the box for the convenience or do you break out more analog gear? Just trying to figure out how to get the computer to sound better.",

Also, if I had the guitar I was tracking along to too loud up the center, I would end up compensating or adjusting a bit too much with the subsequent take and I would end up with a quieter take on one side. I had to have the take I was tracking along to really quiet (like minus 28db, even -25 was too loud) in order to get a compelling subsequent take. Barely hearing it was helpful, but I also think it accounted for some of my off-ness in intonation in parts.",

In the case of a sin wave, you have a single fundamental. At the far other end, you have a square wave which has harmonics all up the spectrum of frequency",

        "content": "To illustrate a good example of the difference and why (guessing) Jon would want to clip rather than do this (which would control the transients as you describe)\n\nIf you use a long look ahead, call it a limiter with a long look ahead. That will let the processor know about the transient well before it hits the GR circuit, thus avoiding distortion/harmonics (of course there still could be some artifacts). But even though there will be samples at the threshold, it won\u2019t be a straight line waveform as if you clipped it. It is pushing the waveform down. The waveform itself is actually changed still, so it is not exact but it\u2019s different than clipping.\n\nA clipper just squares it off. Hence harmonics.\n\nThis is why you can limit/compress an instrument like piano, which has a tendency to hear distortion easily, when clipping it would be a disaster (unless you are going for that)",

        "content": "I have a couple distinct phases of my workflow. The \u201ctechnical\u201d phase let\u2019s call it, is all about letting my brain objectively search for the very specific kinds of things that are distracting within the mix at hand. This is much more of a thinking and corrective process than it is a feeling one, even though feeling and taste is 100% involved. This part of the process is to get the mix on a more solid foundation if needed.\n\nThe next phase is where I want to actively NOT be thinking at all. This is why I do the first part separately. I want to be FEELING the music in this phase and not be taken out of it by the vocal resonance at 1.8k at 1:35 in the bridge. I want to turn that part of my brain off so I can focus on the music, the feeling, the lyrics, the intent, the song and try to find where (or if) I can elevate or reveal or better frame the heart of what\u2019s there. This is meant to be the flow state, moving intuitively and viscerally based on what\u2019s coming out of the speakers. This is where efficiency in toolset matters -- where an extremely efficient human-computer interaction matters, where knowing your tools cold matters. I want to reduce latency between feeling and move and I don\u2019t want anything to get in my way. \n\nSo to answer your question: I think about ways to continue to be able to access and preserve that crucial flow state during the time where it matters the most. And it can manifest a million ways that aren\u2019t directly related to mastering at all: taking a walk, working out, doing a J, listening to a new record, checking Discord, unplugging, whatever. And yes, sometimes it also means refining my template or my Streamdeck shortcuts or creating a new preset.",

Efficient method goes like this:\n\nPT Downmixer stock plugin is the one for this (it collapses stereo channels to mono) - flip the phase of one side in the GUI and save that as your user default. If you insert your Downmixer on a faux stereo track, it\u2019ll immediately silence it, so you can happily split and delete what you don\u2019t need. \n\n(Check the meters though, sometimes ambience or other subtle stereo info isn\u2019t very audible unless cranked.)\n\nIf the stereo track contains slightly panned mono information, pushing/pulling either of the faders in Downmixer will quickly get it to cancel, and you can note how much extra gain you need to add or subtract when level matching in the final step (below). Obviously if it\u2019s deliberately panned info, you can either just leave the track stereo or match the pan position by ear (I prefer to do this because I like mono channels to behave like mono channels, and also half the CPU you\u2019d use on a stereo track).\n\nFinally, use clip gain to add 3dB to the resulting mono channel, and obviously pan it centre. This makes up for the level change according to default pan laws in Tools (-3dB).",

    "question": "Noah covered a lot, but a few (also stream of consciousness) thoughts to add:\n\nThere is no formula to when to take the leap. It's helpful to have some money in the bank, because it's going to take awhile for things to start happening. The more connections you have, the more in-roads you've made, the easier it will be to drum up work in music and keep the lights on. The less responsibilities and overhead you have, the easier the beginning stages of freelance life will be.\n\nDon't think about your music career in terms of the same metrics as your day job, you're burnt out on it for a reason. So instead of \"am I making what I made before,\" think \"can I survive on this for now?\" and if not, \"what will get me to a place that I can afford to pursue this dream?\"\n\nAny music job can be a boon for your career, and chances are you don't know where the opportunities will come from. The Beatles became the Beatles by playing cover songs at shady clubs, honing their sound and learning to play with each other. For someone else, that would've been a mindless, thankless gig with no upside. When they started playing better gigs, they were ready and stood out because of it.\n\nHow you do anything is how you do everything - if you're an intern at a studio cleaning up trash, you may be around huge artists and engineers. If they see you as dependable, friendly, going above-and-beyond, there's a tiny chance that a life-changing opportunity could emerge. Likewise, if they see you doing a sloppy job, that's how they're going to assume you'd be in the room, too.",

    "question": "Now that the basics are happening \u2014 kick and snare are really standing on their own two feet and in a place to drive the song \u2014 I\u2019ll start bringing in other instruments in the mix and getting a sense of how things are adding up. Usually starting with bass, guitars, keys and finally vocals. Some people do vocals first \u2014 that\u2019s never worked for me. Once you have a balance of the track, you can start really incorporating some of the overheads and room mics to give the drums more dimension and flavor. If the engineer really fucked the dog with the recording \u2014 or the room just sounds bad \u2014 I won\u2019t spend too much time making them work\u2026 I\u2019ll just get to manufacturing something that sounds cool. This could be leaning into a spring reverb, or a fun delay, or using other creative reverbs to get the drums have the space you want. I\u2019m a big fan of un-natural sounding drums\u2026 distorted spring reverb panned hard left with a slap panned hard right? Why not! If someone serves you shit, shovel them ice cream.\n\nToms will literally be the last thing I work on. It\u2019s just a matter of seeing what\u2019s missing from the overall picture and filling in the blanks with the spot mics. I don\u2019t like to trim the regions because I might find that when I\u2019m gating, some of the bleed sounds good from the track. Sometimes, if the engineer did their job, the multi-mic recording will be really complete and will need the tom mics for the overall sound\u2026 so no gating at all. Again, all depends on what you\u2019re working with.\n\nOnce I move on with the rest of my mix, I\u2019ll find myself doing EQ moves on the drum buss and treating it more like one instrument to get other things happening in the mix\u2026 only doing small tweaks to the individual sounds.\n\nI hope this all makes sense?",

        "content": "A tangent\u2026\n\nI\u2019m lucky to have spent many years in a great studio with lots of great drums & gear\u2026 not to mention being mentored by one of the great engineers of our time. Having this perspective is massively useful in mixing other peoples tracks, because I feel I have a north star of what good drums can sound like if they\u2019re recorded and performed properly. It used to be that my starting point for mixing drums were working with tracks that I had recorded myself\u2026 and most of the above problems were solved before the mix stage. These days, with smaller budgets and time constraints, its very rare that this is a possibility.\n\nI\u2019m including this drum tracking session from a few years ago that I recorded at Barefoot. It was for a project that Matt was producing that never saw the light of day. But we went all out with the drum setup in the big room, through the console, and had a great drummer. This might be useful for some people who have never gotten properly recorded drum tracks\u2026 to get a sense of how good thigns can sound before the \u2018mix\u2019 stage. These are the tracks that were printed into Pro Tools off of the console, and the three busses were prints of the outboard compressor busses we were using while monitoring. It\u2019s unlikely these busses would get used in mixing, but they\u2019re a good reference to what we were listening to in the room while we were tracking. But as you\u2019ll notice, the individual drum blend can stand on it\u2019s own two feet. Hopefully this is useful as well.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

Passive use proper speaker cables which are unshielded and TS.\n\nSpeaker cables don't have any shielding because they are expecting to see a super hot signal.

At the receiving end of the connection, there is what's called a differential amplifier. Short version, a differential amp polarity inverts cold and combines it with hot, thereby reducing common mode noise by cancellation (and also some distortion, but we'll get back to that later).",

        "content": "- **More samples (slices) per second equals a better representation of the analog waveform.** Within half the band of the sample rate (say up to 22.05k for 44.1k) this is demonstrably not true. I know that is confounding, but digital and information theory is basically miraculous\n- **We can hear/feel/sense sounds above 20k.** We truly really cannot and if you experiment with significant energy above 20k you\u2019ll actually see problems creep in for electronics and speakers etc. Information above 20k is not our friend (space for harmonic information to live without aliasing back excepted)\n- **Working at multiples of 44.1k is better because the sample rate conversion will work better.** This used to be a little bit true a long time ago but hasn\u2019t been for a long time. Use the SRC in iZotope RX on it\u2019s stock preset to 44.1 and you are in pretty good shape\n- **Digital EQs work better at higher sample rates because of cramping.** Cramping was an esoteric problem with older digital EQs that looked bad on analyzers but never actually sounded very bad. It\u2019s a solved problem nowadays with most EQs.\n- **Video and film is at 48k so we must start there.** Yes film and TV still work at 48k (although YouTube specs 44.1 now) but I have sent a million tracks for sync at 44.1 and it gets dropped in with SRC and away we go",

Is the recommended route to go to the Aurora from Pro tools, then over ADAT from the Lynx to the grace (assuming you need to have an ADAT card in the Lynx and the digital Grace) and then from the Grace over AES to the PMCs ?",

But I digress, that wasn\u2019t my original question lol. Original question was whether phase shift from EQ on the master is audible?",

    "question": "I\u2019m wondering about general principles of mixing a drum kit , from the perspective of experienced engineers \u2026\u2026when it comes to the particular drums ( kick in and out for example ) which are close mic\u2019d with two different mics, when it comes to the tiny timing differences of when that drum beat arrives at the kick in \u2026.and  the kick out \u2026..are you on principle , leaving that phase relationship captured on the consequent drum multitrack \u2026.or are we on principle aligning those kick in and and out tracks so the transients can align bang on with no (millisecond ) out of phase relationship . My thoughts are I want those kicks hitting spot on together , but then I\u2019m corrupting the phase relationship of the bleed in the kick out to the rest of the kit . So are y\u2019all then chasing this phase shifting around the kit multitracks and trying to build a drum mix that represents the sounds as though they all arrived at the close mics at the same instant \u2026..or are these discrepancies of the sound travelling different distances to the close mics \u2026\u2026to be preserved ? I\u2019ve experimented and will continue to do so , but I wonder if there\u2019s a consensus principle around this time / distance to phase aspect of recording and mixing drums ?",

    "question": "I think a few things can factor in... sometimes there are contracts, maybe you need your lawyer to read it or at a minimum spend time to go over it yourself. Negotiation could be more intense, deliverables could be more scrutinized and annoying. Often deadlines are tighter/more strict.  Dealing with them dictating terms of payment IE when/how you get paid, as opposed to indie gigs where you can set your own payment terms and most people will be happy to follow them. And for me personally, the label gigs ive had (not a ton but a few at least), i ask for more because I know the budget generally will be higher than most of my local indie clients. And TBH it feels more like what im worth, than what i normally get paid by local artists without label support.  Thats partially because i probably dont ask for enough for my indie gigs, and partially just my location/client base.\n\nTBH  I also dont have a problem morally with asking a corporation to pay me more for a service than an individual that is paying out of pocket... partially for the reasons listed and partially because if they're playing the capitalism game, why cant i when im working with them? Not to the point where i feel im being greedy, but, just advocating for myself a litlte stronger than i normally do.",

    "question": "For the second question, the \"car test\" is a staple mostly because both sonically and psychologically, the car is a great counterbalance to the context and precision of the studio. \n\nThe car is also the place most people used to listen to the most music as a fan. It still is for many, but I say \"used to\" because a lot of people's #1 music listening environment outside of a studio is the phone/ headphones/ AirPods. \n\nSo my \"car test\" is now AirPod max headphones walking around my neighborhood in LA or taking the tube in London. \n\nBut the car also has its advantages because it's noisy and imperfect and NOT isolated like the studio and headphones. You can't listen as precisely in a car, which often tells you very quickly whether you can hear the important parts of your song (can you hear the vocal? Does the low end feel good?).",

Kick and bass might arrive to one shared bus pre 2hus if I want to clip them pre 2 bus . Tend not to clip much anymore tho  . All my drums go into  three parallels (a clean a distortion and a comp ) and those are what arrive to the drum bus . It was cians article that educated me to just how much \u201ceq\u201d I can do this way via distortion . This was a real level up for me . \nI do the same thing for my kick and basses and include a blown out high passed parallel to feather in at the end to tickle the tweeters once I\u2019ve balanced the mix at the end .",

    "question": "Sup everyone. Just wanted to check in here for some morale/mental advice, and possibly some technical advice. \n\nBasically ive been workig with this artist for almost a year now, and he\u2019s by far my biggest client (both how often he books me and how many listeners). We\u2019ve grown really close personally, but we are currently in the midst of doing a mix for his favorite song hes done yet. He expressed to me that he is frustrated that after all this time, i am still unable to get in the ballpark for his vocal mixes within the first handful of versions. He expressed that he\u2019d rsther a much more formulaic copy and paste approach, but i explained to him that every song is different, etc etc. in the end, we ended up importing the vocal chain from one of his older songs and it definitely sounded better, having me questioning my skills with his stuff and leaving me feeling a bit embarrassed because i worked for 2 hours on the other vocals that sounded worse (he is sending me raw untuned vocals). Lemme preface this by saying that i dont have this issue with any other client ever, and ive gotten amazing feedback from our final mixes that we\u2019ve put out, just not the inital ones. Anybody ever struggle with this before? Not sure how i should take this and how i can be better for the sake of my work with him and others.",

So you\u2019re not alone there. \n\nBut also- you don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel every time.

    "question": "If I get through the kick and snare and find things starting to sound too \u2018scooped\u2019, I\u2019ll try and fill in some blanks with parallel sansamp or the distortion buss. I like the distortion buss technique because if offers a consistency across all the tracks and you dont just have a distorted snare drum but pristine clean toms. Often its a Decapitator with a low shelf going into it killing some low end. I\u2019ll solo this buss, get it to sound crunchy but not messy, then un-solo, bring the fader to neg-infinity, and blend it into taste. You\u2019d be surprised how much excitement you get without totally fucking up the aesthetic of the drums.\n\nAs for samples? Sure! I\u2019ve you\u2019ve gone all-balls on these tracks and you\u2019re still lacking what you think you need, then no shame in supplementing with samples. \u2018Supplement\u2019 being the key word here. I use the Massey DRT to extract MIDI from the kick & snare mics and then use Battery to trigger my samples. I have a few samples that just solve various problems for me. Sometimes just giving me the low end sub, or a 100 cycle knock. They can be helpful to punch your way through phasing issues and really get the meat and potatoes of the rhythm track holding its own. I will never \u2018replace\u2019 with a sample\u2026 there\u2019s always something useful in the recorded track if you try hard enough.",

        "content": "A tangent\u2026\n\nI\u2019m lucky to have spent many years in a great studio with lots of great drums & gear\u2026 not to mention being mentored by one of the great engineers of our time. Having this perspective is massively useful in mixing other peoples tracks, because I feel I have a north star of what good drums can sound like if they\u2019re recorded and performed properly. It used to be that my starting point for mixing drums were working with tracks that I had recorded myself\u2026 and most of the above problems were solved before the mix stage. These days, with smaller budgets and time constraints, its very rare that this is a possibility.\n\nI\u2019m including this drum tracking session from a few years ago that I recorded at Barefoot. It was for a project that Matt was producing that never saw the light of day. But we went all out with the drum setup in the big room, through the console, and had a great drummer. This might be useful for some people who have never gotten properly recorded drum tracks\u2026 to get a sense of how good thigns can sound before the \u2018mix\u2019 stage. These are the tracks that were printed into Pro Tools off of the console, and the three busses were prints of the outboard compressor busses we were using while monitoring. It\u2019s unlikely these busses would get used in mixing, but they\u2019re a good reference to what we were listening to in the room while we were tracking. But as you\u2019ll notice, the individual drum blend can stand on it\u2019s own two feet. Hopefully this is useful as well.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

    "question": "Hey all, got a question about sidechaining in Ableton, specifically kicks and bass/808s. I normally just use a generic compressor when sidechaining with a soft ratio, no attack/short release, and pretty low threshold (-18 to -24) and it usually works pretty well. Sometimes however the compressor alone isn't enough to dip the 808 and allow the kick to punch through cleanly. I was going to try using F6 instead, but I can't figure out how to sidechain the kick signal itself into F6 (in Ableton at least). Any tips?",

With the stock Ableton plugins this happens automatically when you engage the sidechain but for 3rd party you have to add it manually.  I don't have F6 but looking up an image of the plugin it looks like the option is in the bottom right (2nd picture).\n\nIf that doesn't work then I'm not sure what's going wrong.",

The first thing that stands out to me is that you're using a soft ratio. You need to crank that ratio up to at *least* a 4:1 ratio, but you might be even better off with an 8:1 or higher ratio. You need a high ratio to get the deeper ducking effect that it seems you're seeking.\n\nUsing a soft ratio will never get you a big duck unless you have the threshold pulled all of the way down. And even then it's probably going to have issues recovering correctly after each duck.",

        "content": "- **Higher sample rates reduce aliasing.** There is effectively no difference between 44.1 and 48k here but a meaningful difference at 96k and above. Aliasing is caused by non linear processes like distortion, and dynamics processing (compressor or limiter). Lots online about what it is and why it happens but you can sum it up by saying it\u2019s an inharmonic, digital sounding hash that can feel bright but in a kind of ugly way (but remember sometimes ugly is good)\n- **Higher sample rates reduce the impact of Anti Imaging and Anti Aliasing filters in AD to DA converters.** Filtering is necessary for accurate capture and replay of analog signals, and it in the early days of digital it used to be a real challenge. Now it\u2019s basically a solved problem, but if you are doing acoustic music, with delicate transient information there is still a small but real advantage to higher rates\n- **Higher sample rates reduce overshoot and inter sample peaks on limiters.** This really only matters if you are sending your loud mixes directly to release, otherwise your mastering girl or guy should handle that",

        "content": "- **More samples (slices) per second equals a better representation of the analog waveform.** Within half the band of the sample rate (say up to 22.05k for 44.1k) this is demonstrably not true. I know that is confounding, but digital and information theory is basically miraculous\n- **We can hear/feel/sense sounds above 20k.** We truly really cannot and if you experiment with significant energy above 20k you\u2019ll actually see problems creep in for electronics and speakers etc. Information above 20k is not our friend (space for harmonic information to live without aliasing back excepted)\n- **Working at multiples of 44.1k is better because the sample rate conversion will work better.** This used to be a little bit true a long time ago but hasn\u2019t been for a long time. Use the SRC in iZotope RX on it\u2019s stock preset to 44.1 and you are in pretty good shape\n- **Digital EQs work better at higher sample rates because of cramping.** Cramping was an esoteric problem with older digital EQs that looked bad on analyzers but never actually sounded very bad. It\u2019s a solved problem nowadays with most EQs.\n- **Video and film is at 48k so we must start there.** Yes film and TV still work at 48k (although YouTube specs 44.1 now) but I have sent a million tracks for sync at 44.1 and it gets dropped in with SRC and away we go",

Turning down the M channel on elements that I want to have be more background surrounding elements with a plugin like CenterOne is actually one of my most common mix moves and it sounds great.\n\nA good friend of mine who has made one of my favorite mixes of all time constantly talks about his use of M/S processing. I don\u2019t do much M/S other than levels and stereo imagining, but my boi does regularly and he sounds great. \n\nAll that to say: River,  It\u2019s worth being careful and listening to what could be getting fucked up in your midside processing, I wouldn\u2019t be M/S EQing personally, and you should generally only do M/S moves with speakers and generally not with headphones, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you should shy away from M/S all together if it sounds really good to you. Lots of great engineers are using it all the time.",

        "content": "I started getting serious about recording while I was in college (studying chemistry). I was playing bass in a band at the time and I was the only one that had any sort of decent recording equipment. I found myself being the guy recording all of the band's demos before we went into a 'proper studio'. Eventually, we realized my demos were sounding better than the ones we paid other people to record! Meanwhile, I started assisting (for free) at a local small recording studio and met a really great mentor. The studio was small and its business was mostly weekend warrior type stuff \u2013 nobody really notable. That being said, it was a working studio \u2013 and booked almost 6-7 days a week. The producer was the big fish in the small pond and had a great repeat clientele. Most of the music was not my cup of tea \u2013 but this proved to be a good thing as I was exposed to all sorts of different styles and it allowed me to be comfortable in genres of music which I normally wouldn't gravitate towards. It just made me comfortable around music and musicians in general.\n\nOnce I graduated and decided I wasn't going to use my chemistry degree, I ended up helping the producer build a bigger studio complex from the ground up. I learned an insane amount of stuff during this period \u2013 whether it was researching which Pro Tools system we would need to helping design the wiring layout to actually implementing it all. Ultimately, after months of hard work (and lots of borrowed money) the studio was complete and it was ready for business. I worked here for 2 years or so until I got introduced to Eric Valentine through former Street To Nowhere guitarist Matt Radosevich in Los Angeles. He needed a new full-time assistant and so I hopped at the opportunity and moved to LA \u2013 leaving behind the studio and crew I helped build (they're still going today and they're doing great).",

What I realized very quickly is that the process is fundamentally the same with people of all levels. You get in a room, you make a plan, and you execute it. However, when you've got a major label backing you, there's many more resources available, enabling you to spend more time (and money) making the record... although in my experience this can be both a blessing and a curse!\n\nI assisted Eric for a few years and eventually started networking with more local Los Angeles artists and was able to mix and produce their stuff out of Eric's studio. He was very cool about letting me use the space when we weren't working on bigger projects. He set a very high standard and made it clear that anything that left our studio had to sound really, really great. After assisting and working on my own stuff for several years, Eric then hired me as his full-time main engineer and now I'm on call to work on him for any of his projects. This has been amazing in so many ways as I get to work on high-level commercial music and apply all of my own sensibilities to the process \u2013 as well as the stuff I've learned from Eric over the years.\n\nObviously my tale is one in a million and there's not a day that goes my where I don't realize how lucky I am. Now that I've worked full time recording music for almost 8 years, I've realized there are certain things you need to have to be successful:",

I speed it up, slow it down, use various parts, cut and paste - basically just to get something that inspires me during composition.

Should also say that I recognized your name immediately, I had a chance to produce a mini mansions show some years ago and became a big fan of that band.",

        "content": "Oh fuck yea, MM forever! I usually just trim the input of my final limiter (almost always the Ozone maximizer) 5dB and call it a day. All of the compression/limiting/clipping thats happening on various busses beforehand stay the same. I try to not lean on the final limiting stage to heavily in building the 'loudenss' of the mix, but I know that's not the case for everybody. If there was an instance where it was really part of the sound, I'd just leave it and send it off. Any mastering engineer worth their salt should be OK working with whatever you send them. If there are glaring issues, they're likely to bring it up... but most mixers I know don't even peel back the limiter a little... so the loudness is fully baked into the mix.",

Once it got to be too much, I started looking for an entertainment lawyer. Ended up with a guy who used to manage Travis Truit or something and he offered to write my ex-producer a letter for free. Really nice and helpful guy - for the little guys. So, yeah. Thank goodness I'm self-produced now and don't need anything from anybody, but the next time I do get involved with anyone in a production capacity or mixing or whatever and I feel like I'm deserving of a certain something, I intend to call Sam up and get things squared away before I start. Also, I'll add that the toll it took on my health - struggling with that producer basically in isolation, wasting time, feeling powerless, etc. etc. - was not negligible. That situation actually made me physically ill, and none of us artist types deserve that. So - take care of yourself.",

    "question": "Mixing strategies for guitar band music : \n\nI\u2019m v familiar with effective gain staging and transient / tone shaping of composite parts of a mix  for rnb and hip hop \u2026..however not so for the relationship between rythm guitars and vocals in guitar bands music . I wondered if the vets had developed any simple guiding principle about this particular relationship when finding a good balance . The guitar as an instrument is presenting me with a lot of questions about masking and level relative to the vocal , it sits so close/ across many of  the vocal Hz . How do ya ll approach this interplay . Are you scooping  700 - 2 kHz for example to make space for the vocal ? Etc etc . And this is for rhythm guitars only . \n\nI started as a guitar player in a band so I totally see the guitarists view on music , but I left guitar bands in my teens and am only returning to this music now as a mixer moving into new genres from club /rnb / hip hop background . Recurring dilemma : Drums bass and guitar no vocal , the mixes bang . Put the vocal in . Guitar and vocals aren\u2019t speaking together . Drums bass and vocal no guitar , mixes are banging .",

In fact if the guitars only lived 700-2k I bet your vocal would pop easily. (Hard to tell without source material of course.)\n\nBut, philosophically, it\u2019s way more about panning. You guitars can be huge if they\u2019re on the sides.",

See what if anything you hear.\nI\u2019m not deep enough on this to have the answer on a plate, but I think when we talk about hearing phase shifts on a single track, the times when that will be noticeable are when we have a lot of harmonically related content and they can either create constructive or destructive interference patterns depending on their phase. You\u2019re going to see changes in peak amplitude and I think that\u2019s a big factor. But yeah it\u2019s subtle stuff and not always the most significant factor in how things sound",

I\u2019m pretty new to working with lawyers/a manager, but have been the last 6 months or so. My contracts include the credit and wording of the credit. That said, I got hired to work on a fairly big record recently as an engineer for the producer who was mixing. I ended up doing a very significant portion of the actual mixing, but only got an additional mixing credit. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  I waited until after to address the credit, but in retrospect I should have brought this up when it was clear the roles were developing. (I think? Chime in if you think otherwise!) Also I chose to not rock the boat too hard, as I wanted to maintain the relationships, and have since gotten hired to do more work for the band.

Nowadays, in the computer, it's less important and just comes down to workflow. Sometimes some mixes call for a more uniform reverb to tie tracks together... in this case putting it on a send makes more sense. But there's no rules anymore, and if you don't like that workflow, then fuck it. Do it your way. There's no right or wrong on this.",

Could it yield some fun effects? Maybe?! I'm sorta with Matt... if you're already in the computer, and unless you're sending out to something with a shitton of tubes or transformers, you're probably best staying in the box. Some 'pre-amps' that I do come out of the box for distortion on a regular basis are: Ampex 351 (god bless this thing) and the Scully 280. But I'm looking for real distortion that I'm typically using in parallel, nothing subtle. I use Spectre/Saturn/Decapitator/Neutron for that stuff.",

    "question": "Process/Theory:\nI see lots of people\u2019s previous responses say they begin with getting the overheads to sound great and then start blending in close mics. If the drums were recorded by someone who knew what they were doing, with a good sounding kit, in a nice room \u2014 this would be a wonderful way to approach things. However 90% of the time that\u2019s not the case with tracks that come my way. So I\u2019m solving fro two problems \u2014 making the drums:\n1) The foundational rhythm element. It doesn\u2019t matter how good tonally your drums sound, they need to fill specific duties to carry the rhythm of the song. This is usually problem solving with phase within the elements of the drum set and then mostly getting the kick and snare to sit right around the rest of the instruments. Literally getting the right transients in the right frequency ranges \u2014 agnostic of \u2018tone\u2019 and \u2018vibe\u2019.\n2) The sense of space for the mix. The drums are a huge part of this\u2026 and the foundation for the aesthetic of a mix. Is it a tight space? Big verby snare? This is all great, but will rarely deal with this stuff until #1 is taken care of. So my process starts with close mics.\n\nAfter poking around and listening to the close mic various options to get a sense of what I\u2019m working with, I\u2019ll start with getting everything in phase. Solo the kick drum mics and get those in phase with each-other. If they don\u2019t add up, I\u2019ll start playing with HP filters at various Q\u2019s to try and get things closer. You\u2019d be surprised what you can get away with even when things are even 90 degrees out. Then, I\u2019ll start introducing more spot mics (snare, toms, HH) and start getting things in focus with just phase flips. By the time you get to the overheads and rooms, you should have all the spot mics in phase with each-other so then you can get a better sense of how the overheads are going to play into the game.",

        "content": "I'll gate everything with the Pro-G. Usually as tight as I can while sometimes automating threshhold to make sure ghostnotes don't get lost. I'll peel back the ratio once I have everything triggering properly to let some bleed in to taste. Sometimes I'll only gate 2-3 dB to just get something to pop. Sometimes its in a vaccum.\nI will very rarely compress individual drum mics. And I pray that the recording engineer didn\u2019t either. I like most of my compression to come from the busses. It sounds more natural to my ear and allows you to get away with a more compressed, exciting sound than just whacking the close mics. I\u2019ll find at the beginning my drum mixes will be very \u2018pokey\u2019 \u2014 I want each drum to sound explosive and over the top. That way when i start compressing them, they maintain their transient quality when they start getting dynamically reduced.\n\nI\u2019m always cutting tons of 250-350 out of the kick drums and trying to manufacture any attack with saturation instead of EQ. Having a SansAmp or a Saturn plugin adding high end always sounds more natural to me than just additive EQ. I\u2019m always very wary of the 2-5khz region, and find even-order harmonics are the best bet to fill in the blanks there.\n\nI tend to like my snare drums warm, so often low-shelving down the super low end and keeping the 150-300 \u2018boosh\u2019 intact. I try to avoid using HPF on drum mics because at this point, things should be relatively in phase, so if I put a filter on, it\u2019s going to throw the whole kaboodle off whack. Shelves are your friend here. And same as with the kick drums re: adding high end \u2014 I\u2019m wary off adding the snap in the 2-5khz range, I\u2019ll try and have the body of the snare drum really singing so I only have to add a little bit of top end, often above 5khz just for some air.",

        "content": "A tangent\u2026\n\nI\u2019m lucky to have spent many years in a great studio with lots of great drums & gear\u2026 not to mention being mentored by one of the great engineers of our time. Having this perspective is massively useful in mixing other peoples tracks, because I feel I have a north star of what good drums can sound like if they\u2019re recorded and performed properly. It used to be that my starting point for mixing drums were working with tracks that I had recorded myself\u2026 and most of the above problems were solved before the mix stage. These days, with smaller budgets and time constraints, its very rare that this is a possibility.\n\nI\u2019m including this drum tracking session from a few years ago that I recorded at Barefoot. It was for a project that Matt was producing that never saw the light of day. But we went all out with the drum setup in the big room, through the console, and had a great drummer. This might be useful for some people who have never gotten properly recorded drum tracks\u2026 to get a sense of how good thigns can sound before the \u2018mix\u2019 stage. These are the tracks that were printed into Pro Tools off of the console, and the three busses were prints of the outboard compressor busses we were using while monitoring. It\u2019s unlikely these busses would get used in mixing, but they\u2019re a good reference to what we were listening to in the room while we were tracking. But as you\u2019ll notice, the individual drum blend can stand on it\u2019s own two feet. Hopefully this is useful as well.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

I find Audacity to be excellent for pre pro because the click track feature and the time stretch feature are so incredibly malleable, and with many of my songs switching bpms all over the place, I rely on both of those features heavily during the initial crafting stage. Combined with their \"bpm markers plugin\" you're cutting and pasting and sliding around like no ones business. Audacity really is so, soo good for so many things. Many downsides, but for laying down scratch tracks nothing I've used compares. I could go further, but won't for the sake of brevity - and I don't want to get flamed. lol.",

I've been playing with this effect for about 25 years and even yesterday had an artist at the house where we did vocal takes at different distances from the mic. never stop experimenting and learning!",

Close mic, stacked harmonies with the same mic as the lead vocal also sound nice. Just depends what you're after. Experiment and let your ears decide!",

The transients(which for me are absolutely crucial to hear when producing or mixing) are almost inaudible on the M50s, while decently audible on the 770s. I do not find the M50s or the 770s even close to \"well balanced\", they both are a bit too budget for that distinction(they both have extreme presence peaks at their respective frequencies). I know someone who is very happy with the Shure SRH940s and Shure 1840s for critical listening(same drivers, I think). The M50s and 770s are both pretty much unusable in the low end under 50-60hz for me, I don't feel they translate well there. A few mastering engineers use the Blue closed-back headphones as a low-end reference, they would probably be worth a try. Audeze stuff is pretty good for transient response, but more expensive.",

        "content": "I would tell them there's a few things to consider when pressing vinyl:\n1) Mastering is especially important as it\u2019s the real bridge between the music and the mechanical production of the record. I had the great pleasure of mastering a few records for vinyl with Doug Sax (give him a google) and there\u2019s a lot more to the process than modern mastering for digital services. They will actually cut the acetate disc which will be what manufacturers use to make the metal stamper that actually molds the records. A lot of thought goes into this process such as the width of the grooves to accommodate bass frequencies, etc. If you want a good sounding record, there\u2019s no way around working with a seasoned professional.\n\n2) Side lengths are important, as is track order. The more music you put on a side of vinyl, the less fidelity it will have as a whole. There will be sacrifices in the manufacturing to accommodate all of the music, so it\u2019s best to keep your side lengths under 20 mins. Closer to 15 mins per side is ideal sonically, but sometimes that means doing double records and that just gets expensive. Also the order in which the tracks play on each side plays a part. The songs at the beginning of the side have more bandwidth and less distortion\u2026 it basically diminishes the closer you get to the center. Whatever the last track on the side is will just sound worse. It\u2019s a flaw in the medium\u2026 so think about that.",

        "content": "3) Not all manufacturers are created equal. With vinyl pressing plants months behind on their bookings, there are many budget plants that seem to be doing things for cheaper and quicker. You get what you pay for. QRP in Kansas are the best in the business. RTI in CA used to be the gold standard, but they dogged me real hard on a project about 10 years ago and never made things right. Even Doug Sax had to step in to set them straight.\n\nThe short of it is, if someone is venturing down the path of manufacturing vinyl for their project \u2014 *especially* if it\u2019s self funded \u2014 they have to ask what they\u2019re really looking to achieve. If they want a high-quality, analog preservation of their record for all to enjoy, then they need to be prepared to spend some real coin to achieve good results. If they just want a physical item to sell at shows and toss in a download code \u2014 that\u2019s OK too \u2014 but it will still be pricey, and probably won\u2019t sound great if you do it on the cheap.

It finally clicked that many folks these days (especially in the pop world) are getting stems to mix from \u2014 not full multitrack sessions \u2014 and often not real drumsets/instruments in real rooms. In my world, for better or worse, I\u2019m almost always getting multitrack files. So the prospect of only spending 2-3 hours on a mix is just impossible. That will often times barely get me past the drum sound! So for us mere mortals that are still stuck mixing real instruments, here\u2019s my process for approaching drum mixing.",

This has evolved over many years and has taken many forms, but it\u2019s really just a good starting point for me and speeds up my workflow quite a bit. I\u2019ve got three main busses that feed into a master drum buss. \u2018DRUM SUB\u2019 is my uncompressed (or lightly compressed) buss. \u2018DRUM PAR\u2019 is my heavily compressed buss, and \u2018DRUM DIST\u2019 is my parallel distortion buss. I don\u2019t necessarily always use these, but having them ready to go makes it easier to quickly audition different ideas. Sometimes I\u2019ll duplicate one or two of them to get another flavor involved. Again, everything to taste. \n\nAlso in the template are some very basic aux\u2019s I find myself using often. There are two parallel SansAmp busses. I have two because often times if I use one on the kick drum, it rarely works for the snare drum, so I have a second one ready to go. There\u2019s also a \u2018SNARE SLAP\u2019 and \u2018SNARE GATE VERB\u2019 that rarely get used but if I need to inject a little mojo, they\u2019re a good starting point.\n\nThe \u2018D SUB TRIM\u2019 is just a master fader controlling everything going into the bussing, so if I get a little overzealous with level, I can manage the gain staging quickly without having volume automation grouped. These three (sometimes more) busses then feed into the final \u2018DRUM MSTR\u2019 , where I\u2019ll do final overall EQ tweaks and level adjustments.",

I don\u2019t do a huge amount of mixing live drums that I didn\u2019t track but this is usually the single biggest improvement. 2. I start with the over heads and work from there, usually filtering a touch of low end but I really like to keep these as a full picture of the whole kit. 3. Subtle saturation, I find an instance of Saturn works wonders on some kicks and a lot of other drum sources. 4. Gating and compression, can work wonders to clean up a kick or snare, always checking to make sure that any processing is actually an improvement. 5. Additive eq, boost those pleasing freqs! I should note that 95% of this whole process happens while listening to everything, I don\u2019t usually solo any one element to do any of this (except to start the gating maybe)",

    "question": "I have a bit of a weird technical question I can\u2019t wrap my head around. That I\u2019ve never really thought about before. (might be over thinking it). I\u2019m gonna completely simplify and exaggerate. When we talk about making room in a mix, usually we usually talk about giving each sound it\u2019s own space in the mix. I understand this from a frequency point of view. But when talking about mono vs wide sounds I\u2019m kinda lost. \n\nIf let\u2019s say i have 2 sounds, one is mono and one is wide.  Would that leave one with more headroom compared to having the same 2 sounds both in mono? \n\nOr would the wide sound take up more head room, because to make a sound wide, it needs to be different on both sides. But doesn\u2019t that mean that you would have double the amount of signal as you would need two different versions of the same sound playing at once to achieve wideness? \n\nFx a mono guitar and a mono vocal both centre vs a completely anti phase guitar and mono vocal. I know the latter will make each sound more intelligible but wouldn\u2019t you at the same time provide more information resulting in less headroom?",

You can add delays, phasing, pitch shifting, etc to make it sound 'wide'... and yes, it will theoretically take up more space in the mix. As far as taking up more headroom, there's just too many variables to figure out there. But if you have the mono sound on a mono track, and the mono sound on a stereo track, with modern pan laws, they would both take up the same headroom.",

        "content": "Neat question. If you're mixing in two channels (L/R) the headroom should be the same no matter where you pan it (with some caveats which we'll get to). If you have a kick drum panned dead center coming in at -6dB on your digital meter it's going to be coming in at -6 in both the L channel and -6 in the R channel. Each channel has it's own independent headroom that doesn't affect the other (until we add a limiter with linked channels), so let's simplify things a bit and mute the R channel for now:\n\nNow you have your L channel with the kick panned \"center\" and the R channel is muted.  If you were to pan this kick to the hard left it would not affect the volume of the L channel at all. That's because the panning effect is created by subtracting gain from the R channel only. Making the kick sound like it's leaning to the left.\n\nNow there's one big element I've left out so far, and that's *pan law*. Ableton Live has a -3dB pan law. This means that sounds panned to the center are reduced by 3dB. Because if a sound is being played at the same volume by both the L and R channels then their voltage will combine to create a sound that is louder than intended. So all DAWs and mixers compensate for this added loudness by turning down the gain of sounds as they are panned closer to the center (and shared between both speakers).\n\nSince all modern DAWs and mixers have pan laws implemented, what happens when you now pan the kick hard left is that it ends up becoming 3dB louder than it was when it was panned in the center, because it is no longer being turned down by the pan law when it\u2019s centered.",

        "content": "So to answer your question, yes, a sound will technically take up more headroom when hard-panned (or spread), because the pan law makes it a little louder when panned to the extremes. However because this also makes the sound perceptually louder you\u2019re likely to turn the sound down a little bit to compensate for the boost in volume, thus buying you back the headroom you\u2019d have lost.\n\nI may have missed a few things. Other DAWs use other pan laws, and admittedly I'm not up to date on the minutiae of it all. So don\u2019t hesitate to amend, or correct me on this stuff, folks.",

If you want to get good, it is aactually pretty easy and anyone can do it with the right mindset and patience(key word here). Firstly stop playing on and off, just play as often as you can preferably every day if not every other day.  Stop worrying about scales chords and theory, and just play. Learn as many songs as you can, like really learn them. Your ear will get better at picking up details, like groove and technique over time, so just learn the songs as good as you can and then move one to the next. Try and make it through a 1000 songs over the next few years. You don\u2019t need to remember them, just get through them and move on. You will pretty quickly start recognising patterns in music and realise most music is made up of the same few combinations of chords notes and so on. At this point I would recognise learning some theory, so that you will be able to name those musical patterns be it cadences, notes, chords, extensions and so on.  Then depending on what with your playing. This next bit is super important. If you don\u2019t care about playing in bands or performing for people then you can do this whole thing by your self. But if you want to play with real people on a stage or a basement then you need to spend time playing with people as much as you can. Learn some songs go to a jam session either at a local pub, church or what ever you have in your city. Having friends who play is also great as you might be able to get a chance to play with them regularly, maby even make a band. When learning a song, make sure you can play it all the way through with either a metronome or a drum track before moving on. Video taping also helps to be able to get an objective look/listen to your playing so you will know, what you need to be mindful of. \n\nKeith Jarrett the pianist learned one 1000 songs the first year for a restaurant piano gig before he was known or good.",

    "question": "maybe not a newb question but I thought it was really interesting what Jon said in regards to distortion of converters. I noticed something similar by experimenting with different clocks on my rather cheap interface. \nOne being the internal clock and the other a high quality Antelope Isochrone clock. The minute I hooked it up I was able to monitor a lot louder without it having the feeling of hurting my ears- the increase in clarity was immediate. \nSo It seems to be the case that this subtle (intermodulation?) distortion literally hurts our ears and can make people go deaf. 40 of Drake was saying something similar, so I'm wondering if there's more to this.",

The verb may already be de-correlating the L/R channels (making them different from each other) in the optimal amount.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that different frequencies will likely have different amounts of phase rotation from the dry input signal, so flipping the polarity on one channel (left or right) might cause some frequencies to nullify and some to be accentuated. I wouldn't worry about trying to predict these relationships. It's all a mess by design. Use your ears and see what sounds good.",

        "content": "thanks! @Slow Hand & @oaklandmatt. \n\nSomething i've been noticing a lot lately is, when playing with width effects, i keep preferring, sticking to only one type of widening at a time, instead of combining. To me it achieves the \"clearest\" or most intentional result. For example, for some cool widening on guitar i could use a pingpong slap where one side is phase-flipped. It sounds huge and great, now let's say i also want to chorus it. For some reason it seems to loose some of the width or wow effect of the original widening technique. So i'll usually try a few different effect and see which one i prefer, and 9/10 it always achieves my preferred effect picking one, even tho i like the idea of combining, different techniques to sound \"unique\". The Diminishing returns seem to work against the sound i like in my earholes. I've noticed in a lot of sessions i've been given or been in, a lot of people seem to love adding a bajillion subtle widening things on their lead vocals and when ever i just choose one and turn it up, people usually ask what crazy voodoo i'm doing. \n\nThis is all in the context of widening a mono or less wide sound.",

So if you turn one of them WAY louder than the other, even if they're phasing out, it will be way less obvious. If the frequencies (usually the low end) that are fighting phase wise are the exact same volume, it will be super obvious that htey are phasing out.",

Aliasing is caused by non linear processes like distortion, and dynamics processing (compressor or limiter). Lots online about what it is and why it happens but you can sum it up by saying it\u2019s an inharmonic, digital sounding hash that can feel bright but in a kind of ugly way (but remember sometimes ugly is good)\n- **Higher sample rates reduce the impact of Anti Imaging and Anti Aliasing filters in AD to DA converters.** Filtering is necessary for accurate capture and replay of analog signals, and it in the early days of digital it used to be a real challenge. Now it\u2019s basically a solved problem, but if you are doing acoustic music, with delicate transient information there is still a small but real advantage to higher rates\n- **Higher sample rates reduce overshoot and inter sample peaks on limiters.** This really only matters if you are sending your loud mixes directly to release, otherwise your mastering girl or guy should handle that",

I know that is confounding, but digital and information theory is basically miraculous\n- **We can hear/feel/sense sounds above 20k.** We truly really cannot and if you experiment with significant energy above 20k you\u2019ll actually see problems creep in for electronics and speakers etc. Information above 20k is not our friend (space for harmonic information to live without aliasing back excepted)\n- **Working at multiples of 44.1k is better because the sample rate conversion will work better.** This used to be a little bit true a long time ago but hasn\u2019t been for a long time. Use the SRC in iZotope RX on it\u2019s stock preset to 44.1 and you are in pretty good shape\n- **Digital EQs work better at higher sample rates because of cramping.** Cramping was an esoteric problem with older digital EQs that looked bad on analyzers but never actually sounded very bad. It\u2019s a solved problem nowadays with most EQs.\n- **Video and film is at 48k so we must start there.** Yes film and TV still work at 48k (although YouTube specs 44.1 now) but I have sent a million tracks for sync at 44.1 and it gets dropped in with SRC and away we go",

    "question": "I don\u2019t disagree with you, it\u2019s definitely a common workflow in rnb hip hop and it\u2019s how it\u2019s done more often than not. But even then, rappers write verses with pen and rnb writers can sing on their own to write a song. The way I\u2019ve been going about it is I ask if they have any lyrics at least- with people I have encountered the answer is almost always no. So as a producer, I don\u2019t really have any context to work with. And I\u2019ve tried- many times they end up really disconnected contextually even though they may sound right. \n\nIf they are putting out a lot of volume that they just prefer to get halfway there then it\u2019s a different story, but new artists with no music out yet or a few singles or one EP out having no lyrics or song on them is why I feel the way I do about \u201csend me a beat\u201d situation.\n\nMy perspective may not be as informed because haven\u2019t gotten to work with a good rapper yet. Some of the people that I have tried to work with that insist on this approach don\u2019t know how to work with fitting words into a bar unless they have drums.\n\nSame with RnB- I like to work with keys or guitar in the room and build together from ground up. But my experience has often been people just don\u2019t know what they want or don\u2019t know how to write on their own. \n\nMy frustration is- \u201ccan you at least tell me what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d. Whatever works, works. But if they don\u2019t have any thematic vision then I can barely see it working out \ud83d\ude26",

I don't see why it matters who is footing the bill. makes sense with production and points discrepancies, but mixing? huh?",

But that's on an ideal day for me - more often it's just getting excited about something I heard, getting an idea, and playing around with the mix a lot.  I'm pretty early on in the journey with mixing relatively but realized I was getting burned out already if I didn't continue experimenting and playing around with a song the way I did when I first got interested in this in the first place.  Usually trying new things on every single mix because I have the luxury of usually not being up against the clock working on indie releases.",

I think Prophet 5 wins out on raw tone from the oscillators, but the 6 is 90% of that flavor with a much more modern filter.  They added vintage mode a couple years back which really helped it step even closer to the Prophet 5/10, and the modern features like the Arp, Sequencer, and on board effects as well as that very sick analog distortion circuit make it a lot more versatile for sound design (within the Prophet tonescape obviously).\n\nI'm still in the honeymoon phase with mine but I'm glad I went with a P6 personally.  A lot more viable as a performance instrument and it can also get very very very close to the P5/P10 sounds if you keep it dry and keep the filter closed a bit more.\n\nThe only thing the P6 doesn't do that the P5/P10 can that I wish it could is the way it does voice allocation in non-unison modes - I believe it always steps through round-robin with voices, whereas the P5/P10 retriggers the same voice for the same key until you move away from that key.  Not a huge deal since you can use Unison 1 voice for basses if you want to retrigger the same voice each time.",

I like how the unison sounds on it, and OB6 uses SVF (state variable filter) and it\u2019s gives this thin, but thick texture. Both prophet 6 and ob 6 have very distinctive/recognizable sound. \n\n(funny coming from a guy who has NO hardware synth- but I\u2019ve messed with a few of them! + I was a HUGE synth nerd)",

They were in fact so passionate about music that even when the artist thing started to fizzle they found a way to stay involved\u2026 that kind of love and dedication to a craft usually leads to a certain level of talent. Cian\u2019s not just a fader jockey, he\u2019s also a great drummer. Matt Rad was in punk bands. Noah has played for 10\u2019s of thousands of people at a time.

Update: I was able to successfully download protools intro after several days of not being able to for some reason. During the interim, when I was waiting for avid to be nice to me, I figured out how to 1. Make the grid in Reaper line up with the click tracks that I imported from Audacity - Halleluia. OMG. I have been trying to do that forever. 2. Slip Edit in Reaper and Cubase 3. Use Stretch Markers in Reaper and nudge around little pockets of sound. Now, I have a TRUE and UNIQUE disdain for Reaper. I think it's unintuitive, I think it's cumbersome, I shudder to think of all the time I spent fiddling around with this Nerd-god of a fucking daw when I could've been soaring along in Cubase or Protools, and I'm honestly so, soo sick of it, but... as I'm sitting here with my Dell Lattiude laptop from 2013 with its 8 gigs of ram, trying to install Pro Tools Intro for the 5th time (wheel spinning for minutes on end and then just spontaneously shutting down), I'm thinking to myself, \"Is there any reason I shouldn't just dig my heels into Reaper and finish up this one album with it??\" There are some things I like about Reaper, and the fact that I now preeeetty much know what I need to in order to finish things out, I mean... I've got some serious technological limitations over here. Pro tools intro took 3 hours to download and I'm not even able to install it on my computer. Reaper runs fine (so does Cubase LE4)... I hate it, but I mean... This is where I'm at... Thank you, All.",

I'd love to hear, on a very basic level, how you all approach using the plugin and if there are any starting points that you would recommend. Also curious how this might change in different use cases (i.e. mastering, mix bus, drum bus). Are you simply sliding down the \"clip\" fader until you reduce the peaks a little and then making up gain with another plugin? Are you touching the other 3 faders at all? Do you find yourself frequently auditioning and changing modes and oversampling amounts or sticking to consistent setting. Thanks!",

I have a question about recording guitars: I have a bunch of songs that fluctuate a lot dynamically. Live, I use three or four clean boosts to drive my amp into different levels of distortion (jcm 800). The last time I did a record, I just did it as though i was playing live - just hitting the boosts along with the click when the song went into the different sections. It worked fine, but I've had many working engineers tell me that's NOT the way to do it. Rather, I should have recorded each section that has a different level of distortion/ intensity on its own, so that way I can have more control over the mix and end up with cleaner transitions, potentially... I'm just curious how people here may have handled such a thing. Not that it's important, probably, but I'll add that I don't use any volume or tone controls on my guitars - just humbucker straight to jack. I control all the dynamics with my pedals and strumming hand. Thanks.",

What\u2019s good ?\nSo I\u2019m trying to solve this basic but yet important topic.\nI\u2019ve read here on the discord that a higher sample rate will ensure less aliasing and digital eqs will work better, also that I should be symmetrical with the buffer size (let\u2019s say I use 128 and 48k). \nMy questions here are\n1- If I want to upload music to spotify ( which I guess it converts it all to 44.1k ) should I still use a higher sample rate ?\n2- What buffer size and sample rate would stick to for recording ? And for mixing ? (Music only)\nThank you! Have a good day!",

The only problem is that guitar center is being assholes and really dragging their feet and whatever I can understand why. Is there some other third party I can go through? Some \"phone-in assessor\" or something?? All I need is a signature of an official business. My signature doesn't count because I'm not an \"official business\" - Guitar Centers would count because they essentially act as a pawn shop assessing the value of gear and buying it in etc. etc. Even if there were another insurance company I could go through for just this gear thing I would be open to that.",

My first real big break came from helping out with and swapping songs with a college buddy, who then managed to get a record deal, and I got to come up and help a little bit and meet with their producer. After a brief stint in Australia in another band, like Matt Rad, I relentlessly (but respectfully) kept reaching out to the producer to see if there was any toilets I could clean or any help at all I could give him, or even if he was just available for a quick lunch and could I play him some bands I was working on.  After a couple months he brought me in and taught me melodyne saying \u201cif you get good at this you\u2019re going to own a house someday\u201d. \n\nThis post is coming from inside the house. \n\nI think the mistake a lot of people make is they reach out hoping that someone can help them, and not with the intent of how they can help the person they\u2019re reaching out to. I never planned to be Vocal Producer to the Stars \u2122\ufe0f but it turned out it was a job that needed to be done that other people didn\u2019t want to do, and I started to get passed from big name producer to bigger name producer, and then I got enough clout to actually be the middle sized name producer.

    "question": "My take, after listening, was that a ME should have no problem working on the non limited mix. I heard the clipping but it wasn\u2019t ugly. There are lots of things that go into making a record, and a little clipping here and there isn\u2019t gonna be the difference in a song hitting or not. \n\nBut also- allowing yourself to be curious without being fearful... Taking someone\u2019s note and asking, without judgment, if there\u2019s something you might\u2019ve missed, is worthwhile.\n\nDeeper still, and I\u2019m still working this out: taking the blame and taking the credit are the same thing, I think. Admitting you were wrong can be a sort of superpower, and all the sting and shame disappear and all you\u2019re left with is the learning and growing and relationship building. Walls go down on all sides and it becomes a team effort again. \n\nIt\u2019s real easy to let ego ruin a good feeling. Being able to say \u201cshit what did I miss?\u201d is wayyyy easier than saying \u201cbut I already said it was good so i can\u2019t go back on it\u2026\u201d it takes longer to get there sometimes, but in the end it\u2019s the path of least resistance. \n\nBBQ Sauce.",

    "question": "From my side -- this gets down to \"what is mastering even for?\" territory -- but to the question at hand, it completely depends. As it must. Every project and song is different. Even on the same project, from the same mixer, it can vary widely. Mixers differ in how they deliver as well.\n\nMy opinon is mixers should take the song as far as they can, get it as close to finished as possible, this is better for the music to me. Don't even think about mastering. Then any great ME can add more x/y/z as they hear it (not always level, mastering is also about restraint). \n\nIf you can be concerned with making the music the most itself and singular as possible, really listening for the song, you are doing the right thing. Maybe it needs to be loud, maybe not. Often it seems to me there is a misplaced focus on continuity, or a comparison to a reference, which leads me to ask...are we listening for the music anymore? Or some target that is not what we've actually made?\n\nJust listen for what's there, and do absolutely everything you know how to do to help that. Any competent ME can take it from there, however you prefer to deliver",

Certainly not enough to quantify things like \u201chow much louder will I make your track.\u201d\n\nBest thing I did along the way was develop relationships with MEs. Usually one at a time, and worked through my questions in real time. Figured out what happened when masters come back and i felt amazing vs when they come back and I felt just ok. \n\nOver time I\u2019ve developed a philosophy for myself, (and while that changes/evolves over time,) I\u2019m now confident when I send a mix to master that what I\u2019ll get back will be a more finished  version of my ideas.

Lots of good insight from people here and some amazing trails for you to follow. I'm excited for you!",

Knowing Noire a bit I imagine it might be that real rolled off kinda vibe. When I\u2019ve mixed stuff like that, I do a combo of aggressively attenuating the boominess, and using Spectre/Neutron exciter/Saturn to get as much life out of the midrange as I can before things start getting crunchy or harsh. Then you gotta also just remember that it was the sound they chose and you need to respect that. So it\u2019s a balance.",

It seems to me that if I cant build momentum working full time on music for ~6 months, its not happening, and I really have no free time w my current job + study situation\n\n-is working music jobs good for momentum, or does it hinder you? Im talking doing bar cover gigs for money/making content while building skills during the day\n\n-how is it living w roommates as a musician? Want to get out of my folks\u2019s somewhat soon, and trying to figure out the logistics of needing to practice or record every day",

Haven\u2019t seen you around these parts yet so I don\u2019t know your situation and can\u2019t speak to your specifics. But, there are some overarching philosophical ideas worth considering. \n\n1) the answer to each of these questions is different for every person. None of us got into music because we\u2019re risk averse and looking for stability, so dont think just cause you\u2019re \u201cgoing full time\u201d or you start calling it a \u201ccareer\u201d that somehow that will be different. \n\n2) and this is universally true, you\u2019ll never be younger or have fewer responsibilities than you do now.\n\n3) don\u2019t take the leap if you\u2019re not willing to: be poor. Have roommates. Eat ramen. Breakup with girlfriends/boyfriends who expect more from you. Borrow money for your cellphone bill. Drive a shitty car.

    "question": "Here goes\u2026\nMillion ways to skin this cat. I\u2019ll give you food for thought.\n\n1. At least double track. My personal goal, is to get the sound to be as awesome and huge and perfect with 1 pair of guitar tracks doubled, with 1 mic on an amp. That\u2019s the ideal scenario for me. That said There are people that sum 4 mics down to 1 signal on a mixer and it sounds amazing.  \n\n2. The more performances  you add of the same part, the more blurry it will sound.if you need different textures, consider recording a DI so it can be blended in with your amp in any manner of your choice, either reamping, distorting with a plugin, whatever. (Check phase)\n\n3. I like when the left and right are *subtly* different, no drastically different. You hear \u201cthe left and right being different is what makes something wide\u201d\nThis is true. But I loathe when it\u2019s so different it feels lopsided.\n\nHow do we address this? \n\n-double track using the same guitar so the tuning and intonation is most similar \n\n-change the amp head but keep the same cabinet/speaker so the overall EQ is similar but my the gain structure is different\n\nIf you use 2 different guitars, consider the scale lengths. This will change subtle intonation things, for better or worse.",

I found that if the snare sounds the same in the OH's and rooms as it does in the close mic, it ends up sounding smaller bc of phase or lack of variety.\n\nif you're using 16 drum channels and 8 of them sound the same, what's the point?\n\nThe OH's and rooms for me with that many microphones, i am trying to get width or energy. so the differences between the left and right is what makes it sound big and immersive, and let's the snare mics be their own thing dead center. \n\nNow, if I am doing a 1-5 mic setup, I will concern myself more with all of that stuff and try to get the snare to sound really great and centered.",

Everything on headphones is going to sound clear and direct, when that may not be the case coming through speakers. Checking stuff on some decent monitors in a decent room -- or even in your car --  is always the best way to know if things sound off or not. If you're stuck with headphones, something open back like a Sennheiser 600 will give you a less-hyped, more honest picture of your mix. They're also much less fatiguing to work on for long periods of time! But even to this day with my nice setup, I'm always checking the low end in different places... In my car, I'll know within 10 seconds of listening if things are where they're supposed to be or not.",

Usually they can only be recorded as audio by plugging them into your audio interface and recording the audio as you perform it. I see that this one has a *MIDI In/Out*. That means it can probably receive *tempo* information (so that it synchronizes with other programs) and maybe some *program changes* that can tell it when to change presets.",

I agree with others that not using any unison pre will make the noise floor lower, but I disagree with them in that I think using the unison pres is a pretty good idea often. \n\nThat said, if you\u2019re struggling with noise, definitely try not compressing on the way in because compressors are only going to raise the noise floor. \n\nOn dynamic mics and ribbon mics, you can decrease your noise floor pretty considerably by picking up a cloudlifter and throwing that in the chain. \n\nIf you do all of the above and still have a high noise floor then either the Apollo is broken (which is pretty unlikely), or your microphone is picking up mechanical noise from your air conditioning, computer fan, refrigerator, etc. if those are the issue, then tackle the issue there.

    "question": "So not quite a music question but ive been editing twitch vods and they are super quiet since I have to upload to YouTube. I can push the clip gain in the video software all the way up and not clip before I bring it into protools for final limiting. I still end up around -20 LUFS before limiting which means I need about 6 LUFS to bring it to YouTube 's -14 standard. So my question is what strategies with gain staging etc would you recommend so that im not having the limiter clamp too much when I go to do final export?",

        "content": "I'll gate everything with the Pro-G. Usually as tight as I can while sometimes automating threshhold to make sure ghostnotes don't get lost. I'll peel back the ratio once I have everything triggering properly to let some bleed in to taste. Sometimes I'll only gate 2-3 dB to just get something to pop. Sometimes its in a vaccum.\nI will very rarely compress individual drum mics. And I pray that the recording engineer didn\u2019t either. I like most of my compression to come from the busses. It sounds more natural to my ear and allows you to get away with a more compressed, exciting sound than just whacking the close mics. I\u2019ll find at the beginning my drum mixes will be very \u2018pokey\u2019 \u2014 I want each drum to sound explosive and over the top. That way when i start compressing them, they maintain their transient quality when they start getting dynamically reduced.\n\nI\u2019m always cutting tons of 250-350 out of the kick drums and trying to manufacture any attack with saturation instead of EQ. Having a SansAmp or a Saturn plugin adding high end always sounds more natural to me than just additive EQ. I\u2019m always very wary of the 2-5khz region, and find even-order harmonics are the best bet to fill in the blanks there.\n\nI tend to like my snare drums warm, so often low-shelving down the super low end and keeping the 150-300 \u2018boosh\u2019 intact. I try to avoid using HPF on drum mics because at this point, things should be relatively in phase, so if I put a filter on, it\u2019s going to throw the whole kaboodle off whack. Shelves are your friend here. And same as with the kick drums re: adding high end \u2014 I\u2019m wary off adding the snap in the 2-5khz range, I\u2019ll try and have the body of the snare drum really singing so I only have to add a little bit of top end, often above 5khz just for some air.",

Having this perspective is massively useful in mixing other peoples tracks, because I feel I have a north star of what good drums can sound like if they\u2019re recorded and performed properly. It used to be that my starting point for mixing drums were working with tracks that I had recorded myself\u2026 and most of the above problems were solved before the mix stage. These days, with smaller budgets and time constraints, its very rare that this is a possibility.\n\nI\u2019m including this drum tracking session from a few years ago that I recorded at Barefoot. It was for a project that Matt was producing that never saw the light of day. But we went all out with the drum setup in the big room, through the console, and had a great drummer. This might be useful for some people who have never gotten properly recorded drum tracks\u2026 to get a sense of how good thigns can sound before the \u2018mix\u2019 stage. These are the tracks that were printed into Pro Tools off of the console, and the three busses were prints of the outboard compressor busses we were using while monitoring. It\u2019s unlikely these busses would get used in mixing, but they\u2019re a good reference to what we were listening to in the room while we were tracking. But as you\u2019ll notice, the individual drum blend can stand on it\u2019s own two feet. Hopefully this is useful as well.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

Critical of  Greg Wells pandering to whatever his base is. But recommending a 4k converter based on 'audible conversion quality' isn't helpful if the consumer doesn't have a million other ducks in a row first -- room treatment, adequate monitoring, proper gainstaging, etc. Jon has that figured out, so it makes sense for him. But when people come into a forum with questionable knowledge and background in music production asking what's the best converter, I think it's fair to ask some prying questions before just making blanket recommendations on what one person heard or not. I have plenty of semi-OK stuff that still gets used on the regular, and plenty of expensive gear that I would happily toss out of my workflow. They're all just tools. And whether its bougie DW Fearn or a black-friday Acustica plugin, , if it works for your workflow and gets you results you're happy with, then its worth whatever money you're willing to pay for it.",

Like Jon says often, it's usually about turning things down to gain headroom, and then making it up with low end boosts or high cuts.

In this sense, I think he's listening closely to the effect that a cut has on every other instrument in a mix - not just the instrument he's subtracting from.",

I don\u2019t do it all the time but sometimes it can really help to clear a few mixes that seem a bit finicky ( if you\u2019re looking to speed up your overall turnover). I\u2019m sure others have said it, but taking an ear break from one mix to prep your next , and maybe work on a specific technical issue in another (clip gaining esses for example ) ...can just help me not get bogged down and always moving through the to do list",

In this scenario with the mixbus would it be that the OD files would be off by the exact amount of dly samples shown at the bottom of the mixbus track with the inserts on it or would it be that pro tools has compensated some but not all and that's why it's off? I mean I've had days where I'll print through the same chain back into pro tools on a mixdown track and it won't line up the same as the day before which just makes me question what the feckkk is going on with delay compensation in pro tools..?\n\nSide note I've found it helpful to keep a duplicate 'submaster' / mixbus channel with zero inserts on it for use when tracking / OD. I'll flip back and forth for monitoring when need be.",

    "question": "This has been on my mind lately, so I just figured I should run it across: I was being mentored (mixing) by this guy who I respect tremendously. He was always telling me that I need to replace my plugins (have been using free plugins for the longest) and suggested that I start with Waves and some of the UAD offerings. So, I went ahead and downloaded all the Waves counterparts (UAD wouldn't work on my computer for some reason) to my stable of free plugins and did a mix that way. At first I really liked it, but then the sound of the Waves stuff began to wear on me for some reason. That's the only way I can describe it - The sound started to wear on me. So, now I'm back to using my free plugins and liking mixing again. All that to say: Is there any reason I shouldn't use free plugins?? I have zero knowledge of what's going on \"under the hood\" of all this stuff. Zero technological prowess in that regard whatsoever. The only way i know how to tell if something is \"better\" than the other is by feeling, I suppose. So, yeah. And all these paid plugins, I mean... it's a lot of money. Thanks, ya'll.",

For a guy like me, this opens up a whole world of possibilities. I immediately want to know what \"this crossfade sounds like and what this cross fade sounds like and what this does to this part and blah, blah, blah...\" Like, there's too much shit to learn - too many parameters.

Much less experienced than everyone on here, but the one metric I keep coming back to is: Do I respond to it emotionally - The track that is... If the performance is flawless and the mix is hitting all the specs on the nerd meter, but i'm not responding to it emotionally, then, I mean... I dunno. Currently trying to reconcile this emotional response that I consider so paramount with the fact that things aren't quite where I want them to be sonically. Sometimes, I think you just have to find the right plugins that will enable you to move closer to what you want sonically without fucking with the flow. Kind of a catch 22 at times. Regarding the plugin thing being good on the stock setting: I read somewhere a while back that most plugin makers put the stock setting as stock because that's where they thought the plugin sounded best. I sometimes feel like if I use a stock setting that I'm cheating as a mixer, but am I even a mixer?? Lol. I'm just a musician fiddling with knobs.",

I layed down what I thought were going to be scratch vocals, guitars and bass to a click a while back - I thought I was just going to discard these and lay the drums over top and come back and do everything again like I've done a million times before when working with other people. Once I finished the drums (which took a while) I tried to come in lay the bass and it was just NOT WORKING. I don't know why exactly, but I was just not syncing up. Tried it with the click without the click, neither worked... For some reason, when I'm doing all the parts on my own, i have to build things backwards - starting with the click, then guitar, vox, bass and drums last, otherwise things won't sync up. A lot of the time I spent on drums was simply writing the parts, so now that that is out of the way, tracking them again should go much more quickly. The End.",

I recently got their stereo ribbon as a R88 wasn't quite in budget and it never disappoints. 550\u20ac vs 2800\u20ac here in Germany. The R88 might sound better, but 5x better? At that point, \"not so great\" build quality and/or quality control is to be expected and okay (in my mind).\n\nGenerally speaking: mid tier-priced stuff is the most disappointing, in my experience. Most of the time, \"buy nice or buy twice\" rings true when the price difference is around 2x. But 5 stereo ribbons for the price of 1? That's how you do Atmos right, baby",

I first thought it was the car I was in, but then I switched vehicles and it's happening in that car, too. It's only that one station, but yeah - all the music that comes through sounds like it's put through some type of flanging effect and is also much lower volume-wise. It's only that one station. Been that way for about a week now. I vaguely remember something like this happening a while back. Anyway, just wanted to see if anyone here has experienced anything similar in their area. Thanks.",

So he does more subtle moves to bring out the best in each mix. If you're recording stuff yourself, you will likely want to add a lot of compression to get the same modern, perceived loudness.\n\nThe fundamental thing to know is that \"compression\" simply means \"reducing the dynamic range\" (aka \"compressing\" the range of volume of your sound ). This can be achieved with \"compressors\" as well as \"limiters,\" \"saturators,\" \"clippers,\" \"distortion,\" and a number of other types of effects that do it in different ways (and may add other sonic characteristics to your sound).",

Maybe try having a timed delay on one of your drum signals you can play off of. like a 1/16 note or triplet echo very faintly that, when you're in the pocket, grooves with your drumming. might be tough if you're doing really busy proggy stuff or if you're really worried about timing from an OCD perspective.\n\n3. if you have scratch guitar/bass tracks that were tracked to a click/perfectly gridded drum thing, playing along to that is usually far more inspiring and you can rely less on the click because you can just listen to the instruments.\n\n4. This is where having someone else record you helps. you might be totally in your head about this. a \"producer\" could be like \"bro that take was legit perfect\"",

    "question": "1) a strong work ethic: You have to be willing to put in the time and energy into the project. You will always be the first person there and the last to leave. Once you accept this and work it into your life, it just becomes the way it is!\n\n2) a good personality: You need to be good around people. Half of this job is psychological. You have to know when to speak up as well as when to not say anything. Talkback etiquette is crucial. Learn to read people. Never get angry or passive aggressive. You always need to be voice of reason. People have to trust you.\n\n3) a solid skill-set: You have to always know what your doing and be confident in your abilities. Know the technical side of things. You should also be musically inclined. Be curious! Why does a song sound a certain way? How did they do it? If you don't care and don't want to know \u2013 you should do something else.\n\n4) actual follow through: You'd be surprised how many flaky people work in this business. If you're a guy that does things when you say you'll do them and answers phonecalls/emails in a timely manner, then you're already leagues above most other people.\n\n5) the ability to network with people and capitalize on your relationships is the only way to move forward in this business. Going to shows, parties, events, etc. You never know where work is going to come from.\n\nYour work gets you work. Make sure everything you do is the best representation of your abilities. Don't choose which projects to care more about. Give it your all on everything... even if its a shitty gig. That word will spread and you'll start getting more work through that.\n\nHope this helpful. Good luck!",

Over the last 7 years of engineering in studios of all kinds on a wide variety of projects, I've built up a bunch of recall notes + photos / tips that I picked up, all gathered in Evernote. Some of them will be audible in commerical recordings. I've wanted to formalise them to share in some way for a while, so I'm wondering if the people here can suggest the most useful and accessible way to do that.\n\nIn a perfect world I'd do YouTube videos for them all, but I just don't have time to commit to that. A reasonable tradeoff might be to build out a reference section on my website (what I've been calling... The Cookbook), and leave it there for ever more for people to pilfer from.\n\nWhat say ye?",

    "question": "What are you doing for chords? A common pitfall of static arrangements is getting locked into the same four bar chord loop. Sometimes you've got to break out of that. Start there, even if it's as simple as telling a different story with your chords over eight bars versus four bars.\n\nPlay with the harmonic rhythm of your chord changes. Some very basic examples:\n1. Instead of a single chord every measure, alternate between one chord per measure and two chords per measure.\n2. Hold on a single chord for six measures and then do a cadence with a quick succession of chords on bars seven and eight.\n3. Take your progression and play it at half the speed (a four bar progression becomes an eight bar progression).\n\nI know you said you're just making beats right now, but chords or a melody are going to inform and motivate your \"players\" and show them what to do. There needs to be some \"meat\" to the song for them to react to. If you don't like the melody you can mute it later. But give your \"players\" something to react to.",

It will give your record propulsion, confidence and purpose instead of dropping the listener into the middle.)\nEnd the record in a conclusive and unmistakable way.\n\nEverybody plays as soft as they can.\nEverybody plays as loud as they can.\nThe louder you play the simpler the part has to be.\nThe softer you play the faster the part has to be.\n\nRole play.

On very rare occasions if I knew there was going to be a huge dynamic shift I\u2019d reach out and grab the output fader, but I can probably count on one hand how many times I\u2019ve had to do that.\n\nWe were fairly conservative on the 1176 on the way in, largely cause you can\u2019t un crunch a vocal that\u2019s been over compressed, but once the vocal was in PT it would be hit by just irresponsible levels of compression and limiting. Like goes against how virtually every \u201cexpert\u201d online would tell you how to do it. Most people would tell you the solo\u2019d tracks would sound bad, but as part of the song their impact is objectively unarguable",

While I really liked the sound of the mix as is,  I also have reason to trust my ears the least (inexperience). The clipping data made me realize that there could be something I'm missing by going with this one. If I wind up hating the change I'll just go back to using the initial one despite the clipping data. That way I at least see what the alternative winds up being. This ME did mention that he was willing to work on the mix as is, but how he framed it leads me to believe it might not be a good fit if I go with that version.  I definitely Trust Noah's ear though, and his messages give me the reassurance to walk if need be. If I need to walk, I also now know who to hit up to use that initial version.",

        "content": "Of course depends on the tempo, part, sound of the drums, aesthetic of the track - but a few things that have worked in different scenarios for me:\n\nCreate the impression of some distance to walls by sending snare (start there, maybe add other mics) to a short stereo delay. Often something like 90ms on one side, 120ms on the other. Feel it out on one side, then add some time to the other.\n\nTry adding some fake distance to your existing room mics with a simple delay with no feedback (there\u2019s a Steve Albini drum video on YouTube where he demonstrates this). You can delay both sides equally, or solo one side, delay it til it feels good/sounds cool, then do the other. Anything from 12ms-around 23 seems to work. From there things start to become more like a slap, but than can be cool too.\n\nSmash up your existing rooms a bit, or a lot. Omnipressor, Devil Loc, UAD Zener, decapitator, Rough Rider (free), Arousor/Distressor in nuke, Lo-Fi. \n\nSend to a gated verb - Cian shared a drum session a while back with a short VintageVerb preset that\u2019s often useful. RMX16 Non-Lins can be good too, although it\u2019s easy to bring things into 80s territory this way.\n\nSend to a short room verb like ocean way, SP2016, Pro-R, Valhalla Room, Raum. Sometimes from close mics, sometimes from overheads, sometimes just slapping it straight on room mics. A little distortion (Decapitator, Devil Loc) after is often helpful.\n\nWith all of these solutions, the thing that seems to help them gel with the rest of the real kit is drum bus processing - compression and/or saturation.",

I have found, however, that if I don't have the snare exactly the same distance from the overheads, that I can distinctly hear the snare pulling to one side or the other - no matter how much I high pass - and this bothers me.

    "question": "I send shit out of the box all the time, because it\u2019s more fun for me, I\u2019ll send drums out to guitar pedals to get fun sounds, like the EHX bass micro synth does some weird shit to drums.\n\nThe second conversion isn\u2019t a problem IMO, to me you leave the box because you can\u2019t get the sound or you\u2019ll be more inspired to get a different sound because you have your hands on the knobs and can turn two at one time which you can\u2019t really do with a mouse. \n\nThat\u2019s why I still send things out to my distressor or my LCA2B(tubes) , maybe try it and find a sound you like, then try and hear if you can duplicate the sound you like using one of the saturation plugins in the box, if you can, then no need to send out again, but if you can\u2019t, then you\u2019ll know that you\u2019ll do that thing again. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just more fun to send out to the gear instead of staying in the box?!?",

    "question": "Here\u2019s what I\u2019m experiencing on a project . It\u2019s a musical type album almost like Hamilton that sort of vibe. All the vocals I\u2019m getting for every song is recorded without an outboard mic pre or compressor from a C414 to an audient ID4\u2019s mic input . Prob is even when the tracks are not clipping in levels but they all sound like there\u2019s some small level of clipping going to the AD converters .  And I doubt the vocalists has decent microphone techniques singing in. Seeing that the vocals are supposed to sound kinda warm n not as polished , Even with some EQ moves, the vocals are still sounding like there\u2019s some 3rd harmonic sounding saturation on them.  Anyone experienced this before ? Would love to hear anything that\u2019ll help it sound better . \ud83d\ude05",

My usual go to has been 414ebs one on the high strings and one towards where the lower and middle strings meet, both kinda following the angle of the piano body. This never fails to get a great sound. If you can take the lid off try an aea r88 diagonally across the body one side pointing to the high strings one side pointing towards the low and mids, this has been one of the most natural sounds I\u2019ve EVER gotten from a piano. It just feels so real and right. You can also try some other great stereo mics like the sm69 on cardioid for both caps. Used to stick that in a similar position as the 88 with the lid on the big stick and then blanket the whole thing to fuck. You could get amazing separation even with drums in the room and it still sounded natural. There\u2019s also the humble 57!!! Don\u2019t sleep on those if you\u2019re after a very direct and contained sound you can get a couple of those on it and get exactly what you\u2019re after.",

    "question": "I had a visceral, emotional reaction listening to these tracks. As a die hard EV/barefoot fan, getting to dig into these tracks is probably one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever gotten to do.\n\n@cian riordan , I\u2019ve got some questions if you\u2019re willing to answer or remember:\n\nAre these all UTA pres?\n\nDo you remember what drums you were using?\n\nHow are the room mics (U67s) placed? This, alongside the chamber mics, seriously gave me goosebumps to listen to. \n\nHow are the overheads placed? They seem super wide and right over the cymbals but when you add the snare mic it all sounds perfect. \nIs all the saturation on each channel a product of driving the UTA preamps? I\u2019m amazed at how distorted they are when solo-ed and how much it allows them to punch through.\n\n\nSorry for my gushing, but this is just the coolest thing ever to me.

Most likely Eric\u2019s Sonor birch kick drum with a Remo Black Dot on it. Almost certainly Vistalite toms\u2026 and this sounds like a Bell Brass snare.\n\n3) Room mics are placed probably 20 feet away, spaced wide, pointed at the kit. Eric would always point the room mics away from the drums with the cardioid null towards the drum kit, but I found I got more direct, punchy sounds with it facing the drums. Chamber mics would\u2019ve been a foot apart, pointed 45 degs out\u2026 sort of intentionally phasey to make them wider.\n\n4) Yeah, you\u2019re onto it. The overheads are intentionally wide and close to the cymbals. The mono mic and close mics are doing the heavy lifting with the drums and the L/R OHs are almost just cymbal spot mics with some kit stereo information peppered in.\n\n5) Saturation is a combination of driving the UTA pres, clipping the line input of the console, and trimming things back with the faders. Might\u2019ve been an LA-2a on the snare with no compression, just crapping out the tubes.\n\nSorry wish I woulda taken pictures of this session. Dave Elitch was the drummer and he\u2019s a fucking monster.",

But the different use cases seem pretty obvious too:\n\n\"If you want to attenuate a specific \u201cproblem\u201d frequency or small range of frequencies, a dynamic EQ would be your best bet. The option to have narrower bands allows for this kind of focused attenuation.\n\nConversely, if you\u2019re trying to control larger areas of the frequency spectrum, a multiband compressor works well. Also the non-linear way a compressor attenuates signal can add character to a signal. If you don\u2019t need the surgical control, but want some subtle sonic coloration, a multiband compressor can be a better choice than a dynamic EQ.\"",

That way you can really understand the idea of a threshold, different attack/release combinations, and and compression ratios. Once you can start to understand what you're hearing, then you can apply that to other compressors that might have more fixed variables (LA2a, etc). I've always found overdoing it when you're first getting the settings will help you understand whats going on.",

        "content": "One thing I'd add is the importance of matching your output levels so that the dry sound and the compressed sound are the same volume when you bypass the compression. Many compressors have have automatic volume compensation included and others will require you to adjust the makeup gain that comes after the compression.\n\nThe reason it's important is because when we're comparing the dry signal to the compressed signal, the louder of the two signals will always feel better to us. It's important to match the volume levels when comparing so that we're not fooling ourself into thinking a louder signal is better and we can hear the compression (or most effects) for what really is.",

(This is in a perfect world where the beat is mixed perfectly and has the right amount of space for the vocal). I see this is how a lot of people are running sessions and how they are mixing demos, to either release or send out to mix & master.

They mount when the plug turns on, then Keyboard maestro ejects them a few hours later, and they turn off with HomeKit automation. I was tired of coming down to work and having the drives humming super loud when I walk in. \n\nI want to get another plug for my other Furman that powers my Apollo and monitors. I do turn off the Furman switch instead of individual components. \n\nAll that to say, you should be good to use a smart switch for something like this. I have the WeMo plug currently. The only caution is that it\u2019s often \u201cgood practice\u201d to turn off your monitors before anything else, although modern gear seems a bit better about not popping your monitors!",

I think similar features are implemented in Intel systems depending on how you have your power settings set in the BIOS and OS (at least in Windows).  So counterintuitively if you aren't pushing your cores to the limit they won't be operating as effectively.  When I'm working on the Mac I keep the buffer as low as possible and then tick it up during the mix process, and on Windows my machine is usually really stable at 1024 from start to finish in a mix so I just leave it there, but I've also disabled any sort of power saving stuff on my PC in the BIOS so the clock speeds should be relatively stable.  Again, I'm not sure if this is actually the cause or not but just what I've seen posted about online anecdotally!",

You need a high ratio to get the deeper ducking effect that it seems you're seeking.\n\nUsing a soft ratio will never get you a big duck unless you have the threshold pulled all of the way down.

    "question": "Hey guys, really really newbie question but i am struggling so much that i need to ask. What is gain staging and how can i do it properly ? I know the basics like noise floor, clipping over 0 but there are so many different information out there I just can't tell which is right. Some say you need -6 db of headroom blablabla but i watch Jon Castelli or any other mix engineers mixing they are mixing to 0 and loud af. It feels like im doing something wrong and but i don't know what im doing wrong if that makes any sense. Would love to hear how you guys approach it and would love to learn from you. Thanks.",

        "content": "This is a very broad question with many different answers, but I think the easiest way to sum up the concept of \u2018gain staging\u2019 is simply figuring out what level every \u2018device\u2019 is expecting and/or which level is ideal to get the results you want. These \u2018devices\u2019 can be a plugin, a piece of hardware, an A/D/A converter, an auxiliary bus, a mix bus, etc.\n\nIn analog world\u2026 there might be fathomable difference when a compressor or amplifier receives -10dBVU vs +10 dBVU. Accounting for these differences would be considered gain staging \u2014 and you\u2019d be looking for what gets the ideal sound out of your box.\n\nIn digital world\u2026 some plugins may react similarly and others may not care if you\u2019re sending -6dBFS or -0.01dBFS. It\u2019s usually case by case as there are myriad plugins. You also need to consider what level the plugin is sending signal out \u2014 as this will affect how the next plugin processes the audio, or how much headroom it has to work with. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m sending signal out of a compressor plugin into an EQ plugin \u2014 and lets say I\u2019m using the compressor to beef up mean volume of the signal and then I want to EQ some more low end into the signal after the fact. Well, I\u2019m going to be adding gain in the compressor and then the level going into the EQ will be hotter than originally intended. Id want to trim down the output of the compressor (or the input of the EQ) so you have headroom to be able to boost those frequencies without clipping the output of the EQ. In a 32-bit floating mixer like Pro Tools, these issues become less audible as the mixer has higher headroom than its indicating, but you never actually know \u2014 and it\u2019s best to just stick to the parameters that you have control over. If you were to do this same function with an analog compressor and EQ, there would be very noticeable distortion if you didn\u2019t stage the gain properly.",

        "content": "Sometimes gain staging is just managing the signals going to an auxiliary bus or a master fader. If you\u2019ve got everything summing into - say - an aux bus in pro tools, and that aux bus is clipping, then that will be audible distortion going into the next gain stage. It may sound good, it probably doesn\u2019t \u2014 so its something to account for earlier down the chain. If you\u2019re going into a master fader in pro tools, and your signal is over 0dBFS, you can simply turn down the master fader, and it is actually turning down all the signals going to it, not just the output. This is useful because you can then throttle the input to your first plugin in the chain \u2014 say a limiter or maximizer. It\u2019d be a shame to have a fancy clipper on your master bus, only to be clipping the signal in the chain before even getting to it.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a scattershot answer to a scattershot question, but the reality is that everything affects everything in audio. And having your head wrapped around signals levels going in and out of things will help you make faster decisions and help you troubleshoot quickly when things aren\u2019t sounding quite right.",

    "question": "I wrote in my notes from the Bainz episode that the way each guest/mixer talks about gainstaging the various tracks of a mix, it definitely is the mixer\u2019s version of a \u201cbusiness mission statement,\u201d which @Slow Hand alludes to with the idea of talking about how one choice ripples to inform all of our other decisions. Gainstaging sets the record up to show off its best qualities\u2014and are those qualities in the low end of a booming bass synth and the natural silky quality of the vocalist, or maybe you want the mid range to feel really detailed yet cohesive and warm. \n\nUnderstanding this, for me, made the finishing process that Jon talks about make sense. Level setting inherently overlaps with the kind of decision making process of EQing, which is something you can probably understand best from this clip of Bainz talking about how he can get a vocal to be so upfront in his mixes because he\u2019s surgical in what he keeps in there. The way I understood it, he\u2019s cleaned up the vocal a ton, set the levels of his tracks by what feels important to bring to the forefront for the listener, and then he uses those levels to inform his EQ moves throughout.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CkSeHgrosyx/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=",

(And I do mean *great*)\n\nTo answer your other question, my personal approach usually leads me to making up 2-3db on 2buss processing. So before I instantiate and add any gain from inflators or limiters at the end of my master fader chain, I have 2-3db of headroom. \nStarting with kik snare bass around -6db, adding in vocals and everything else all balanced properly usually gets me to around -2. Which is more than enough for a mastering engineer but not enough to get myself into trouble tryna get to make it loud with my Ozone or whatever. \n\nThat\u2019s just my process currently. No doubt there\u2019s different ways to get there, some likely much better, but this has been working well for my purposes.",

It\u2019s not as easy as lining a kick to the grid as half you guys are using kick samples that have space before the transient.  When I\u2019m out here nudging and stretching vocals at 1/1000th of second resolutions, which can dramatically change the pocket and vibe, it\u2019s a kick in the teeth then if the whole track ends up being a tenth of a second off. \n\nThe trick I came up with was putting four low frequency Square wave bursts maybe an 1/8th note long each at the beginning or end of each song. That means at no matter the master bus processing (or worse the mp3 meta data at the beginning pushing the song back) you can recalibrate EXACTLY the track back on to the grid. In that case, once you\u2019ve figured that bit out, slap whatever you want on the bus. The square wave trick is how we were able to prove how logic or ableton was bouncing out of time even when a ton of people didn\u2019t hear it or notice.",

I ask them to send me the session too as I have Pro Tools, Logic, and Ableton and can play with their processing and do a new bounce if need be.\n\nIf a vocal bounce comes back with some delay uncompensated or otherwise off the grid, lining up the vocal will NOT take you an hour. You simply line up the ref to your session and the vocal to the ref (the latter is 99% of time already done since they're bouncing from the same session). This takes a few minutes max and I've done it dozens of times. Nudge and flip some phase and you're within a couple samples. You're fine.",

    "question": "Hey i have some noob questions pertaining to room treatment. I've read a bunch over on gearspace in the forums, read a bunch of ethan winers stuff on his site, and will be occupying a room roughly 14x14x8. I got 16 manville 408 2x4 panels for absorption awhile back and my aim is to treat the room for mixing. I need a space to be able to accurately hear so that i can learn and train my ears. Someone on the unofficial reaper discord recommended you guys. I am gonna get a reference mic and set it all up with REW, adding/ removing /moving panels around and taking measurements and then comparing the results? I'm looking at safe  ' sound batting material for bass traps and clouds etc. This is all i've gathered and i won't be in the space for a few weeks so i thought I'd start to get my ducks in a row. Please any and all recommendations/resources/advice is appreciated.",

        "content": "The landscape for pitching songs has changed dramatically in the last decade. It still exists, but it has shrunk to the point where even the top level writers can't rely on it as much.\n\nThis is simply because many more people can write songs and make demos quickly. This results in two things: the market is flooded with songs, and artists who used to rely on pitch songs are now writing (or co-writing) the majority of their material.\n\nMany songs that used to be sent to an artist are now brought into the room and finished with the artist themselves. Like, you'd pitch a chorus or a 3/4 finished song to an artist and finish with them on the spot.\n\nThe genres where pitching songs still predominates are country the (industry is still writer\u2013driven), EDM (many artists are performers who do not write or produce), and pop (but they're mostly just looking for HITS).\n\nAnother consequence of this shrinking pitch landscape is that the projects that need \"outside\" songs are much more gate-kept by people in the industry. In country, there are publishers and labels that generally source the songs. In pop, labels and executive producers (of specific projects) tend to be the gate keepers, and in EDM it is a similar combo.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the best way to pitch songs is to build direct relationships with artists or go through the various business people who gate-keep the process.\n\nTo advise you based on your question: make incredible records with your friends, peers, and the people around you, and get visibility that way. Hustle like crazy and use every moment of new visibility as a stepping stone to get in the mix with the larger music community. Ultimately you probably sign a publishing deal and sing with a manager where you get business representatives to help guide you and connect you further.\n\nAs with all things music, if you actually really for real make A+ records, people will find you. It's just that this is a lot harder than people think.",

I\u2019m also a CB/teezio fan and one of the rnb/trap engineers on here , so I\u2019d consider myself pretty familiar with Bainz and teezios general workflows having studied their work a bit myself . I\u2019ve not been in the same room as them as the mods you\u2019ve been speaking to have tho  , and beyond these shows the screen videos \u2026\u2026I believe Matt\u2019s LWMR vids with teezio and Bainz are more insightful with respect to the why , rather than the what \u2026..\nHappy to chat on all this with you , and if necessary help you to feel like you\u2019ve built a voxal chain you\u2019re happy wirh for these genres",

HPF is still an EQ move. Not wholly accurate to conflate the two though they are used synonymously at times. Context dependent. Filter could be describing the shape of the EQ move being made. But if I said hey filter out everything below 100hz vs hey EQ out everything below 100hz - I mean the same thing. Might be a little more nuance to the history of the language used I could be missing; perhaps someone else could fill in. I think volcano has some non-linear harmonic / saturation component to it but I'm not super familiar with that plug.",

In my case I am set up with BMI in the US as my PRO and Publisher and have an admin pub deal with Sentric to collect in territories outside the US.\n\nAlso you'll want to be set up with SoundExchange to collect digital performance royalties (SiriusXM, iHeart, Pandora).  This often also involves the letter of direction that is kicked off with your producer agreement.\n\nI'm probably forgetting something but I'd highly recommend talking with a music lawyer to get things set up and working for you.",

I find low end to be particularly sensitive to phase shifts. Phase shifts blur sound slightly, which is particularly bad for the low end instrument that you want to be punchy and full. \n\nWhile EQ may boost your overall low end, often times you are losing punch and clarity at the same time.",

    "question": "Hey guys, sorry to get on here with this, but: I've just finished tracking drums for an album -10 songs, 16 microphones - I tracked in Reaper, but comping and editing in Reaper is TERRIBLY difficult for me; I generated all my click tracks in Audacity and flew them in Reaper to track along to, but I CANNOT get the grid in Reaper to line up with the \"grid\" that I made in Audacity. I can get everything to line up in Tracktion Waveform (really like that DAW), but Waveform doesn't have \"quantizing.\" Annnd... I think I need to quantize some shit?? - The drums are played really well, but there are just a few areas where I might need to nudge things a bit, perhaps take a fill from take 3 and put it on take one - Just generally nudge some things and do some copy pasting, cross fade etc... Help me. I need a bonehead simple DAW for this. I've been dreading this moment the whole time... I've seen some videos of people doing this type of thing in Stuido One and it looks easy, but I can not find their free version anymore - and I'm not sure it would have the features I need to do this??? Again... Help.",

I generally use AD when I just need to get things moving as fast as possible, and SD when I want to go deeper and am chasing a more specific sound.",

Re eqing in solo vs in context: Typically, I listen to everything going at once, and then if I hear something that bothers me consistently, I'll solo the thing and pull out the freqs - but you know, I should probably start doing it all in context... More in context eqing I think would be good, yeah... I don't know how, but sometimes is it possible that those \"nasty freqs\" can kind of aid things in a way?",

Even though i've learnt and practiced a lot of mixing stuff but my mixes sound still amateur. I'm thinking of upgrading to UAD Apollo for better converters as i've learnt that DA converter does affect what i can hear out of my speakers. Could you guys kindly give me more insight into this issue? Thanks!",

There are a lot of reasons that an Apollo might be a good investment, but buying them for the converters probably isn't the best use of your money at this stage.\n\nThe difference that converters will make (if any) is very very small compared to other factors. Factors like having a good room to listen in, acoustic treatment for the room, and the monitors you're listening through. I would prioritize those and consider converters to be very low priority until you get those other factors working well.\n\nSo unless there are other reasons that you'd like to have an Apollo I think you can save your money for the time being.",

In this case, while I'd focus my attention on getting some reps in on various mixing projects, there's certainly room to grow in your equipment stable. Headphones are a great starting point and will likely continue to be useful down the road, but mixing on speakers helps you make things translate better to the real world (car & home stereos, public spaces, etc). So a pair of decent entry level monitors would be my next purchase. It will also prove useful for collaborating with other folks down the road as you can all hear the same thing from the same source.",

I got rid of MB compression on my mixbus and do earlier . So , I love the character of the SSL comp as a finisher , glue etc . Only problem . I find it impossible sometimes to avoid vocal pumping . Are there any old vet strategies for this ? I\u2019ve tried pinning the vocal on its bus pre 2 bus in an effort to anchor it in the mix , but the dynamics I lose in the vocal by so doing still don\u2019t really seem to earn me much improvement against the pumping of the SSL",

Often something like 90ms on one side, 120ms on the other. Feel it out on one side, then add some time to the other.\n\nTry adding some fake distance to your existing room mics with a simple delay with no feedback (there\u2019s a Steve Albini drum video on YouTube where he demonstrates this). You can delay both sides equally, or solo one side, delay it til it feels good/sounds cool, then do the other. Anything from 12ms-around 23 seems to work. From there things start to become more like a slap, but than can be cool too.\n\nSmash up your existing rooms a bit, or a lot. Omnipressor, Devil Loc, UAD Zener, decapitator, Rough Rider (free), Arousor/Distressor in nuke, Lo-Fi. \n\nSend to a gated verb - Cian shared a drum session a while back with a short VintageVerb preset that\u2019s often useful. RMX16 Non-Lins can be good too, although it\u2019s easy to bring things into 80s territory this way.\n\nSend to a short room verb like ocean way, SP2016, Pro-R, Valhalla Room, Raum. Sometimes from close mics, sometimes from overheads, sometimes just slapping it straight on room mics. A little distortion (Decapitator, Devil Loc) after is often helpful.\n\nWith all of these solutions, the thing that seems to help them gel with the rest of the real kit is drum bus processing - compression and/or saturation.",

They're probably  not coming for outlets. A handyman will be your best bet to offload the work practically if you don't want to do it yourself. Like I said in deleted comments, if you going to do it yourself. Get the electricty detector pen. And check each outlet before starting. Even after turning off the breaker. Just cause the first 4 are off. The fifth might be on the washer and dryer breaker line a floor above. The electricity wont kill ya, but it will zoom ya. Also if renting landlord should be consulted first to see if theyll carry the weight of the task. Considering the state of the 30 plus year old outlets, probably unlikely. Your above question about protect you not the gear, I don't understand that framing? I used the AI to try and save myself from typing this..... alas",

    "question": "Thank you!  One real and simple example is this band repeatedly requested \"guitar up\" \"vocals down\" over and over again and the guy is pretty new to guitar so it was pretty shambolic, which I was trying to hide a little.  The balance was getting ridiculous, to my ears at least, but I just went with it.  \"It's their record, not mine!\"  But then there's part of me that feels responsible for them like I can't let them shoot themselves in the foot.  I thought maybe they're listening in a car and it sounds weird.  Or a phone speaker.  Just some paranoia.  I think I'm struggling a little like \"when do I step in and try to say something and when do I not?\"  This was their first EP of their young lives FYI.   I imagine the more pro bands are not asking you to make crazy revisions.    (and to be clear - the revision notes are mostly great and make the song better)",

    "question": "As purely an instrumentalist at the moment, I'm trying to expand the sounds I can get in my productions with singing (mainly supporting artists with BGVs/vocal pads/doubling etc.).\nMy voice and tone is very weak to support artists in most styles at the moment, so I'll be starting from ground 0 in my practice routine.\nSo far, I've been practicing going up and down scales with a met (half-time and full-time), using different syllables thru the scales, and singing long tones with different syllables.\n\nDoes anyone have sources and or advice for a beginner to strengthen their singing voice?",

Hire a decent vocal coach and do a few vocal lessons (even a single lesson with a great teacher is important). You will get someone to teach you in-person how to breathe properly (that's the power source for the instrument you're learning). ALSO, you'll come away with a recording of a vocal warm up (somewhere between 5-20 minutes usually). YOU WILL THEN:\n\n3. Start EVERY day with vocal warm ups.\n\n4. Do whatever else you want to do that gets you singing a lot. Make it fun. I like learning songs, doing a voice memo every time I sing, and occasionally listening back. I sing bob dylan songs for my girlfriend. I record tons of vocals for songs I'm working on. Etc",

        "content": "I'm going to take a stab but it's a little picky on the terminology and it's long-winded:\n\nUsually working with a mixer is like driving down a one way street in terms of file swapping.  You typically bring in a mixer when your song and production is fully complete, you've made it the best version of itself you could reach on your own but still want to bring in someone with more experience to help you take it to that next level of polish.  So typically in this version of a client/mixer relationship you probably wouldn't ever ask for the multitrack post-edit without some sort of unique circumstance that you'd be communicating with them directly.\n\nIt sounds to me in your other conversations here that in your case, the mixer is really filling a engineering/additional production role in your project.  They are taking files of yours before they can see the entire picture of the song and helping shape the tones, doing the editing, and managing the files for you as you submit more pieces to them over time.  In this type of working relationship files are typically shared in a two way street style.  You both are collaborating and working together toward the finish line.  This role is not something I would call a mixer though - they may still do your final mixes but they are also acting as an engineer or even producer.\n\nI know this is being a little semantic but I think it's important because the context changes how you can describe it as customary or not.\n\nAs always, you'll need to chat directly to them and explain a bit why you want to get those edited multitracks back.  My first assumption sadly if I were in your buddy's shoes is that you weren't happy with the work and wanted to send those files to someone else.  So if that's the case, let them know early, and if that's not the case, let them know why you want the files.",

For artists you're just meeting, it may be a tough sell, and perhaps you're better off looking for the ones who already know the value of a mix. Those people are looking for what you offer.\n\nBut I'm not the person who should be giving this advice, and I'm the absolute worst at putting it into practice, so take it with a grain of salt.",

    "question": "After spending years studying from afar, I buckled down and started mixing at the end of last year. LWMR really helped everything click for me. I used to be an artist, so I have years and years of recording experience, and doing rough mixes for myself and the homies, but I\u2019m very new to this side of things. I was lurking around on here and I see that it\u2019s common when starting out that doing free mixes can easily turn into doing much more. I only have 2 real \u201cclients\u201d right now but I\u2019m mixing, producing, writing, recording\u2026 I love it, don\u2019t get me wrong. The more I can help, the better. I guess I\u2019m just having trouble navigating this space. Going deep with these 2 artists, I\u2019m having a hard time building a portfolio, which is messing with my confidence. Specially with mixing. I can get thumbs up from the people I\u2019m working with, my mentor (my old engineer), but without audience interaction I don\u2019t know what to do with that. I\u2019d like to take on more work, but I only have 1 mix out. Hopefully an EP a couple more mixes by the end of next month. I feel weird shopping myself with no portfolio, free work or not. I don\u2019t know where I stand, where to focus my energy and everything just feels like it\u2019s on slow-drip. Any advice?",

People are more likely to record with someone they don\u2019t know yet than to have someone they don\u2019t know mix or produce their stuff.\n\nAs a producer, I\u2019d deny free offers from new mixer to mix what I\u2019m working on unless I have heard their work and I like them. I\u2019ve had people ask if I need mixing and offered through their relationship with the artists- it always came back fucked\u2026 at least so far. So try to get in with producers through offering other stuff like engineering in writing sessions. Comp and tune the demo vocals you got from the writing session, if you do a great job they\u2019ll more likely to give it a go with you. Don\u2019t ask too early, make sure you build a good rapport with them first. Vocal tuning can fuck things up just as bad as mixing, so try to find things where you can just do it (e.g. you just recorded vocals for someone) over asking people if they need their vocals tuned.",

    "question": "My advice is to have in person interactions as much as possible. When it comes to making records at a super high level (intense, stressful, high standards, egos, deadlines, freakouts, etc), you need to build a level of trust that for me is impossible without spending time with a person.\n\nIt doesn't mean you can't build a career remotely, but it's harder. Not only is it harder to build trust, but the remote option is available to anyone with an internet connection. So you're competing with a much larger pool of people too.\n\nDoes that mean move to LA or London or Miami or wherever? Not necessarily. But finding a way to get in person with the kinds of people you want to work with is extremely important",

I've done similar gigs twice before, and those were through recommendations, so I feel like I've been doing something right thus far. Can anyone ball park what someone like me, who is relatively amateur, would charge for something like this? \nI plan on renting some extra equipment for this session also, so that's another factor.\nHope someone can provide some insight,\nThank!",

Instead, he carefully clip gains each transient/syllable/word/phrase into his dynamic processing (e.g., compressor, saturation, limiter), giving him precise control over how hard he hits the limiter.\nI suppose another method to achieve similar results and that level of control would be to clip gain without processing, and then initiate a limiter (or your choice of dynamic processor) and automate the threshold and output to achieve the desired performance, but that seems like way more work to me.\nI think Jon's method works well and I've been using it myself for a while. It would be interesting to hear of alternative workflows from the rest of the community though!",

Often times your favorite plugins will do combos of these, so flipping the phase on one side will sometimes kill some of your wideness.\n\nIt's worth doing a google, but something like a flanger is simply duplicating the signal and micro delaying one of them at a variable rate. So the duplicated signal might oscillate between 2-20 milliseconds, which makes that crazy flanger sound. If you take that duplicated signal and run it through an aggressive filter (which will introduce some phase shift) and that's what a phaser is. \n\nYou can play with multiple duplicate signals, flipping phase on one side and getting wild effects. You can play with pitch on the delayed signal and start getting an effect we call \"chorus.\" But of course, each of these types of effects are just combinations of fundamental ways to manipulate audio. Many combos are possible!\n\nHooray sound design!\n\nAlso, I would love @Slow Hand to correct and expand, since I know he (and many others on here) are REAL sound design nerds.",

Throughout the live Matt & Jon talked about how it\u2019s helpful to bring every track down to somewhere around -6db in order to give enough headroom when mixing. It sounds like the goal is to build back up perceived volume through exciters and saturation, but are the loudest tracks staying at -6db post-mixing? Or, is the goal to get the fundamental parts of the song (kick, vocal, snare, bass, etc..) closer to 0db after adding these different plugins (saturators, exciters) that affect the output?",

So bear with me.\n\nSo I think I've somehow created two FB profiles.\n\nI have a FB profile that logs in using the same email address as my IG account. This FB account is devoid of content, except for a random photo of a houseplant that I set as my profile pic so that I could distinguish it from what I believe to be a separate FB account that is also paired to my Meta Business Suite account.\n\nThe reason I think I have two FB accounts is because when I log into the Meta Business Suite it has thumbnails for all of the linked accounts: My IG account (represented with my IG profile pic) and my FB account which is has a blank default profile image. Not the houseplant profile image on my 2nd FB account that I setup.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but I was able to post a \"test post\" to my \"blank\" FB account and in certain windows within the Meta Business Suite I can see that that test post was successfully posted to the timeline. However, on my \"houseplant\" FB profile the test post doesn't appear. So I feel confident that these are two separate profiles.\n\nNeedless to say the whole thing is perplexing and I cannot find the means to distinguish one from the other. I see one FB profile through the Meta Business Suite and I see the other FB profile when I log in through the FB website. It's a mess. \ud83e\udd26",

I HATE this thing, but I think in reality I really like most aspects of it (I/O, conversion, pres) and just hate the drivers.  It's glitchy, buggy, shitty, crackly, reboot-y.  Head's been dreaming about a new interface but the wallet has nightmares about a new interface, and an idea popped into my head.  Could I buy an RME Digiface USB and just connect the Zen Tour to it via adat?  Would that work?  Digiface is the interface and the Zen Tour is the monitor controller, converter, lines in/out, preamps?  Digiface is $400 at Thomann and that's a lot easier to swallow than a full-on replacement for the Zen Tour.",

In order for someone to give it a go with you, it would take some level of trust that they won\u2019t be getting back a fucked up mix. \n\nI\u2019m a producer that occasionally mix for others, and I found it the easiest to get in on earning people\u2019s trust by offering other things first. Record them, or tune vocals for them and then let them know you also mix. People are more likely to record with someone they don\u2019t know yet than to have someone they don\u2019t know mix or produce their stuff.\n\nAs a producer, I\u2019d deny free offers from new mixer to mix what I\u2019m working on unless I have heard their work and I like them. I\u2019ve had people ask if I need mixing and offered through their relationship with the artists- it always came back fucked\u2026 at least so far. So try to get in with producers through offering other stuff like engineering in writing sessions. Comp and tune the demo vocals you got from the writing session, if you do a great job they\u2019ll more likely to give it a go with you. Don\u2019t ask too early, make sure you build a good rapport with them first. Vocal tuning can fuck things up just as bad as mixing, so try to find things where you can just do it (e.g. you just recorded vocals for someone) over asking people if they need their vocals tuned.",

In order for someone to give it a go with you, it would take some level of trust that they won\u2019t be getting back a fucked up mix. \n\nI\u2019m a producer that occasionally mix for others, and I found it the easiest to get in on earning people\u2019s trust by offering other things first. Record them, or tune vocals for them and then let them know you also mix. People are more likely to record with someone they don\u2019t know yet than to have someone they don\u2019t know mix or produce their stuff.\n\nAs a producer, I\u2019d deny free offers from new mixer to mix what I\u2019m working on unless I have heard their work and I like them. I\u2019ve had people ask if I need mixing and offered through their relationship with the artists- it always came back fucked\u2026 at least so far. So try to get in with producers through offering other stuff like engineering in writing sessions. Comp and tune the demo vocals you got from the writing session, if you do a great job they\u2019ll more likely to give it a go with you. Don\u2019t ask too early, make sure you build a good rapport with them first. Vocal tuning can fuck things up just as bad as mixing, so try to find things where you can just do it (e.g. you just recorded vocals for someone) over asking people if they need their vocals tuned.",

A lot of the recordings are double mid/side and we're trying to figure out what's standard or expected in those industries when it comes to deliverables for multichannel recordings. 3 channel for the client to decode? 4ch? 4 stems front, back, L, R? Mono front, mono back, stereo L/R? maybe a long shot but does anyone have experience in this world?",

    "question": "Let me preface by saying nothing tangible has got me feeling down or discouraged. In fact I think I'm in the best season of my life so far and it feels like everything is going right (aside: aren't you more likely to self sabotage when things are good than when they are bad?) to zoom out a little bit, i already know the answer. I'm doing too much at once, spreading myself thin beyond enjoyment. in the grit of a transition and it's clear where I'm going but I have no frame of reference for the timeline. A few years ago, I was mid-20s, in a band on a major, had roommates & cheap rent, and a chess app addiction. i was still a \"professional\" but things were extremely simple. in short, left the band, spent a few years mixing much more than producing, and now am swinging back that way. I'm about to turn 30, I have a mortgage, a (semi) dependent, my first real studio, an intern to set an example for, 5ish mixing clients at any moment, producing for 3 artists and co-prod/consulting on 2 other projects, playing occasionally in any of 4 different bands, and producing/recording some live performances (as well as starting a YT channel in this lane). In my experience at least, it really seems like something shifted at the top of this year, and I hate to say it but part of the fault is TikTok (is the rest of the fault mine?). Everything is urgent to everyone and nothing informs each other or oscillates together. It feels like a clock is constantly going \"tick, tock, tick, tock\" and the anxiety I once had over money is shifted completely towards my time management. Every time I look away from my phone I have 30 new texts. I think I'm crushing it in my professional demands but I don't know that I'm being the person I want to be for my friends, family and partner. I don't know that I'm setting a good example to this intern. I don't know that I'm there to take care of myself all the way.",

    "question": "I'm curious: Does anyone here have any insight into the drum sound on Foo Fighters \"My Hero?\" It's a really wild drum sound. Whenever I'm driving and that song comes on the radio it always piques my interest... I've been sifting through a few different reference tracks recently, and I just listened to it on headphones for the first time. They do some really wild stereo stuff with the drums in the intro and the chorus - You can hear it really pronounced on headphones. It's actually a little disconcerting hearing the cymbals basically mirroring each other in the left and right like that - and the snare, too. The cymbals also have a very pronounced \"BWEEESHHH...\" sound. It's a very unique sound... I suspect there were a lot of room mics going on in that sound, but of course I have no idea. Anyway, would love to hear from anyone who might know.",

I like to record all my drums live with a good player, but it seems to scratch that itch for demos when programmed drums are the only option. Before I grab it, is there any other live drum plugin you suggest I try? Looking for authentic sounding stuff with deep interfaces. Got the likes of Tympo and Butch Vig already - fun toys but only a little different than skimming splice. Would prefer to emulate the experience of producing live drums as closely as possible",

In this case, while I'd focus my attention on getting some reps in on various mixing projects, there's certainly room to grow in your equipment stable. Headphones are a great starting point and will likely continue to be useful down the road, but mixing on speakers helps you make things translate better to the real world (car & home stereos, public spaces, etc). So a pair of decent entry level monitors would be my next purchase. It will also prove useful for collaborating with other folks down the road as you can all hear the same thing from the same source.",

With the Rough Ryder mention - Are you referring to the compressor by Audio Damage or is there another one (distortion plugin?)? Also, i was thinking about this recently: I wonder if one of the reasons I'm not super stoked with my room mic sound is because i recorded them through the spdif on the back of my interface Yeah - When i was getting started, i didn't have that many channels, so i kind of \"sacrificed\" my room mics by sending them through the spdif inputs so that i could use my pres for more important stuff. They honestly don't sound bad to me, but i was wondering if that could be a reason why i just never got them to fit well in the mix - crappy spdif or something just not gelling well. That's probably a silly thought.",

I\u2019m contemplating 2 options right now:\n\n1. leave desk where it is and just set up monitors on desk, however I\u2019m worried about reflections/modes and that corner having a weird affect on what I hear. \n\n2. I remove the bookshelf, scoot the drums back to the wall, and place the desk against the wall parallel to  the drums. \n\nLastly, I\u2019ve gotten a quote from GiK on panels, but I\u2019m also talking to LA Sound Panels right now for a quote. If you guys have any acoustic recommendations feel free to share, thanks so much!",

So you'll lose $1k on average, but in actual real life it's a binary outcome: either -$10k or -$0. Insurance mitigates that variance, but not for free. So you don't just pay $1000, it gets marked up, and  you might pay the insurance company $1200 to insure against that $10,000 risk. The numbers are very very simplified to make the point briefly.",

        "content": "When you sing, you want to be as relaxed as possible. The moment it starts to feel like it hurts STOP. Breathing correctly also helps. When you breathe in, push your stomach out. You\u2019re effectively getting the air into your diaphragm which is where you want the power to come from. When you breathe in, kinda do it like you\u2019re yawning. That opens up the back of your throat (pause). Ideally you want your throat to act as a channel that your voice comes out of. If you look in the mirror while you sing, there\u2019s this little bulge in your throat (like an Adam\u2019s apple) - that\u2019s your larynx. You wanna keep that either centered or moving down. You\u2019ll notice if you start singing and you\u2019re straining, it\u2019ll start moving up, closer to your chin. That\u2019ll eventually hurt your voice.\n\nSorry if that\u2019s a lot. I have more lol but I just wrote what I could off the top of my head.\n\nEdit: oh yea! When you\u2019re warming up, do lip trills or hum into a straw! Like a 5 note scale going up and down. Starting from the bottom of your range to the top (before I starts to hurt).  That gets the sound to what\u2019s called the \u201cmask\u201d of your face. That also takes the stress off of your throat when you sing.",

My band just released an EP that I mixed and mastered, since we don't have budget to hire someone else to do it. \n\nI've read up on normalization, have used streaming preview occasionally on RX, and most of the songs are coming in at an integrated -10 or -9lufs, which I thought would result in more information being preserved and transients not being cut as much, but I have to turn up the songs in my car much more than other songs when I compare. \n\nIs it as simple as turning them up to -8,-7? I thought doing so would result in losing more transient information once it hits the codec, but maybe that's wrong. Any insight appreciated.",

So if you're playing a song in E major, don't tune your open G string to a g, but fret it at the first fret and tune that to a G# instead. That will help a lot as well in my experience.",

Some come through your network of music friends, some come from doing exceptional work and people further along in their career taking notice, and some come from applying to the various \"looking for an assistant with xyz qualifications\" posts you see here and on social media.\n\nI made an album with a local band called the Matches up in Oakland. They started getting attention from record labels and big producers in LA. I moved to LA and met Eric Valentine who liked the album and met with the band. I asked if I could intern for him. He said he didn't have interns but I should stay in touch cause sometimes they hired extra help. I called him every two weeks for the next six months until an opportunity opened up. Then I assisted him for five years while making indie records on the side.",
