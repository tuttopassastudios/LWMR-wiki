    "content": "Strange I find most people hearing tuning/intonation better with a bass element in the mix. If I\u2019m tuning multiple vocals, I tune the lead and mute other melodic instruments that might be distracting. Then tune  doubles to the lead, tune  the harmony with the lead, tune the  doubled harmonies to the tuned harmony and so on. I try to move fast not worrying about it being perfect and I then solo all the vocals together the see how they feel or put them back in the mix. As I\u2019m working on the song if something feels off I\u2019ll scope it out then. For me It\u2019s very easy to get into a hyper tuning mode where everything sounds like it needs tuned if I obsess over it. I find it better to do a broad stroke pass and fine tune things as needed",

Hire a decent vocal coach and do a few vocal lessons (even a single lesson with a great teacher is important). You will get someone to teach you in-person how to breathe properly (that's the power source for the instrument you're learning). ALSO, you'll come away with a recording of a vocal warm up (somewhere between 5-20 minutes usually). YOU WILL THEN:\n\n3. Start EVERY day with vocal warm ups.\n\n4. Do whatever else you want to do that gets you singing a lot. Make it fun. I like learning songs, doing a voice memo every time I sing, and occasionally listening back. I sing bob dylan songs for my girlfriend. I record tons of vocals for songs I'm working on. Etc",

Just wanted to check in here for some morale/mental advice, and possibly some technical advice. \n\nBasically ive been workig with this artist for almost a year now, and he\u2019s by far my biggest client (both how often he books me and how many listeners). We\u2019ve grown really close personally, but we are currently in the midst of doing a mix for his favorite song hes done yet. He expressed to me that he is frustrated that after all this time, i am still unable to get in the ballpark for his vocal mixes within the first handful of versions. He expressed that he\u2019d rsther a much more formulaic copy and paste approach, but i explained to him that every song is different, etc etc. in the end, we ended up importing the vocal chain from one of his older songs and it definitely sounded better, having me questioning my skills with his stuff and leaving me feeling a bit embarrassed because i worked for 2 hours on the other vocals that sounded worse (he is sending me raw untuned vocals). Lemme preface this by saying that i dont have this issue with any other client ever, and ive gotten amazing feedback from our final mixes that we\u2019ve put out, just not the inital ones. Anybody ever struggle with this before? Not sure how i should take this and how i can be better for the sake of my work with him and others.",

(This is in a perfect world where the beat is mixed perfectly and has the right amount of space for the vocal). I see this is how a lot of people are running sessions and how they are mixing demos, to either release or send out to mix & master.

Is that the point of having daily vocal warm ups, where they're meant to keep you going for 4+ hours of singing when needed? Just trying to be pretty cautious of how I start out so I don't potentially build harmful habits with singing.",
