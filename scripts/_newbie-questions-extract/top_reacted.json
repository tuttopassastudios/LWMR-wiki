    "content": "1) a strong work ethic: You have to be willing to put in the time and energy into the project. You will always be the first person there and the last to leave. Once you accept this and work it into your life, it just becomes the way it is!\n\n2) a good personality: You need to be good around people. Half of this job is psychological. You have to know when to speak up as well as when to not say anything. Talkback etiquette is crucial. Learn to read people. Never get angry or passive aggressive. You always need to be voice of reason. People have to trust you.\n\n3) a solid skill-set: You have to always know what your doing and be confident in your abilities. Know the technical side of things. You should also be musically inclined. Be curious! Why does a song sound a certain way? How did they do it? If you don't care and don't want to know \u2013 you should do something else.\n\n4) actual follow through: You'd be surprised how many flaky people work in this business. If you're a guy that does things when you say you'll do them and answers phonecalls/emails in a timely manner, then you're already leagues above most other people.\n\n5) the ability to network with people and capitalize on your relationships is the only way to move forward in this business. Going to shows, parties, events, etc. You never know where work is going to come from.\n\nYour work gets you work. Make sure everything you do is the best representation of your abilities. Don't choose which projects to care more about. Give it your all on everything... even if its a shitty gig. That word will spread and you'll start getting more work through that.\n\nHope this helpful. Good luck!",

Now pull the original song out and you\u2019ve got a new song with the scaffolding of a hit. Very useful trick.",

Critical of  Greg Wells pandering to whatever his base is. But recommending a 4k converter based on 'audible conversion quality' isn't helpful if the consumer doesn't have a million other ducks in a row first -- room treatment, adequate monitoring, proper gainstaging, etc. Jon has that figured out, so it makes sense for him. But when people come into a forum with questionable knowledge and background in music production asking what's the best converter, I think it's fair to ask some prying questions before just making blanket recommendations on what one person heard or not. I have plenty of semi-OK stuff that still gets used on the regular, and plenty of expensive gear that I would happily toss out of my workflow. They're all just tools. And whether its bougie DW Fearn or a black-friday Acustica plugin, , if it works for your workflow and gets you results you're happy with, then its worth whatever money you're willing to pay for it.",

Having this perspective is massively useful in mixing other peoples tracks, because I feel I have a north star of what good drums can sound like if they\u2019re recorded and performed properly. It used to be that my starting point for mixing drums were working with tracks that I had recorded myself\u2026 and most of the above problems were solved before the mix stage. These days, with smaller budgets and time constraints, its very rare that this is a possibility.\n\nI\u2019m including this drum tracking session from a few years ago that I recorded at Barefoot. It was for a project that Matt was producing that never saw the light of day. But we went all out with the drum setup in the big room, through the console, and had a great drummer. This might be useful for some people who have never gotten properly recorded drum tracks\u2026 to get a sense of how good thigns can sound before the \u2018mix\u2019 stage. These are the tracks that were printed into Pro Tools off of the console, and the three busses were prints of the outboard compressor busses we were using while monitoring. It\u2019s unlikely these busses would get used in mixing, but they\u2019re a good reference to what we were listening to in the room while we were tracking. But as you\u2019ll notice, the individual drum blend can stand on it\u2019s own two feet. Hopefully this is useful as well.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

Now  I am just trying to inspire the artists and writers around me, I'll deal with the sonics later. Much better results.\n\nI also used to fully mix-as-I-go, which painted me into a corner with gain staging and eq. Now when I get to the end of the process, I often pull things back and rebuild my levels so there's headroom and I can make that exciting production translate.\n\nDifferent approaches for different parts of the process.",

After that, all negotiations were done as that new number being my base rate, and anything less was a discount (I love the idea above of marking that discount on the invoice so your full rate is still shown). I sort of felt guilty for awhile charging that much, thinking I wasn't at that level, but then started to notice most clients instantly started to get pretty close to that number, where before they were half of that.

Go fuck it mode. You need to have a ton of contacts. Take a lot of shots. Of course I have no idea about what you are doing currently...but zero people I've ever talked to in this situation have taken enough shots. \"I reached out to 5 people this week\"...no. HUNDREDS. Most people will ignore you. But just keep going. Watch a Goggins video before you start or something haha\n\nReally think about the experience of working with you. Is it amazing? Is it easy? Is your communication, care, intention incredible? Even things like how files are named/delivered/etc matters. You can only be as good as you are at mixing until you get more reps. But you can control how you interact and the professionalism and confidence you can inspire on the other side.\n\nIf someone lets you mix a song...are they coming back? They need to if you are going to have a business doing this!\n\nSorry to be prescriptive here...but I've seen this question asked of me enough to know that it's so so hugely about just brutal persistence in many aspects, assuming you have talent, etc to do the actual thing.",

    "content": "The landscape for pitching songs has changed dramatically in the last decade. It still exists, but it has shrunk to the point where even the top level writers can't rely on it as much.\n\nThis is simply because many more people can write songs and make demos quickly. This results in two things: the market is flooded with songs, and artists who used to rely on pitch songs are now writing (or co-writing) the majority of their material.\n\nMany songs that used to be sent to an artist are now brought into the room and finished with the artist themselves. Like, you'd pitch a chorus or a 3/4 finished song to an artist and finish with them on the spot.\n\nThe genres where pitching songs still predominates are country the (industry is still writer\u2013driven), EDM (many artists are performers who do not write or produce), and pop (but they're mostly just looking for HITS).\n\nAnother consequence of this shrinking pitch landscape is that the projects that need \"outside\" songs are much more gate-kept by people in the industry. In country, there are publishers and labels that generally source the songs. In pop, labels and executive producers (of specific projects) tend to be the gate keepers, and in EDM it is a similar combo.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the best way to pitch songs is to build direct relationships with artists or go through the various business people who gate-keep the process.\n\nTo advise you based on your question: make incredible records with your friends, peers, and the people around you, and get visibility that way. Hustle like crazy and use every moment of new visibility as a stepping stone to get in the mix with the larger music community. Ultimately you probably sign a publishing deal and sing with a manager where you get business representatives to help guide you and connect you further.\n\nAs with all things music, if you actually really for real make A+ records, people will find you. It's just that this is a lot harder than people think.",

Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively)\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

Instead, you were surrounded by expert speakers and learned through interactions with people who were leagues ahead of you in their ability to speak the language.

    "content": "It's a big topic, but gain staging is about finding the optimal amount of gain at every stage of the recording and mixing process.\n\nGood gain staging allows you to get the best fidelity out of a recording by preventing things from creating unwanted distortion or amplifying unwanted noise. **OR** if you are *seeking* some distortion and compression it's about turning up the gain enough to give you the amount that you're seeking from your tools.\n\nGain staging is something to be considered at all steps of the production process. For example:\n\n*1. How loud is an amplifier turned up in the room? Is the microphone being blow out by it?\n\n2. How high is the gain on a microphone preamp and is it at risk of clipping if the performer plays loudly?\n\n3. Is the gain so low that when I turn a signal up later on the noise floor will rise with it?\n\n4. If I'm recording to tape, am I recording quiet enough that it won't saturate the signal, or do I want for the signal to slam the tape and be saturated?\n\n5. How loud is an individual channel in a DAW? Is it making the channel clip?\n\n6. How loud is a signal that's being sent into a piece of hardware or a plugin? Am I distorting the circuitry at all?\n\n7. Is my signal coming in so hot that it makes a compressor react way too hard?\n\n8. How loud is the entire track I'm mixing? Is the limiter crushing the dynamics in an unwanted way? Or am I hitting it just with just enough level to get a certain flavor of pumping and clipping?\n\n9. Is my final mix going to hit digital zero and create unwanted clipping?*\n\nSo gain staging is not a single thing, but a series of choices that are made every step of the way around how you manage the \"voltage\" of your signals. Together these choices all add up to a mix that \"breathes\" well and is free of excessive or unwanted distortion.",

It's not bad, but it's not as fun to use as the other options, and I think that has an effect on your results.\n\nBoth the FabFilter Mastering bundle and Soundtoys bundle are great and you wouldn't go wrong with either pick. But they occupy different niches: FabFilter is clean and surgical while Soundtoys is all about injecting vibe and coloration and doesn't include anything remotely surgical.\n\nI guess if you can only pick one I'd start with Soundtoys for the vibe and the way it would expand the sonic palette for your production work. Your DAW is going to have some perfectly capable EQ's and compressors to tide you over until you're ready for FabFilter.\n\nPut another way, your production work is upstream of your mixing work and will influence the sound of your records more.",

There's a technical baseline that you want to ensure your mixer can meet -- it's usually pretty obvious when they're hitting below it. Like Noah said, a personal connection is great because it usually makes the communication a little easier. They'll be less precious about reaching out to you for feedback/additional files/etc and you'll be more candid in your feedback. Also, if you haven't worked with that person, very easy to find people who have and shoot them a quick note. \"How was your experience? Would you hire them again?\" From there you can just go down the list of pricing, availability, etc.",

There are lots of things that go into making a record, and a little clipping here and there isn\u2019t gonna be the difference in a song hitting or not. \n\nBut also- allowing yourself to be curious without being fearful... Taking someone\u2019s note and asking, without judgment, if there\u2019s something you might\u2019ve missed, is worthwhile.\n\nDeeper still, and I\u2019m still working this out: taking the blame and taking the credit are the same thing, I think. Admitting you were wrong can be a sort of superpower, and all the sting and shame disappear and all you\u2019re left with is the learning and growing and relationship building. Walls go down on all sides and it becomes a team effort again. \n\nIt\u2019s real easy to let ego ruin a good feeling. Being able to say \u201cshit what did I miss?\u201d is wayyyy easier than saying \u201cbut I already said it was good so i can\u2019t go back on it\u2026\u201d it takes longer to get there sometimes, but in the end it\u2019s the path of least resistance. \n\nBBQ Sauce.",

    "content": "I have a couple distinct phases of my workflow. The \u201ctechnical\u201d phase let\u2019s call it, is all about letting my brain objectively search for the very specific kinds of things that are distracting within the mix at hand. This is much more of a thinking and corrective process than it is a feeling one, even though feeling and taste is 100% involved. This part of the process is to get the mix on a more solid foundation if needed.\n\nThe next phase is where I want to actively NOT be thinking at all. This is why I do the first part separately. I want to be FEELING the music in this phase and not be taken out of it by the vocal resonance at 1.8k at 1:35 in the bridge. I want to turn that part of my brain off so I can focus on the music, the feeling, the lyrics, the intent, the song and try to find where (or if) I can elevate or reveal or better frame the heart of what\u2019s there. This is meant to be the flow state, moving intuitively and viscerally based on what\u2019s coming out of the speakers. This is where efficiency in toolset matters -- where an extremely efficient human-computer interaction matters, where knowing your tools cold matters. I want to reduce latency between feeling and move and I don\u2019t want anything to get in my way. \n\nSo to answer your question: I think about ways to continue to be able to access and preserve that crucial flow state during the time where it matters the most. And it can manifest a million ways that aren\u2019t directly related to mastering at all: taking a walk, working out, doing a J, listening to a new record, checking Discord, unplugging, whatever. And yes, sometimes it also means refining my template or my Streamdeck shortcuts or creating a new preset.",

If you mic that amp with a single mic, that mono signal has the reverb as a part of it. When you pan that complete signal, it carries a kind of depth and character that is very different from a stereo reverb or even a separate send. \n\nMono elements with their own reverb can achieve an interesting spatial clarity that you can't get with eq or compression or whatever else you use to give elements their own place in a mix.
