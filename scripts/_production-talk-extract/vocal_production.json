I\u2019m talking actually nudging things around, not stretching. Then I\u2019ll consolidate and drop into Melodyne. In Melodyne I\u2019ll turn the whole thing and also really pay attention to the timing. At this stage it\u2019s a lot more stretching and/or compressing notes, or more importantly PARTS of words. Like I\u2019ll separate the consonant, and time compress that and bring up the volume so ccchhhhhhhhair becomes CHaaaaiiirrrr. (If that makes any sense). Then back into ProTools. Double check for any weirdness, comp back in the untuned bits you can get away with if you want. Then I\u2019ll do a final cleaning up of group Esses, do my little what I call Swedish time stretching technique, REALLY pocket and polish the vocals. Then I send it off to the label who needed it yesterday but somehow don\u2019t get back to me for 6 months.",

Making the artist feel safe enough to be dangerous, knowing how hard you can push them to get a take, knowing where the line is between their vision and yours, etc\u2026\n\nSonics. I want my artists to feel expensive when they\u2019re recording, so getting the mic and cue mix right is everything. \n\nSpeed. A comp up by the time they\u2019re done tracking, a quick shine to make it feel special, and a bounce for them to take with them.\n\nEverything else is on a per session basis. I can deliver a fully mixed/tuned vocal and everything in between, so it all depends on communication ahead of time.",

Think Andrew Watt handled the vocals on that and did a fantastic job getting the take out of Luke. Dance Hall Days by Wang Chung is always a good reference. Mercy Street by Peter Gabriel (the whole SO record) pretty unfuckwithable. Bang Bang is always a great reference because you can really show a singer the difference between a Jessie J and an Arianna.

Audible signal at approx. -36 dBFS was present during playback.\n\nFurthermore, each instance of Melodyne did not detect the audio identically. The plugin version detected Tone #1 at +48 ct, while ARA and Standalone detected it at + 50 ct. No difference was noted in the detected pitch center of Tone #2 between the three instances.\n\n**DISCUSSION**\n\nTesting showed Beckley, et al. (2023) to be correct in asserting that Melodyne does not behave identically between its plugin, ARA and standalone versions. Differences do not appear limited to the tuning algorithm, but indeed the detection algorithm as well. The relative subjective quality of tuning results between these versions cannot, however, be determined by the present test. Further testing and qualitative evaluation may be needed to add to the literature and determine the most preferable version of Melodyne to use for tuning purposes.",

I often detune L/R doubles of a lead by a few 10ths of a cycle (like take the left channel to 439.4hz and the right channel to 440.6hz in auto tune) to help separate them.\n\nThis is actually what a \"chorus\" effect is meant to do. When you actually get a bunch of great singers together to sing the same thing, their different timbres and slightly different pitches will add up to a very rich sound you can't get from stacking one tuned voice. That's what the effect called \"chorus\" is essentially trying to mimic with slight detune and delay.\n\nNot sure if this is a topic we've covered much but I know @BatMeckley and @Slow Hand have thoughts",

    "content": "I will say this, on the topic of standing up for yourself -- I've seen a couple times in these threads now a general sentiment of accepting that people are gonna kick you around. It felt evident when we were riffing on sliding scale mixing rates last month and it felt evident this morning/last night in here. I'm all in on the greyhound sentiment, I've been a grafter through and through since I was in elementary school skipping homework to double up on piano practice. I once drove 7 hours to buy a Juno-60 on Craigslist and the guy didn't answer the door; I make DUMB life decisions all centered around this non-negotiable gravity towards the art. I can promise I have whatever that obsessive brain disorder thing is that we all keep riffing about (and believe the same for the grand majority here). But can we not practice a little self preservation along the way? Nobody besides your team is really gonna stick up for you; I believe that in line with the all the professional metrics there exists the opportunity/need to set  precedents on how you want to be treated. I don't think this is something that *comes* with being a great producer, I think it's something that *contributes* to someone becoming a great producer. And of course, knowing how to ask for that fairness with a kind/patient/assertive/flexible tone is critical. But if I believe something is a little crooked in the system, I'd rather not wait till I hopefully arrive a decade later on the other side of the fence to be able to do something about it. I would rather make an attempt at being heard now and see whether it makes any progress, even if it just gives some suit on an email thread something to think about. It's not for the sake of my own ego, it's for the sake of our entire breed.",

    "content": "The method that sounds most transparent is hand editing (no digital stretching at all). You need to line up your edits so the wave form is perfect in the middle of each note, then use an equal gain cross fade at the edit point. This gives you the most transparency because there is no algorithmic stretching happening. \n\nIt limits very slightly your options with timing because bass wave forms are long, so lining them up perfectly means you can only move the timing the length of each waveform. It's also time consuming compared to stretching.\n\nIf you are editing a DI that is then going through significant processing (amp sims and shit), you can sometimes get away with one of the stretching algorithms. Elastic audio is ok and usable sometimes, but I prefer Ableton's complex mode over everything else I've heard.\n\nI try to avoid time stretching artifacts on lead vocals and bass instruments more than anything else (unless it's creatively interesting of course).",

    "content": "Wanted to share some thoughts spurred on by a recent experience on here. So a local artist has hired me to produce two of her songs. Vibe is singer-songwriter, soul, RnB.\n\nWe tracked drums, bass, and keys live in the studio OD'd to scratch tracks we cooked up together. The scratch tracks / demos were just guitar vocal and we were really relying on the players to fill out the arrangements, but we knew more would be added down the line.\n\nAll the players were incredible. Could singe your eyebrows off with technical prowess and shredtastic chops. Tracks turned out great, still working on the arrangement, but..\n\nThis project has got me thinking more about the importance of how you present a song to session musicians and the 'space' you ask them to fill in a production. As well as the changing dynamics project to project affected by a revolving cast of participants, more fleshed out demos, etc... I find this a really interesting topic. Curious if anyone in the group has any unique experiences or insights whether as a producer or a musician.\n\nI've found that the more I flesh out demos with the artist beforehand the more bound and limited the session players we bring in are based off our decisions. This can make ODs more efficient, add a clearer direction, but can also remove the opportunity for the player to really add something special. Sometimes I don't want to be too suggestive b/c I want the players to have more of a blank canvas to work with.",

    "content": "Good question! \n\nAs @cian riordan said, when you're perfectly lining up the waveform of any solid tone, you want equal gain so it doesn't give you a boost on the crossfade. This is for \"correlated\" signals where the waveform is lining up exactly. A bass guitar, the middle of a vocal note, a synth with a consistent waveform, etc.\n\nWhen you're doing a crossfade on noise (breaths, sss's, ambience between drum hits, etc), you want equal power because these \"uncorrelated\" signals need a bit of boost around the crossfade for the perceived loudness to be the same.\n\nYou can check this by using a synth note or long vocal note, doing an edit to make it longer or shorter, lining up the waveforms perfectly, and doing a cross fade. You will find that equal power causes a volume bump. Equal gain will be smooth.\n\nDo the same thing with white noise and this time equal power will be smooth, while equal gain will cause a volume dip.",

Flex tune allows you to hit notes that aren't allowed in the key; higher the value, more time you're allowed on that note before it'll snap you to a note in the key. I'll keep it pretty low usually but it all depends on the vocalist. I've never really fucked with natural vibrato. Humanize is nice. Let's longer sustained notes wobble a bit even at high retune speeds. Sometimes I'll really crank it, but it does take away from the autotune effect if that's what you're going for.\nOne other tip is I like to flip to advanced mode and set major/minor in the bottom section (leave top drop down in chromatic). This allows you to bypass or allow certain notes that aren't in the key. So if you wanna hit that flat seven now and then, bingo",

(2023) reported differences in tuning results between the plugin and standalone versions of Melodyne. This investigator undertook a test of Melodyne plugin, ARA and standalone versions to determine whether the resulting tuned audio would null.\n\n**METHODS**\n\nAll testing was performed at a sample rate of 48kHz and with .wav files at a bit depth of 32 bits. Tuning was tested using two 2-second square wave tones generated with FabFilter One in Logic Pro X. Tone #1 was generated at a constant pitch of C4 +50ct. Tone #2 was generated at a pitch of C4 with the following settings: Modulation Generator (MG) Frequency set to 4.033 Hz,  MG waveform set to value 0.500, and Frequency Modulation MG set to value 0.123. Each tone was printed on a separate channel as a Bounce-in-place (bip). The two bips were then joined into a single, 6-second, mono .wav file with 2 seconds of silence between the bips. The 6-second .wav file was copied onto two new channels in Logic Pro X, and dragged out of Logic Pro onto the desktop for use in Melodyne standalone.\n\nAudio was transferred into Melodyne: one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne non-ARA, one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne ARA, and the copy of the .wav file on the desktop was loaded into Melodyne standalone. All transfers were completed using the Melodic (Standard) algorithm. \n\nTransferred audio was quantized to pitch C4, offset 0 ct, Pitch Modulation 0.0%, Pitch Drift 0.0%. All other settings were left at defaults; Note Assignment mode was checked to verify that Playback Type in each case was 'Tonal'. \n\nResulting audio was printed and imported into three new mono channels in Logic Pro X. Null testing was performed using the phase invert feature in Logic Pro X's stock 'Gain' plugin.",

The first thing is: the correction is only as good as the detection\u2026 so it\u2019s worth a quick run through to make sure it\u2019s mapped the vocal take properly.  Sometimes it gets a syllable or two in the wrong octave, and rarer times it\u2019ll get it wrong a fourth or fifth off. I\u2019m not sure the process for correcting that in the plug in off the top of my head. Once you\u2019ve got the detection right\u2026\n\nThe  next step is understanding how we fundamentally sing; a note tends to have a front end or consonance, the meat of the note, and then lastly the tail. You want to separate the meat of the note out, and concentrate on tuning that. Also remember that the \u201cblob\u201d is just an average of the tuning info in it, meaning if your note slides from C to E, melodyne will correct that blob to D. (I hope that makes sense.)",

I'm no Beckley, but browsing whats been previously shared here and trial and error has been the mechanism of growth for me.\n\nI kinda had the note separation tool workflow down from work in other programs. I've been experimenting with the time tool and attack speed tool as well as formant shifting to mask when the tuning becomes more audible than I'd like. That's probably where I'd pinpoint the level up for me personally. That and trying to be more conscious about not relying too much on the graphical UI. Unless it's something that really calls for hard tuning I lean towards wanting it to feel invisible / natural. Im realizing more what parts of the note actually need to be more 'on' and which can be more 'off' or just left alone. That and letting notes naturally drift to become more sharp as they tail off. If I'm too heavy handed it starts to feel lifeless to me. I'm also appreciating more the nuance of how one might approach different genres or styles with melodyne. Its humbling how powerful the program really is.\n\nThere've been a few moments with the attack speed tool that have felt like magic curing some subtleties of the performances that bug me, but I don't feel super confident that I have a grasp on that one yet. I've been working in standalone and importing a REF mix. For some reason I feel more confident dealing with esses in protools with RX or clip gain than I do melodyne idk why. Some frustrations have been flipping back and forth between tracks when tuning multiple files feels real clunky. I might be missing something about how best to do that. I wish, like with RX monitor, you could hear the vocal through your mix chain when tuning (is that possible?). Being able to rename exported files would be nice too like in RX.",

Why don\u2019t we take a break? When we come back, let\u2019s forget about everything I mentioned earlier and see how things come out when you express freely. I have a feeling that it\u2019s gonna turn out way better. I\u2019m sorry, I think I got it your way\u201d \n\nthen after the break, the artist started nailing the takes. Not in the exact way I imagined, but in the best possible way that we were capable of THAT DAY. \n\nSince then, I decided to let go of control a bit more and let the artists do their thing as much as I can. I started developing ears for hearing what artists can work on before the session to get a better recording to my best of ability (if I get to know them before the sesh). I would only mention the simple things that can be improved with small adjustments short-term. That way the session can be more experimental and wild as opposed to fault-finding.",

Many converters don\u2019t use -18dBFS=4dBu (or 0dBFS=22dBu) though, they all vary and lots are adjustable.\n\nTLDR is as long as you aren\u2019t clipping, you\u2019re good.",

Once you get an idea of how her particular voice stacks, you can eq on the way in and save some time. \n3rdly, getting the performance as close to perfect as you can instead of tuning or auto-aligning will do a lot for the stereo field and vitality of the overall sound. \n\nIf you\u2019re just talking about the lead vocal, Multiband or Dyanmic Eq is your friend, but absolutely CRUSH that LV with something that has inherent low end saturation like Devil Loc (at like a 2) or a UAD 175-B. That\u2019ll help balance the overall eq of the vocal better than just an additive eq/saturation. \n\nI know that\u2019s a lot but hopefully that\u2019s helpful!",

I think a lot of what Taylor Skye is doing is taking sounds and then warping them/distorting them to shit using all of the \"wrong\" methods, and then just judging what comes out and deciding if it should be kept. I think there's a good hint of this in the lead sound at the start, where it's really out of rhythm and grainy, some notes seem to sort of \"break\" which reminds me of the results you get when you try to formant shift a verbed-out or polyphonic sound with little alterboy, or even abusing izotope RX on something that doesn't really need it (also, the RX de-reverb can do wild things to a sound you've put reverb on higher in the chain). Logic, which is what he uses, also has a lesser known formant shift that you can only get to by turning on flex pitch then adjusting in the side info bar, which can really take sounds into space. I haven't done this with melodyne, but I imagine there are some similar features.",

The original Massive had a lot of aliasing that could make it sound hazy and flat. Switching over to Massive X it is crystal clear and even buzzy saw waves feel warm, pure, and tactile.\n\nIt has extremely flexible modulation capabilities that I find to be very musical as well as some very comprehensive ADSHR envelopes. It also has four different keyboard tracking curves that you can assign and tweak, which is very important when fine-tuning your patch to make sure that it sounds even across the entire range of keys.\n\nIt has a lot of musical sounding filters that can inject a ton of vibe, or be completely neutral. The *noise* section is robust and very flexible. I use it a lot.\n\nFinally, it has a great-sounding set of internal effects (delay, chorus, saturation, verb, etc) that can be placed anywhere inside of the routing diagram. It's always a bummer when the on-board effects aren't very inspiring. But NI has a strong catalog of well-designed dsp to draw on and integrate into their products, so it's turned out great.\n\nOverall, it's a very robust and well-rounded synthesizer that also does a lot of things extremely well. It can be super clean (like Serum) but also get very dirty, which I appreciate in a synth.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that the preset browser kind of sucks. I prefer the original Massive's browser. NI is well aware and they have been overhauling it and slowly adding new features, so I trust in time this will be made better.",

They do have CC control of every feature on the pedal including the hidden ones and an Ableton Max4Live plugin that allows you to recall settings and automate parameters.",

Audiences in the 1800s, for instance, could go to a symphonic concert and recognize sonata form, key centers, etc. There was an appreciation for the form of the music and the virtuosity of the player first and foremost. Acknowledgement of skill. Making things seem effortless was the ideal.\n\nContemporary listeners seem to connect more with the struggle. They want to hear the grit in the vocal, the player at the edge of their ability (whatever it may be) holding on for dear life. The mix at the edge of distortion. In that breaking point, there is a lot of beauty and emotion that would have traditionally been considered bad form. Uncouth, even!",

Then throw it into a vocal tracking session and get the demo vocals and get the song written and record a few too many parts. Then produce the song around the song and vocals. Usually I\u2019ll have beat and vocals separate, but sometimes it makes more sense to have in the same session. Depends on the song. But I always track over a 2 track. Because it takes a lot of risk out of having some random synth or plug-in chain from the production mess up the session while trying to get good takes with the artist.(total buzzkill if you have to restart a session when the vocalist is in the zone) \nBut again soooooo project dependant. Depends on how the artist likes to work, time line, amount of sessions that are possible to have together and so on. Sometimes you\u2019ll only have one day with an artist, and if you are also producing, leave all the cool production tricks til later and get the best vocals you can get.",

Both have their place for sure.\n\nOne thing you keyed in on that is really crucial is the \"space\" you ask them to fill. Even something as simple as \"ad lib between vocal lines\" tells the player a lot about where they need to fit in, while still giving them a lot of freedom to bring their thing to the production. \n\nCertainly a place for all of these approaches, and the more you know and trust the musicians around you, the easier it becomes to envision where it might go (and leave room for pleasant surprises).",

Modeling these behaviors is a good way to start thinking musically with a synthesizer.\n\nSo if I'm going for a \"horn\" instrument I want a patch that can do attack-y stabs, but also fade into notes and have complete dynamic control. It should also have some sort of brightness feature that I can open up at will, like blowing harder into some brass.\n\nIf I'm emulating a voice there's going to be a big emphasis on legato playing and fluidity, with some very expressive pitch control for bends and vibrato. Maybe some form of subtle formant control to shade the notes like a singer would with different vowel sounds.\n\nAn organ patch is going to be a dead simple note-on/note-off volume envelope with the expression coming from the addition or subtraction of different oscillators.\n\nAnd some patches are just going to be gangly chaotic messes that you do your best to wrangle. Something with a lot of chaos and feedback and squealing. You can't control it, but you just strap in.",

They don't understand how much effort goes into tuning or finessing a vocal performance. From their perspective they laid down a great one and when the final comp shows up sounding amazing they might assume that all you did was comp a few takes, EQ, add some compression and *voila*. They don't know about the hours and hours you spent getting it all just-so, listening, and then adjusting again. Not to mention your years of hard-won judgement that allow you to know when it's the correct move. That's all invisible to the client.\n\nOf course, pros will likely know all of this because they've had the experience enough times.

Helping people zoom out and focus on the FEEL difference that's been made seems like a start, but as we all know, it can be hard to see the forest for the trees. And if the artist is hyper-focused on how much reverb is on the vocal, they're losing the context of WHY the decision was made, and how it feels as a whole. \n\nI don't have answers here, but I'm curious of other's thoughts.",

It can take a lot of work to make something sound appropriately shitty. A lot of elements beyond straight distortion; filtering, small room, subtle flanging, etc. Speakerphone used to be great for this.

I\u2019ve since moved on by getting the best performance out of an artist (with the sound of autotune) and will only use Melodyne if I can hear a specific problem on a note that needs to be changed. So I guess I\u2019ve started getting better results with it after using it less and only after listening specifically for pitch errors. I know it can do a lot more but the many features rarely helped me make the vocal sound better.",

Elements which if muted would leave you feeling like something is missing but you can\u2019t necessarily make them out when in. \n\nI guess this could be anything from a few percussion loops (maybe panned/verb with no pre-delay or less high end to place them at the back of the mix) to a subtle vocal or foley sample playing one note throughout the groove. \n\nLayering to me is part of this but my intent with it is usually to create a sound or get more out of an element (like layering the attack of a snap with a clap for a different transient / texture). But this doesn\u2019t always add to \u201cfullness\u201d in my mind. It just makes one element better or more interesting. \n\nMaybe start with the loops and foley.

The fx also have great character to them, I often find that if I pull up a preset with time fx on it, something\u2019s really missing when I switch them off and pull up some other plugins in search of \u201cmore control.\u201d There\u2019s one thing in massive x that I really wish they\u2019d improve though, which serum does perfectly, and that\u2019s unison. I find it super annoying that massive x only has a global unison with 6 voices max, while on serum you can have between 1-16 voices per osc and configure the tuning and blend in all sorts of unique ways.

Think of them more like initialized synth templates with pre-determined routings and modulation that I can start with and then diverge from. I still use other people's presets, but using these templates can save me a good 15 minutes every time that I want to build a new patch and don't want to start all the way from scratch. They come with a lot of built-in expression.\n\nOn most of these I've got a lot of the keyboard tracking already tuned so that a bright patch doesn't get too harsh as I go up in register or it doesn't get too flabby and lose definition in the low-end.\n\nI've got one patch set up for very expressive pitch modulation. Lots of big sweeps and bends in the attack/release envelope phases. Think wonky Neptunes-type sounds or two-octave dive bombs. Stuff like that.\n\nOne patch is set for expressive filter and amplitude modulation. Wobbles, envelope modulations, and such. It's my go-to if I'm trying to play with some \"brassy\" dynamics.\n\nOne is a legato mono patch for very fluid vocal-like playing. A big emphasis on note articulation and variation. I think of it as a solo instrument.\n\nThe final one is (you called it) A nice poly synth. Think James Blake on a Prophet. Pretty standard stuff, but once again it's got keyboard tracking that's tuned up so that the patch feels rich across the entire range.",

    "content": "Wow, this is a dream come true on so many levels. I\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity to have someone listen to my Antares complaints! First, it\u2019s insanely glitchy on my M1 computer which is funny since this is the version that\u2019s supposed to be compatible. Still running Pro Tools through Rosetta but Auto Tune will consistently freeze up my sessions to the point of me uninstalling it and going back to the previous version. So that made it unusable for me right off the bat. Second, for some reason, it has a mix knob. Even if I wanted to blend an octave down or some effected vocal with the dry, I\u2019d want the dry to be in tune. Not a natural dry vocal against a tuned octave down. Third, the default in AAX I remember was the craziest setting. I forget exactly what it was but I remember spending 20 minutes just trying to get it to tune and relearn where everything was. My last  biggest issue is that I\u2019m pretty sure Code Meter (Antares iLok substitute) kicks Dante in the balls every time it wants to check my license. This means late packets on my DVS and in extreme circumstances, drop outs. Autotune doesn\u2019t even have to be in the session for this to happen. This is a hard issue to prove so I\u2019m still a little unsure if I\u2019m right about this one but after uninstalling everything Antares, this problem went away. Super niche issue but wanted to throw it in there since it\u2019s been causing gray hairs lately",

    "content": "So I was digging through the Discord for wisdom on comping/tidying/timing/tuning vocals and seems like there's some debate on whether one should time first or tune first. \n\nI like to time first, because:\n\n- AFAIK time-stretching tends to emphasize tuning artifacts, while tuning can actually mask timing artifacts depending on how drastic the timing was.\n\n- I'm often comping doubles from unused lead takes, and then doing a combination of Revoice and editing by hand to line them up, along with harmonies. I find this makes tuning easier, especially when to lining up a slide or melisma.\n\nHOWEVER\n\n- I could be mistaken/misinformed about the first point. I think the amount of artifacts also depends heavily on what DAW/algorithm was used for time-stretching, if it was done at all.\n\n- Tuning can mess with timing. We all saw the AT conversation a few days ago, and Matt Beckley pointed out in a post a while back that Melodyne can also make timing a little wonky sometimes.\n\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- Is this just one of those 'it depends' situations?\n\n- You can do both timing and tuning in Melodyne, although (to me) it feels a little more artifacty and a lot more time-consuming than working by hand and applying stretching, etc. as needed.\n\n@BatMeckley @NoahNeedleman I feel like you two probably have the most expertise here - advice greatly appreciated.",

    "content": "Method: Recorded vocal at 192kHz into Pro Tools. Exported via Shift+CMD+K at 192kHz and again at 48kHz. Vocals were both imported into Melodyne application in monophonic mode. Administered time stretching (both lengthened and shortened) via the time tool. Also administered pitch shifting via pitch tool and checked detection of tuning via correct pitch macro. After exporting these, they were reimported to see if detection had changed.\n\nObjective Results:\n-Upon import, vocal tempo detection was different. (One detected in 5/4, the other in 3/4, at drastically different tempos).\n-For short notes, when using the time tool to stretch, there were audible differences in results.\n-For long notes, when using the time tool to shorten, there was significantly less audible difference (subjectively: no difference)\n-For pitch detection, the algorithm detected pitch differently both audibly and visually.\n\nSubjective Opinions:\n-Time stretching yielded reduced artifacts in extreme settings when done at 192kHz. It did not eliminate all artifacts, but did reduce them.\n-When time stretching in a more nuanced way, the differences in artifacts were negligible.\n-When adjusting pitch manually, there was no audible difference in the quality of the pitch shifting at different sample rates. (For this test, everything was shifted up half an octave before any adjustments made)\n-When detecting pitch, both behaved quite differently. This was partially due to detection of select blobs being different at either sample rate. (This was most surprising to me of all the results)\n-When blobs were adjusted to match as closely as possible by hand, the tuning seemed to behave identically, including locations and levels of artifacts. (My gut says they \u201cfelt\u201d different but that is most likely either placebo or the slight differences in true blob locations)",

    "content": "1) what are the top 5 most important things for you in purchasing a drum sample pack ?\n\n\nI never purchase drum sample packs - not since having Splice. I do like a clear identity in a pack though - for instance, The Kount's sample pack has all those lo-fi/saturated kicks and snares, wonky grooves and crusty hi hats etc that sit very much in his genre, so if I'm reaching for that sound, I know exactly where to go. \n\nI don't know your drummer or his band, but I'd wonder what distinctive character you could capture in your pack? So that I know exactly where to go when I want \"that\" sound in a writing session instant. \n\n\n2) I\u2019m always annoyed that all samples are 0.0db normalized and I always have to turned them way down to keep my gain staging coherent, would I be crazy to have them peak at -8 ? Would people automatically hate it ? \n\nI produce largely in Ableton now, and when you drop a sample in the drum rack, the instance of Simpler it creates defaults to -12dB. With the velocity:volume dial at default (45%), this causes a 0dB sample to play back at -6dB when velocity=100 (the default). My template has all mixer faders (including a basic drum rack + instance of Drum Buss) trimmed to -9dB (similar to my mix gain staging strategy I detailed previously), allowing me to mash stuff up if needed, and still have headroom to not have to max out vocals when it comes to cutting them. What I'm saying in a roundabout way is... I've already made allowances for 0dB samples, so I don't care - but you probably should, because if you're selling on Splice, they could sound dwarfed against the next pack.",

    "content": "Do you guys worry a lot about Gain Staging when producing ? for example setting up the overall Saturation balance of a mix from the start. \n\nI find myself putting a simple Ableton Live device around saturation plugins ; two Utility devices mapped to the same knob so that turning it up turns up the Input and turns down the Output at the same time and vice-versa.\n\nAlso, is that something you change often depending on your chain, or do you (say for an 'analog' plugins vocal chain for subtle color) set a level at the start and just try to keep it consistent across the chain ? \n\nIn general I tend to keep it not too hot when producing so that I don't do something I'd regret later on, but I intend to get more confident in that",

Even if the gap between adoption of certain traditions is still wide, do you think we'll see that divide start to narrow more quickly now that we live in an era of wider and more immediate contact with other cultures? It feels like it's trending in that direction.\n\nYou're right about tonal systems. They're foundational properties that aren't so easily assimilated because of differences in tool set and cultural upbringing, so it's understandable that Western creators (as an example) don't have the means to implement them right as quickly.\n\nThat said, microtonal Western music (while still a niche) has a community of adopters who are building tools to open those doors to people who are interested in engaging with it. Ableton recently packaged it's DAW with the means to implement custom-tunings. Logic has had a version of this for quite some time. It's baby steps, sure, but I think it's slowly trending in a direction that's giving people the means to participate with one another.",

Trey Spruance has said on a few occasions that their seemingly arabic-sounding music would sound just as foreign to an arab musician as it would to an American listener.

For example you shift it +12 and play C1 it will take the sample from C0 and play it at double speed - changing the character of the sound sometimes drastically. If the range knob is at 50% and shift is at 0 and you play C0 it will use the sample from G0 (because it\u2019s 50% the distance from C0) and if you play C2 it will use the sample from G1 - also has interesting effects on the sound. I still haven\u2019t figured out the best way of explaining this function but I find it really usable and I\u2019ve never seen sometime implement it before.",

Also, a lot of things that have loose rhythm in a way that people tend to love often bother me and sound out of time to me. Jay-Z is a perfect example of this. I spent years thinking his rhythm was terrible before I realized he was doing a shuffle time feel where the amount his vocal is off from the snare creates the shuffle. I just didn\u2019t pick up on that for like\u2026 15 years? And just wondered why nobody else was bothered him being \u201cout of time\u201d. Kind of like when people with an undeveloped sense of harmony think of jazz as simply being an excuse for allowing wrong notes. That\u2019s how I hear people that are famous for stretching rhythm",

The amount of times that I showed something that I thought was good and was rejected, and the times I showed something I hated and got good reactions from  people. You really never know! \n\nI\u2019ve been doing more writing sessions these days (once or twice a week or so), and I\u2019m really falling in love with this because I can get out of my own head and look around to get a sense of whether an idea is working or not outside of my own opinions\n\nSpeaking of the relentless will to finish: would it be a producer\u2019s job to stay on top of getting others in team to get their parts done? If I\u2019ve done my part already and completed it, do I keep bothering them to get their parts done? (lyrics etc) \n\nI read your reply to someone asking about writing sessions, and you said your biggest goal is to get the vocals from the first spark of inspiration on that same day. I\u2019ve had sessions where I get a basic bone of ideas with beat done, and top line is done but the lyrics are recorded in Gibberish and stream of consciousness. I would return, complete the arrangement on my own - send it back, they said they fuck with it and tells me they will finish the lyrics. How long do I wait, do I follow up at all, or do I just move on and keep making more? I don\u2019t want to overstep or rush people (and.. I can\u2019t get anyone to anything of course), but I also want to get the song done while I\u2019m excited so I can keep moving forward. It\u2019s hard to tell if I can even do about it or if I should just keep it moving and leave it be",

(In important small venue in Paris, FR (hometown) friends will be there, big event he rightly envisions as a celebration for the new kick-ass song with the new kick-ass video.)\n\nBut, as close friend, band-in-question-member, sound guy and producer for the project, I think we should wait and take time to get very good vocals, while right now it feels like they're merely existing because song has to have vocals. Leaves no strong impression, or the impression that the performance lacks intention.\n\nBand rocks (his guitar included), Harmonies and Gang Vocals are cool. \nReally the lead vocal is the only thing in the way of getting the song to be really good. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel like his intuition for the release date (deadline is in 4 days) is good and could be very valuable for us.\nOn the other, I don't see why anyone would be truly excited for us if singer is mid.\n(I know he's good deep down, he's given me chills when singing with no pressure, rn we're just lacking some of that magic.)\n\nAs the song is today, you wouldn't love to listen to the song on your way to work or school, enjoying it for what it is.\n\nAnyway, right now I'm going to try and squeeze that magic out of him in the next following days when we can see each other.\nAs I'm typing this I also realize I should send him the instrumental and let him try shit alone. \n\nMaybe that's my answer.",

The advice about focusing on the meat of a note as opposed to consonant etc is brilliant also thank you . I was keeping an interest in yalls convos about the standalone , I think perhaps was it you  and @austenballard who were deep diving it ?  I also recall you I think mentioning how you can use tuning notes sharp and flat slightly  as well as timing to create tension according to how we tend to sing",

We've had to retrack vocals for nearly every song because the performance just isn't quite there yet, but we always get it where we want it in the second session. I'm noticing a pattern of him sitting with the vocal and realizing he wants to sing it differently/better, but only feels this after we've tracked it once. Today was day 1 tracking vocals on a new song and it got to the point where i realized we were going to have to try again another day, I was felt fed up. I tried to discern what exactly i was frustrated at. Part of me was frustrated because it doesnt seem like he is ever truly prepared to track vocals, in the sense of being warmed up, having ideas of how he wants to sing, practicing ahead of time, singing random stuff in between takes, etc. The other part of me was frustrated with myself because im aware some of the responsibility falls on me as the producer/coach. I have no problem taking time to edit the vocal, i know it's part of the job, i enjoy it in fact haha - but is it fair to have certain expectations from him as the artist? I want to have a conversation with him about it but also be clear that i want to be better at my job too",

It sounds like you've been getting good performances the second time around so maybe that's all that matters but it might be worth having a conversation about how the artist can come in better prepared in the future (sharing practice strategies rather than scolding).",

Odd perspective, but I think I was too helpful and because he was insecure about his thoughts, ideas, and abilities, he ended up using me as a crutch, which is partly my fault.

Or (something I really don\u2019t like, because I tend to hear it a lot more) is adjusting the gain while tracking sections.

But I think we can dig a bit deeper.\n\nI like to work in a way during tracking/production that\u2019s maybe a bit more old school with shooting for around -18dbFS on the average. It gives me a kind of fixed reference in my mind which gives me enough headroom for most dynamics. Now the important part is you have to turn up your monitoring/headphones volume to be adequately loud to work with those lower levels and then leave it there.That being said it might be necessary to bring down other pre existing tracks that are too loud.\n\nNow since the volume of the monitoring/headphones stays the same during that tracking session you can use the gain of your preamp (or the output gain of the compressor, if you\u2019re using one on the way in) to adjust the vocal or instrument so that for every part of the arrangement it feels right. So in a sense you are pre mixing during the recording, taking off some work down the line",

    "content": "My current approach to this involves a couple of principles, but this is the first that comes to mind:\n\n1. If there\u2019s a part with bg vocals performing different lines than the lead and there\u2019s a lot going on, I try to have a spot earlier in the song where the exactly lines those BGs are performing have a moment to shine. For example, if there\u2019s a low energy bridge where they can be clearly understood before the big hook where they can be perceived but not understood as well in the midst of so much. \n\nWhat this does is allow the listeners brain to process what\u2019s being said with little effort, and then later when it\u2019s in a tornado they can still perceive what it\u2019s saying because they recognize it as something their brain already knows, so it\u2019s not overwhelming for their brain to understand the words of multiple vocals going at once if there are layers of lines being performed (usually syncopated) around each other.\n\nThis applies to instruments as well, but instead of intelligibility of words I focus more on cutting frequencies so everything can fit well in the big moments. If they head a synth at full power in the intro and it comes back for a final hook, you can get away with cutting a lot of meat off of it and still have it be perceived as the same synth, without muddying the mix and also creating a nice \u2018bringing the song full circle\u2019 feeling - If the track calls for that.\n\nI typed this off the cuff based in gut instinct so not standing by this message as full proof, but this all feels right to me as I explore what I have done for tracks, without having this much thought or words to it.",

Whatever the case it feels fittingly cool and unsettling. \n\nThat was my instinct with the DI. Doesn\u2019t feel like the rolloff of an amp.",

    "content": "I've run into a weird dilemma and I'd love some advice/guidance. A pop track I'm producing on sounds great on the ears instrumentally and vocally, but I keep thinking it could have *more* going on to compliment it. Kind of like adding sprinkles onto a cake. However, I go to to explore other elements (extra vocal layers, extra synths, etc.) and it just throws this feeling of balance off. It's probably a mental barrier after listening to what the demo sounds like so much, but at the same time, I think the track could objectively benefit from some filling out.",
