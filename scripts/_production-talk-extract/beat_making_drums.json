Initial freedom and playfulness, and then a significant period in the wilderness where \u201cgetting it right\u201d or \u201cbeing professional\u201d takes over while they build their technical skills and experience\n\nSome much smaller percentage emerge from this period back into a playful lightness (while having integrated the skills). I would say less engineers than producers IME\n\nThe thing is that it really doesn\u2019t need to be that way, and it\u2019s probably my #1 motivator in posting here - to keep the focus on what matters.

Name one thing you\u2019ve ever done that\u2019s actually perfect. You\u2019re just scared to move on.\u201d  That story has stuck with me.\n\n2) I\u2019m a fairly decent guitar player, have made an actual career of being paid to do it. And I STILL am either constantly hiring people better than I or recording things note by note and then assembled in protools afterwards. Dr Luke might be the best guitarist I\u2019ve ever been around (and I\u2019ve hung with Blake Mills, Tim Pierce, Phil X), and he CONSTANTLY would just hit record, play the four chords of the song free time, and then cut them up and drop them on the ones or wherever they\u2019re supposed to go in the song. My favorite thing about making records vs performing them live is that on record NO ONE CARES how you got there, just that you did. Unless your groove has something particularly magic to offer I\u2019d get over the one take mentality pretty quick.",

In some ways our culture likes to reward artists being martyrs, but it\u2019s never something to strive for. I think as producers one of the biggest parts of our job is to be a grounding presence and a support for artists who can sometimes have pretty wild swings. But we\u2019re artists too in our own right with our own bipolar tendencies. In a way that can create an empathy bond between us\u2026we can understand the manic exuberance of making an amazing thing and how there\u2019s usually a pendulum swing in the other direction to compensate. But I kind of think our job as producers is to have our shit together enough to buffer that bipolar thing and make a sanctuary where an artist can feel at home. Just my random thought for the day.",

    "content": "I've been a \"musician\" since way before i started recording and producing stuff. (Since i was 4 i think). It's such an integral part of how music can feel and make you move. Think about how someone like Anderson paak. can make you dance by just playing 8th notes on a highhat and nothing else(see tinydesk for ref.) or Pino Paladino, will make you break your neck with his bass, playing simple Quater notes. (anything D'angelo).  Even in a genre that is as quantized and on the grid as it gets like a lot of hiphop/trap is, notice how the artist(rappers) that really stand out, are the ones that make those beats really groove/hit because of how they themselves \"groove\" or flow on those beats. They might be slightly behind or in front of the beat, or they might even swing a little. \n\nYou can really get into the micro and macro dynamics of groove. Listen to guys like Led zeppelin, how they might start out a song a few BPM slower than they finish, because of the build up of energy through out the song, and it doesn't sound wrong or unnatural. \n\nA fun thing to do, when looking for inspiration for grooves, is record some foley, and look for naturally occurring rhythms in the sample. Try and build a grove around that probably a bit wonky rhythm. It can really be an eye opening experience once you realise how much fun rhythm and groove is, when you don't have to obey the grid in a daw like a machine. \n\nBut like anything music, it's really about listening and feeling. Really internalising what a forward or laid back snare feels like or a bass thats almost a 16th behind the beat.",

But the best way is to just get more reps to get faster and better. 10,000 hours, no shortcuts.\n\nBut more actionable advice - stick to a slim number of EQ and Compressor plugs and just use those. For example 99% of my mixes just use pro q3, API-2500, and Kush AR-1. The idea being minimize variables and decisions, and use stuff you know ridiculously well.\n\nProduction side, I find having go to sounds, samples, and instruments (hardware or software) well learned and ready to go shortens the path from opening your project to creating music. For me, this is taking my free time to mess with my MPC and explore samples, or to create patches on my synths to become more intertwined with my instruments. This is separate from the actual \u201cI\u2019m gonna make a song today\u201d process.\n\nUltimately\u2026make a song in 8 hours as many days as you can.

Listen.\n\nWhen it comes to groove or feel it's common for the ensemble to not line up perfectly or even *sound* as if they line up perfectly on transients. Quite often the band are flamming against each other in a way that is tasteful. Sometimes they're dead-on for a beat and the next moment they're doing a tight flam. \n\nDon't get lost solo'ing instruments. Keep the entire song section in perspective when you tweak. If you're having trouble making choices mute a few instruments, but don't solo.\n\nAlso, fader level has a massive influence on groove. Before you start editing too hard play with your fader balances and find the groove that way. Listen to how the proportion of instruments changes the groove. It may turn out you don't need to do much, if any, micro editing.",

Together they create a single melodic voice.\n\n**2) **How do the instruments stack on each other? Do they clash? Cellos doubling a bass an octave up extend it's timbre into a higher register to make it read better. It's not so different from adding fuzz to an 808 so that it has more presence.\n\n**3) **Which instrument will cut through the music?\n\n---\n\nA few concepts that I'll add:\n\n**4) **Instruments in the foreground vs. the background. Know which part is the lead (focal point) at any given point in the record and then pare down the presence of the rest and push it into the back of the sound stage.\n\n**5)** (Piggybacking off of Felix's excellent post) What is the simplest way to achieve the desired effect? Reduce. Reduce. Reduce.\n\nCut instruments and parts ruthlessly and approach it with a minimalist's eye. Like writing a haiku: How few elements can you use to create an impression? Maybe a guitar part is carrying 90% of the groove and the drums only need to be a kick and a snare. Or maybe the guitar is covering the backbeat too, and you don't even need a snare!\n\nConstantly ask yourself \"What is the most important sensation in the record?\" and then focus it by cutting out everything that gets in the way.\n\n**6)** Hocketing. Pass the melody off between different instruments at different points in the song. Play it in different registers. Combine voices occasionally for special effect.\n\n**7)** Tonal contrast. Dark instruments plus bright instruments. Distorted and clean together. Near vs. distant.\n\nElements that sound same-y will gel together and elements that contrast tonally will pop.",

It felt evident when we were riffing on sliding scale mixing rates last month and it felt evident this morning/last night in here. I'm all in on the greyhound sentiment, I've been a grafter through and through since I was in elementary school skipping homework to double up on piano practice. I once drove 7 hours to buy a Juno-60 on Craigslist and the guy didn't answer the door; I make DUMB life decisions all centered around this non-negotiable gravity towards the art. I can promise I have whatever that obsessive brain disorder thing is that we all keep riffing about (and believe the same for the grand majority here). But can we not practice a little self preservation along the way? Nobody besides your team is really gonna stick up for you; I believe that in line with the all the professional metrics there exists the opportunity/need to set  precedents on how you want to be treated. I don't think this is something that *comes* with being a great producer, I think it's something that *contributes* to someone becoming a great producer. And of course, knowing how to ask for that fairness with a kind/patient/assertive/flexible tone is critical. But if I believe something is a little crooked in the system, I'd rather not wait till I hopefully arrive a decade later on the other side of the fence to be able to do something about it. I would rather make an attempt at being heard now and see whether it makes any progress, even if it just gives some suit on an email thread something to think about.

    "content": "@Zack Hames yeahhhh. watch the questlove video on youtube where he talks about d'angelo asking him to play crazy laid back and flammy too.\n\nmy general thought on timing is: behind the beat is more groovy and laid back (vocals, percussion, bass against the kick drum, etc) and ahead is intense and anxious (especially vocals).\n\nthere are many examples of groove being behind the beat as that's something people talk about a lot. definitely dive into that concept and play with laying different elements back off the grid.\n\nbut i LOVE talking about being ahead of the beat. purists complain that a lot of modern hip hop vocals are ahead of the beat and \"off time.\" but when it's done well it makes the tracks SO exciting. lil durk, 21 savage, gucci, etc all have this excitement in some of the songs because the vocal are ahead. \n\ni've heard the argument that these guys are just amateurish in their skill. that might be true, but their natural groove and cadence works. also listen to kendrick on \"Family Ties\" where he goes in and out of being ahead of the beat and it sounds exciting as fuck when he does.\n\nalso \"Icky Thump\" by White Stripes is a song with vocals that are entirely ahead of the beat. clearly it's deliberate as jack white is a rhythmic genius (and the doubles are perfect). it adds this anxiety to the whole song that is SO dope.",

Usually they sound punchier and less flabby with just a touch of the super low lows rolled off. Basses can move around a bit more, obviously, but I also find that usually even if you have a fundamental around or below 40 hz, the first harmonic an octave above is usually what you\u2019re actually interested in. Also it\u2019s very song/arrangement/tempo (!) dependent! A slower tempo or less busy kick pattern or song arrangement will let you get away with loads more super sub stuff. Faster patterns will just sound like flabby mush with tons of sub.",

    "content": "Test is done. Tl;dr they don't null completely. They don't even detect the same audio the same.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\nBeckley, et al. (2023) reported differences in tuning results between the plugin and standalone versions of Melodyne. This investigator undertook a test of Melodyne plugin, ARA and standalone versions to determine whether the resulting tuned audio would null.\n\n**METHODS**\n\nAll testing was performed at a sample rate of 48kHz and with .wav files at a bit depth of 32 bits. Tuning was tested using two 2-second square wave tones generated with FabFilter One in Logic Pro X. Tone #1 was generated at a constant pitch of C4 +50ct. Tone #2 was generated at a pitch of C4 with the following settings: Modulation Generator (MG) Frequency set to 4.033 Hz,  MG waveform set to value 0.500, and Frequency Modulation MG set to value 0.123. Each tone was printed on a separate channel as a Bounce-in-place (bip). The two bips were then joined into a single, 6-second, mono .wav file with 2 seconds of silence between the bips. The 6-second .wav file was copied onto two new channels in Logic Pro X, and dragged out of Logic Pro onto the desktop for use in Melodyne standalone.\n\nAudio was transferred into Melodyne: one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne non-ARA, one mono channel in Logic Pro X was loaded with an instance of Melodyne ARA, and the copy of the .wav file on the desktop was loaded into Melodyne standalone. All transfers were completed using the Melodic (Standard) algorithm. \n\nTransferred audio was quantized to pitch C4, offset 0 ct, Pitch Modulation 0.0%, Pitch Drift 0.0%. All other settings were left at defaults; Note Assignment mode was checked to verify that Playback Type in each case was 'Tonal'. \n\nResulting audio was printed and imported into three new mono channels in Logic Pro X. Null testing was performed using the phase invert feature in Logic Pro X's stock 'Gain' plugin.",

I made a record in Nashville a few years ago with engineer Mark Nevers (Bill Callahan, Bonnie Prince, Lambchop etc) and instead of using click tracks he had in his template a load of shakers, side sticks and percussion loops which he had recorded all set with Elastic Audio and Tick based processing. What this meant was he could create a shaker type click just by changing the blend between the samples and pushing the tempo up or down. It worked really well on what was an acoustic based record. The players loved it, and I swear they got master takes quicker without being bludgeoned by the normal click.  Anyone done this before? Is it a Nashville thing?",

Is it up-front or does it sink into the back? It's easy for a 4x4 to feel hackneyed or overbearing. Sometimes all you need is a gentle *pat pat pat pat* to tie things together.\n\nA fresh or unconventional texture will open up drastically different feels. People can dance to anything if it's got a 4x4 click, so it doesn't necessarily *need* to be a kick. You can go far using samples and percussion that sit in different registers, but play the same role.\n\n3) **Complimentary instruments**. If the kick is the \"rock\" then the groove is going to come from how everything else swings over that. What's the friction like between the kick and the other elements? If the kick is a \"straight man\", then the other elements pushing off of it are where the magic comes from.",

The samples were all shakers and pleasant sounding percussion. It was way more musical than getting pummeled by the worlds crispest woodblock on the quarter-note pulse.\n\nHe said he'd developed it after doing a lot of slow doom-y metal records that grind along at ultra-slow tempos and where the players are playing very spacious but angular rhythmic parts that needed to come in on the \"+ e\" of beat 3 after a 4 bar rest. Stuff like that. Having 1/16t subdivisions alongside the 1/4 pulse was really helpful for the players to come in strong when they needed to catch a really tough entrance.",

Would people automatically hate it ? \n3) In acoustic drum packs, how interested would you be about having the mixed loop but always the stems from that loop (separate mics, or at least kick, snare, kit etc\u2026)\n4) how important is it for there to be pre-made battery/drum rack/kontakt instruments of the library or are straight wav files cool ?\n5) what is the sample rate standard for sample librairies ?",

It's perfectly capable of making great drums.\n\nA pre-made drum loop will usually be more polished and ready-to-go than making your own drum pattern from individual samples. The pre-made loop will likely have been EQ'd, compressed, and mixed to work harmoniously, whereas if you're building a loop from scratch using samples it is up to you to polish and sculpt the sounds so that they work well together.\n\nIf the pre-made drum loop is like having someone serve you a finished meal, building the drum part from scratch means you have to learn to \"cook\" using those ingredients. It'll be harder to do well at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll be able to be more expressive.",

    "content": "Sooo, on the recording side of things: if you\u2019re going DI, most interfaces do not have a high enough input impedance to do passive pickups justice, especially if you want a decent amount of low end. Guitar pickups sound good with 1-2MOhm(the input impedance of a good tube amp), but if I want really clear modern low end that can compete with 808s, then I\u2019ve had the best results with around 10MOhm on passive bass pickups. Another important thing is a transistor-based active DI will not get you a full low end. You will end up re-amping or using amp emulations etc. Octal tubes(the type of tubes IN the B15) will. Octal tubes have a lot more body(think U47, for example) and will get you there much much quicker. I have a Sarno V8, which isn\u2019t perfect, but sounds clean, \u201cfinished\u201d and modern from the get-go. No compression or emulations needed. It\u2019s also comparatively affordable, so totally worth every penny.",

This will get you the results, but groove is a never ending journey of learning. Editing groove to make it feel the way you want to feel takes an understanding of what makes things groove one way or the other. It can be accents, dynamics, lengths of the notes, how much you deviate from the grid or what subdivisions you're on, and how the timing offsets rub and interact with each other in the whole instrumentation. Some drummers have really solid quintuplet swing, so instead of doing tripplet swing they'll play on the downbeat and the 3rd or 4th note of quintuplet. For this you can listen to guys like Nate Smith, he plays swings differently live than recordings- he drags and pushes the kicks and snares in recordings but for live, he only swings hats so there's more steady groove for other musicians to grab onto. \n\nOn the other hand, for playing the grooves yourself- I find it helpful to dance and groove to the rhythms as much as I can to absorb the feel and internalize them. But in order to play ahead or behind with authority, you need to know where the grids are and metronome practice is crucial. I'm not that great at timing either, so I'm trying to do as much reps in with metronomes as I can. Learning to play on the grid is a first step before learning how to deviate with clear intention. I hope this helps!",

    "content": "Logic Gang: quick share, Im finding the sample delay tool v useful in a few ways and reccommend for a few reasons. Picking up on the midi ticks convo last week, if youre programming in Logic , instead of dragging (and losing track of your moves) in the timeline/piano roll....throw one of these on an insert and increase the delay in tiny increments as you run down the track (typically hats and offbeat/ghost snares first) . You can quickly create the pocket youre looking for . Also added bonus...I believe under c. 12ms most people arent hearing a glaring time shift , (i dont go above 2ms ) so the delay is handy again just putting your hats , snares, percussive elements....just a millisecond or two behind/in front of each other so all your transient sounds are not hitting the 1/4,1/8, 16th counts at precisely the same instant. I find this helps with transients. Lastly, unlink the left and right on a stereo channel and youve got an instant width tool. Best for the transient and groove use tho imo.",

If I'm using a loop it's because I want a vibe to happen instantly. Any edits I make on the loop will have to be done across the mics anyway, and hopefully you'll have mixed the loop in such a way that rocks the intention of the part being played. I can see instances where having control over close mics / overheads/ rooms might be cool though.\n\n\n4) how important is it for there to be pre-made battery/drum rack/kontakt instruments of the library or are straight wav files cool ?\n\nWould definitely like this.\n\n\n\n5) what is the sample rate standard for sample librairies ?\n\n\nDunno, but I'd like to see 24/44 or 48, and I can't imagine why you'd go below this.",

From a production/mix viewpoint....i suppose these sounds themselves hit with such a charcter in the right frequencies that there must be something intrinsically appealing to us that will keep them forever relevant.Im diving back into the Linndrum Clap and the old Jermain Dupri / So So Def claps at the mo for a little diff sonic character .....they are all still in the same ilk as the rolands though. \n\nre: the drill hats.....thats another cyclical pattern there. In the uk thats been appearing and reforming for decades now. its a soca pattern that the uk appropriated into a period of uk garage production (about the same time that 2 step began to mutate into the hip-hop influenced So Solid style )......and then dipped into a scene we had follwing called UkFunky ( a mix of Us House and Carribean influenced drum patterns and bass) .

Analog gear hasn't really progressed much and a pultec/Neve EQ is still one of the best EQs ever for instance. Those records still sound great for that reason. As for punk and hardcore it's interesting: do people genuinely still listen to those records? I've revisited a few old punk records which I used to think were amazing. The songs are great but the listening experience just isn't enjoyable for me anymore, in part due to messy playing  and bad recording/mixing. With bad I mean the playing distracts from the groove of the band and the mixing distracts from the song, where it does not support the dynamic shifts",

    "content": "As a practical example of when not being in phase is the right move:\n\nJon Castelli did a live mix on Twitch on Wednesday that included live drums. He identified that one of the snare mics sounded fuller when he inverted the polarity and proceeded to mix with that. \n\nLater in that session when it came time for notes, the producer (who was present in the room) asked why the snare had lost a certain thin and \"woody\" character that they liked. Jon reverted the snare mic to it's original polarity and the producer went \"Ahh! There it is.\"\n\nSo the takeaway here is that while drums usually *do* sing the best and hit the hardest when they're all working in phase with one another, sometimes the creative intention overrides the need to align them in a way that makes them most \"full\".\n\nAs you say: If it sounds good, it is good.",

And I hardly ever let the down beats of transitions be off grid too. I usually want the sections to be obvious. I also start with going behind the beat first. I have also recently in the last year or so found that if I start with getting the very basic part of the groove right first, I am less likely to overcrowd my production. So before I put hats in, I\u2019ll just put in snare and kick and try and find the groove with just those 2 elements (unless there is some other clear rhythmic element at play) but I feel like if you can\u2019t feel the groove with just the kick and (snare/clap/perc) then it\u2019s not there.",

Try something new.\n\nIt's up to either the artist or you, as the producer, to have a vision for what the song is, where it's going, and what it needs. One of you have to have a roadmap. *Someone* needs to have the vision. To be the leader. To steer the ship.\n\nIf the vision is not clear then perhaps the song itself needs to be refined some more until it has a strong identity. That will be your north star for creative decisions. \n\nIf you can convey the essence of the song to your players, the emotion behind it, then they can interpret that feeling in a way that is uniquely them without the need for you to dictate their parts. If you can give them an emotion and maybe some general contour of what you're hearing then they can fill in the spaces and bring their own qualities.\n\nAs producer, part of your job is curating the talent that you recruit to realize your vision. If you know what the song needs you can confidently pick a player with complimentary sensibilities. If you can pick the right person then very often most of the work is done by virtue of them being aligned with the song. Each of their contributions and ideas are likely to be excellent.\n\n----",

Just chords, melody, and lyric. *Maybe* a kick drum pattern. Lead sheet style.\n\nIf the song is good then it will still be compelling. The best songs tend to be very robust and can be played a dozen different ways because they are fundamentally compelling. If the demo doesn't feel good this way then the song may need more work.\n\nLesser songs will depend on the arrangement or production to be compelling, or only work in a narrow band of styles. Sometimes a song can only work one way. It's okay if this is the case for your song, but then it's up to you to present the demo with the arrangement or elements that are essential to make the song compelling, and that will close off more and more of the instrumental possibilities.\n\nSo if you want to increase the chances of a session player delivering an unexpected, brilliant, idea then set them up for success with a strong song that can be interpreted many ways.\n\n----",

I hate it when samples peak at 0. I actually turn all of them down when I put them into a sampler to make it peak at -8 to -12\n\n3) small snippets of hihats or snare ghost notes and some tom loops. I\u2019d probably prefer them mixed only\n\n4) for kits I think it is important. Round robin and velocity layers, and if you are doing rooms or separate mics having a kit makes an instantly playable and tweakable kit.\n\n5) I\u2019m not sure. Anything between 44.1/16 and 48/24 should be fine! Anything beyond might be too much",

As in, if you use a hi-hat loop in your track, you can't have a section that is JUST the hi-hat loop. That would also apply to delivering stems. Your \"percussion\" stem, for instance, should have other elements baked in with it.\n\nThat doesn't apply in all cases and there are certain samples out there that don't allow for sync use. I can't remember which ones offhand, but that's why it's worth checking the license agreement.",

One of my favorite beats of all time is Fleetwood Mac's \"Hypnotized\" which is a swingy, triplet unchanging thing that is effectively a drum loop through the song, except Mick Fleetwood plays it. I recreated it using a sample pack of Mick Fleetwood's and turned it into a song after serious finagling, especially in the context of grid music. The insight into accent, velocity, swing, where in the grid things hit (or don't), which specific hits matter and how dropping just one or two key hits in a repetitive pattern can shift the groove entirely. It also tests your chops for figuring out choke groups, how to make closed and open hi hats sound \"real\" (if that's your goal) so on and so forth. I also love recreating a beat as a way in when musical inspiration may be lacking.",

I'll play with forward swing and dragging notes a lot if I'm going for a more real/dynamic feel when programming. keeping in mind that if the goal is trying to stay \"on time\" any fwd swing that might happen at the start of a phrase will be compensated with some drag  after or vice versa.  keeping velocities in mind w drum hits + linking it to a filter env so that harder hits have more high end and softer hits end up a bit rounder.\n\nadding subtle layers that are similar   to the main drums but occupy a different texture or tone  in dif  sections to thicken up the groove or automate the attack /sustain of certain elements thru diff sections to help shift the listener  focus throughout",

    "content": "I use both AD and SD.  \n\nAD was easier for me to learn and jump into, but I'd say it's also a little more limited in how realistic you can get depending on the ADpaks you have.  Great for getting something in quickly, and I still use it quite a bit.\n\nSD definitely had a learning curve for me but DAMN you can go deep if you really want to tweak out on drum programming.  There are tons of articulations, tons of microphones, and the expansions are all super in depth as well so you can shop around and figure out what is best.  It's definitely at a premium though for price, and I don't reach for it as often if I'm trying to get an idea out quickly, but I just used it today to play in some hihats because it sounds closer to real to my ears than AD.\n\nThe other thing I'd add about SD is the install size is pretty massive.  I have the core library with all the mics installed and their EZX kick and snares library and it's taking 250GB on one of my externals.  Oh by the way you can use any EZ Drummer libraries in SD which are more similar in depth to Addictive Drums stuff and they put out a few new libraries a year.",

    "content": "(Ok. Now I'm starting to run with this train of thought. Now would be a good time to step off if you've gotten what you need.)\n\nI don't want this to sound like the end-all be-all. One of my absolute favorites is James Brown, and there is no way that some of his songs would hold up to the level of scrutiny I'm describing. And those records *kill*. It's all vibe. It's vibe all the way down, bebe. Not a chord change in sight. Barely a melody in some cases. And that's alright.\n\nSo what did James do? More often than not James would get all of his band (real jazz killers) in the studio and he would sing the parts to them one by one and allow them to input their own feel.\n\nHe'd start with the drummer and have them play a pattern that James was feeling. Once the drummer was jamming on that he would move on to the bass player and sing them an idea. Once the bass player had that germ of an idea they would continue to jam on it with the drummer, refining and adding their own thing. Then James would move on to the horns, and so on, and so on.\n\nWhile James could be dictatorial and (from the perspective of music education) the least technically qualified person in the room he had *vision*. \n\nIf the song has a strong identity you can give your players a good (non-technical) prompt and they can interpret that through their own sensibilities. You can describe a mood, or a scene, or an abstract sensation.\n\nR. Kelly once said (I'm paraphrasing): \"RnB is supposed to feel like the best moment of your *life*.\" That simple description conveys so much about the feel, the pleasure, and the joy that he is looking for in his music. It also excludes a lot of possibilities as well. If you can give your players a prompt like *that* then you can get everyone aligned on the same wavelength and it will carry you so much further without the need to dictate parts.\n\n----",

    "content": "Playing it or you can take a drum loop with groove you like and map out a groove template. Playing it is much faster and more feel, but often times it will need editing unless you have great timing. If it\u2019s something loose then I\u2019d definitely go ahead and move each notes because quantizing even 50% is going to change the feel. This is real nerdy but when there\u2019s a really good moment in groove, I use logic\u2019s event editor to look at how many ticks they are off by and snap other notes to somewhere near. For example, if I liked the feel of it being 40 ticks late then I\u2019m gonna move everything (or some select notes that are in the same spot of the groove cycle) to somewhere nearby. Ticks are tempo relative so 50 ticks in 90bpm is different than 50 ticks in 120bpm. But it\u2019s still in same relative timeline, but it\u2019s going to feel different in different tempos. \n\nIf you want it to groove like a drummer played it, best thing to do is play it in. You might end up quantizing or fixing velocity to al 127 later, but it\u2019s going to be better than clicked in sequence if that is the style. Clicked in sequenced drums is its own groove too, you don\u2019t want them having looseness so you quantize them all to 0 but you can still mess around with nudging them to be a bit behind or ahead of the grid.",

    "content": "1) what are the top 5 most important things for you in purchasing a drum sample pack ?\n\n\nI never purchase drum sample packs - not since having Splice. I do like a clear identity in a pack though - for instance, The Kount's sample pack has all those lo-fi/saturated kicks and snares, wonky grooves and crusty hi hats etc that sit very much in his genre, so if I'm reaching for that sound, I know exactly where to go. \n\nI don't know your drummer or his band, but I'd wonder what distinctive character you could capture in your pack? So that I know exactly where to go when I want \"that\" sound in a writing session instant. \n\n\n2) I\u2019m always annoyed that all samples are 0.0db normalized and I always have to turned them way down to keep my gain staging coherent, would I be crazy to have them peak at -8 ? Would people automatically hate it ? \n\nI produce largely in Ableton now, and when you drop a sample in the drum rack, the instance of Simpler it creates defaults to -12dB. With the velocity:volume dial at default (45%), this causes a 0dB sample to play back at -6dB when velocity=100 (the default). My template has all mixer faders (including a basic drum rack + instance of Drum Buss) trimmed to -9dB (similar to my mix gain staging strategy I detailed previously), allowing me to mash stuff up if needed, and still have headroom to not have to max out vocals when it comes to cutting them. What I'm saying in a roundabout way is... I've already made allowances for 0dB samples, so I don't care - but you probably should, because if you're selling on Splice, they could sound dwarfed against the next pack.",

My reasons were much like yours; to get away from software and have a standalone instrument to play with.\n\nI don't have many bad things to say about it, but ultimately it just wasn't a good fit for the way my brain works. NI have crammed a tremendous amount of features and functions into that thing. Most of which it does very well, but when it came time to do sequencing in the unit the interface was just too much of a hurdle for me. I found it hard to keep all of the key commands in my head to do simple commands. I think it's a little *too* efficient in how many options they've fit into it. Remembering the commands among it's unorthodox button layout was challenging and unintuitive for me.\n\nAs you might imagine, it integrates perfectly with the Maschine software, which is basically a DAW within a plugin that controls the hardware and vice-versa if you choose to use a computer. But I wasn't interested in that, because I can achieve the same things and more with plain old Ableton.\n\nIt *does* have a fantastic sample library and the NI sample packs you can purchase are very well done.",

This means if I play something, I'm going to need to be quantizing audio and I'm relying on the visual aid of the waveform because my inherent sense of groove is pretty weak. So I'm looking for advice on quick heuristics for quantizing audio. \n\nTodays example: I played some palm muted acoustic guitars, I've marked the scrape of the pick in red and the peak of the waveform where the note truly starts ringing in green. The waveform actually starts a little before the scrape as you can see where the pick touches the string wave over on the left . How are y'all thinking about which part of this waveform should fall on which side of the beat?",

    "content": "it\u2019s generally the orange if it\u2019s something like palm muted guitars. But always listen and feel it. It can feel better to be early in certain styles but it can feel better to be late on other styles. it also depends on who else is doing what\n\nBut groove template is always there if you wanna line it up with other instruments. bounce and make the source and destination audio files the same length, make sure the markers are in the correct place then sync them up. \n\nI\u2019m 90% manual editing though. Because aligning automatically can fix notes I didn\u2019t want to fix. you can also go measure by measure to be more careful if you want to auto align with groove templates \n\nyou want to ask yourself \u201cis this note late or early?\u201d before making any moves. I like nudging with keyboard so I can fine tune how far it goes. \n\nNowadays I\u2019m more committed to \u201cthe only way to make the groove feel good is to play it that way\u201d. I hate having to edit and to be honest, nothing beats well played rhythm section\u2026 Especially because I do a lot of in between the groove stuff, 30% quantization can mess with the feel of well landed notes. So I\u2019m doing a lot of metronome practice these days",

Also, a lot of things that have loose rhythm in a way that people tend to love often bother me and sound out of time to me. Jay-Z is a perfect example of this. I spent years thinking his rhythm was terrible before I realized he was doing a shuffle time feel where the amount his vocal is off from the snare creates the shuffle. I just didn\u2019t pick up on that for like\u2026 15 years? And just wondered why nobody else was bothered him being \u201cout of time\u201d. Kind of like when people with an undeveloped sense of harmony think of jazz as simply being an excuse for allowing wrong notes. That\u2019s how I hear people that are famous for stretching rhythm",

I was in a huge J-Dilla phase for a while and I would try basically play things off for the feels. But it would sound like a mistake as opposed to intentional feel. and that was because I haven\u2019t really mastered being right on the grid yet. I\u2019m still working on being right on the grid by playing with metronome, and I found that actually improved my feel for all kinds of styles of groove. I still need to work on it, but it\u2019s definitely better than before and I need less takes now. \n\nI know your question was about editing but I think there\u2019s no better way to improve the sense of time and feel than to grab instruments and learn being what on time/late or early feels like.",

As part of my thesis I'm looking to analyse songs of both eras to showcase if and how they are similar. \nAnyone got recommendations for literature that might help with the analysis of songs in that regard.

He tinkers with parts on his own in Logic against the rough and he added a great part with a Logic instrument that is good...but it has a very specific effect that I'd like to recreate in Ableton. Anybody have any thoughts on how to get this rhythmic gating effect using Ableton effects or know of a plugin that makes this trivial? I've included a sample of the audio, a screenshot of the Logic patch and a screenshot of the very straightforward MIDI from which it is derived. (Worse comes to worse we can use an export of the audio, but would like to see if I can crack it for maximum flexibility).\n\nI tried fucking with Beat Repeat and it's close, but not quite the same. Anybody have any bright ideas?",

We've had to retrack vocals for nearly every song because the performance just isn't quite there yet, but we always get it where we want it in the second session. I'm noticing a pattern of him sitting with the vocal and realizing he wants to sing it differently/better, but only feels this after we've tracked it once. Today was day 1 tracking vocals on a new song and it got to the point where i realized we were going to have to try again another day, I was felt fed up. I tried to discern what exactly i was frustrated at. Part of me was frustrated because it doesnt seem like he is ever truly prepared to track vocals, in the sense of being warmed up, having ideas of how he wants to sing, practicing ahead of time, singing random stuff in between takes, etc. The other part of me was frustrated with myself because im aware some of the responsibility falls on me as the producer/coach. I have no problem taking time to edit the vocal, i know it's part of the job, i enjoy it in fact haha - but is it fair to have certain expectations from him as the artist? I want to have a conversation with him about it but also be clear that i want to be better at my job too",
