I heard a great story of someone telling (I want to say) Richard Marx that he hadn\u2019t released his record yet cause he\u2019s a perfectionist and RM replied \u201cBullshit. Name one thing you\u2019ve ever done that\u2019s actually perfect. You\u2019re just scared to move on.\u201d  That story has stuck with me.\n\n2) I\u2019m a fairly decent guitar player, have made an actual career of being paid to do it. And I STILL am either constantly hiring people better than I or recording things note by note and then assembled in protools afterwards. Dr Luke might be the best guitarist I\u2019ve ever been around (and I\u2019ve hung with Blake Mills, Tim Pierce, Phil X), and he CONSTANTLY would just hit record, play the four chords of the song free time, and then cut them up and drop them on the ones or wherever they\u2019re supposed to go in the song. My favorite thing about making records vs performing them live is that on record NO ONE CARES how you got there, just that you did. Unless your groove has something particularly magic to offer I\u2019d get over the one take mentality pretty quick.",

Everybody knows what to expect and what is to be expected. \n\nProfessionalism. The room is clean, mics are up, lighting is right, session is loaded. \n\nIntuition. All the artistic/personal things. Making the artist feel safe enough to be dangerous, knowing how hard you can push them to get a take, knowing where the line is between their vision and yours, etc\u2026\n\nSonics. I want my artists to feel expensive when they\u2019re recording, so getting the mic and cue mix right is everything. \n\nSpeed. A comp up by the time they\u2019re done tracking, a quick shine to make it feel special, and a bounce for them to take with them.\n\nEverything else is on a per session basis. I can deliver a fully mixed/tuned vocal and everything in between, so it all depends on communication ahead of time.",

Whether it's a drum fill, or a chord voicing that walks up/down into the next section, or tension in the melodic voices, or shortening the notes lengths (staccato, staccatissimo).\n\nThere's also idiomatic noises from the instruments. Guitars have string scrapes, headstock rakes, that cool chattering thing from tapping near the bridge with the edge of your pick. Pianos have big glisses, horns can squeal, bowed strings can sweep a fast legato scale up into the downbeat or do a large gliss.\n\nThen there's foley. I get a *lot* of mileage from sound libraries made for film audio. Foley artists are some creative people and you can go far layering their sounds into instruments at the transitions.",

    "content": "I will say this, on the topic of standing up for yourself -- I've seen a couple times in these threads now a general sentiment of accepting that people are gonna kick you around. It felt evident when we were riffing on sliding scale mixing rates last month and it felt evident this morning/last night in here. I'm all in on the greyhound sentiment, I've been a grafter through and through since I was in elementary school skipping homework to double up on piano practice. I once drove 7 hours to buy a Juno-60 on Craigslist and the guy didn't answer the door; I make DUMB life decisions all centered around this non-negotiable gravity towards the art. I can promise I have whatever that obsessive brain disorder thing is that we all keep riffing about (and believe the same for the grand majority here). But can we not practice a little self preservation along the way? Nobody besides your team is really gonna stick up for you; I believe that in line with the all the professional metrics there exists the opportunity/need to set  precedents on how you want to be treated. I don't think this is something that *comes* with being a great producer, I think it's something that *contributes* to someone becoming a great producer. And of course, knowing how to ask for that fairness with a kind/patient/assertive/flexible tone is critical. But if I believe something is a little crooked in the system, I'd rather not wait till I hopefully arrive a decade later on the other side of the fence to be able to do something about it. I would rather make an attempt at being heard now and see whether it makes any progress, even if it just gives some suit on an email thread something to think about. It's not for the sake of my own ego, it's for the sake of our entire breed.",

For intervals other than a 5th, it's not an octave below but some other pitch, and so yeah, you're likely creating unpleasant harmonics outside of the key.\n\nThe dumbest, but easiest way to avoid that is to let the bass be the inversion's lowest note while the plays a 5th from the root note. Otherwise, you're looking at dialing back the distortion on those inversions, or on the tone as a whole, which isn't necessarily what's desired.",

    "content": "Wow. I'm making my way slowly through this Lanois/Beato interview and am amazed by what Lanois is describing from @ 52:24 to 53:45 regarding his approach to stacking modulations and special effects.\n\nAs he describes it, he's performing and printing his modulation effects (delay, verb, vibrato, pitch shifting, etc) one generation at a time as he iterates through the song. This allows him to fine-tune and perform the modulations on each successive pass so that every moment is honed and responsive enough that it becomes a part within the music, and not just a blanket effects chain.\n\nSo if he's doing pitch-shifted delays, he'll do a pass that goes up a fifth on certain notes and then layer another pass that modulates by a different interval at a select moment instead of leaving everything on throughout the entire section. He's honing each effect in sequence. It shows a tremendous care and sensitivity to the music that he would go through and *perform* each layer with so much intention.\n\nThis feels like a revelation to me and I can't wait to practice this.\n\n(I've cued up the video where they start talking about it)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxP9kKzbCFA&t=3144s",

And I was horrified cause my bass was sounding nowhere near as good and I knew the other player had the same type of bass.

    "content": "One tip I'd give is to make your patch while you have a MIDI sequence playing. Not just some static, even arpeggio that you drew in, but a part that has different articulations, note lengths, velocities, and covers a range of notes.\n\nIt's easy when making a patch to just keep your finger on one key and go *doot doot doot* (tweak) *doot doot doot* (tweak again). What you can end up doing this way is optimizing the patch and parameters for a single note or handful of notes. And it gets old to listen to. By keeping the entire musical part playing you're going to move through building a well-balanced patch much quicker.\n\nIf you have a part in mind, record the MIDI with your starter/init patch, spend some time tweaking the patch while the sequence plays, and then once you get into the ballpark replay the MIDI part using your new patch. The new synth settings will influence your articulation and feel when you record the second time around. Then refine your patch as needed. Rinse and repeat until you're satisfied.",

It doesn't sound like they're playing chords, so much as stacked oscillators.\n\nAs others mentioned, a Prophet is a good place to start, but it's not going to get you that heavy-grit saturation by itself that we hear on this record. Prophets don't get that dirty on their own. Maybe the Prophet X's with DSP effects will. I haven't used them.\n\nSomething like a Moog synth is going to lean heavier into the saturation capabilities. That record feels much more like a Moog filter.

I think a lot of what Taylor Skye is doing is taking sounds and then warping them/distorting them to shit using all of the \"wrong\" methods, and then just judging what comes out and deciding if it should be kept. I think there's a good hint of this in the lead sound at the start, where it's really out of rhythm and grainy, some notes seem to sort of \"break\" which reminds me of the results you get when you try to formant shift a verbed-out or polyphonic sound with little alterboy, or even abusing izotope RX on something that doesn't really need it (also, the RX de-reverb can do wild things to a sound you've put reverb on higher in the chain). Logic, which is what he uses, also has a lesser known formant shift that you can only get to by turning on flex pitch then adjusting in the side info bar, which can really take sounds into space. I haven't done this with melodyne, but I imagine there are some similar features.",

Acknowledgement of skill. Making things seem effortless was the ideal.\n\nContemporary listeners seem to connect more with the struggle. They want to hear the grit in the vocal, the player at the edge of their ability (whatever it may be) holding on for dear life. The mix at the edge of distortion. In that breaking point, there is a lot of beauty and emotion that would have traditionally been considered bad form. Uncouth, even!",

And then you can learn with arturia DX7 in conjunction with how the different configuration work. +FM8 has patch morphing function which can be VERY useful when it comes to FM sounds. Another cool thing about FM8 is that it shows you all of the sidebands. \n\nFrom here, it\u2019s all experimentation\n\nThat\u2019s really all you need, FM looks intimidating but it\u2019s really not that difficult. \n\n\nlinear FM is essentially really fast vibrato. Non linear FM is a fast trill between the two frequencies. AM is essentially fast *unipolar* tremolo, RM is fast *bipolar: meaning it shifts polarity too* tremolo. they all create sonic characters by creating sidebands. \n\none thing to keep in mind is most FM synths are actually not FM. it\u2019s actually imitated by doing phase modulation- but results are almost identical. except in actual FM, you get more of the carrier frequency. So FM with a high-pass filtered modulator is essentially the same as PM with a low pass filtered modulator\n\n\nrun down on difference in sidebands between the most common audio-rate modulated synthesis:\n\nFM/PM creates equally spaced sidebands\n\nRM only produces sidebands (carrier frequency + modulator frequency & carrier frequency- modulator frequency)\n\nAM is carrier with side bands of c+m and c-m",

Just chords, melody, and lyric. *Maybe* a kick drum pattern. Lead sheet style.\n\nIf the song is good then it will still be compelling. The best songs tend to be very robust and can be played a dozen different ways because they are fundamentally compelling. If the demo doesn't feel good this way then the song may need more work.\n\nLesser songs will depend on the arrangement or production to be compelling, or only work in a narrow band of styles. Sometimes a song can only work one way. It's okay if this is the case for your song, but then it's up to you to present the demo with the arrangement or elements that are essential to make the song compelling, and that will close off more and more of the instrumental possibilities.\n\nSo if you want to increase the chances of a session player delivering an unexpected, brilliant, idea then set them up for success with a strong song that can be interpreted many ways.\n\n----",

One of my favorite beats of all time is Fleetwood Mac's \"Hypnotized\" which is a swingy, triplet unchanging thing that is effectively a drum loop through the song, except Mick Fleetwood plays it. I recreated it using a sample pack of Mick Fleetwood's and turned it into a song after serious finagling, especially in the context of grid music. The insight into accent, velocity, swing, where in the grid things hit (or don't), which specific hits matter and how dropping just one or two key hits in a repetitive pattern can shift the groove entirely. It also tests your chops for figuring out choke groups, how to make closed and open hi hats sound \"real\" (if that's your goal) so on and so forth. I also love recreating a beat as a way in when musical inspiration may be lacking.",

A lot of physical modeling is heavily based on delay lines, so I\u2019d start there. Modal synthesis is also another cool concept where you would feed an impulse sample into a bank of parallel bandpass filters (very narrow q- which is also constructed with delay lines fundamentally). The idea is feedback and resonance from the filters would emulate acoustic modes. \n\nYou can emulate this with fairly cheap stuff like leap motion, I\u2019ve done a different project (something much simpler) with leap motion for gesture controlled music concr\u00e8te.

    "content": "(Ok. Now I'm starting to run with this train of thought. Now would be a good time to step off if you've gotten what you need.)\n\nI don't want this to sound like the end-all be-all. One of my absolute favorites is James Brown, and there is no way that some of his songs would hold up to the level of scrutiny I'm describing. And those records *kill*. It's all vibe. It's vibe all the way down, bebe. Not a chord change in sight. Barely a melody in some cases. And that's alright.\n\nSo what did James do? More often than not James would get all of his band (real jazz killers) in the studio and he would sing the parts to them one by one and allow them to input their own feel.\n\nHe'd start with the drummer and have them play a pattern that James was feeling. Once the drummer was jamming on that he would move on to the bass player and sing them an idea. Once the bass player had that germ of an idea they would continue to jam on it with the drummer, refining and adding their own thing. Then James would move on to the horns, and so on, and so on.\n\nWhile James could be dictatorial and (from the perspective of music education) the least technically qualified person in the room he had *vision*. \n\nIf the song has a strong identity you can give your players a good (non-technical) prompt and they can interpret that through their own sensibilities. You can describe a mood, or a scene, or an abstract sensation.\n\nR. Kelly once said (I'm paraphrasing): \"RnB is supposed to feel like the best moment of your *life*.\" That simple description conveys so much about the feel, the pleasure, and the joy that he is looking for in his music. It also excludes a lot of possibilities as well. If you can give your players a prompt like *that* then you can get everyone aligned on the same wavelength and it will carry you so much further without the need to dictate parts.\n\n----",

And it doesn't hurt that they're a \"classic\" sound, so having one around wouldn't be a bad investment and will likely see a lot of use over the years.\n\nThe last generation of Moog synths (from Sub37 onward) have been very gritty and have a lot of options for drive and feedback, which allows them to get very rough, in contrast to the Dave Smith synths which tend to be cleaner, buzzy, and articulate. These days Moogs are very warm, thick, and gritty. They're extremely easy on the ears, even when you're cranking the drive. The core components of Moog sound *really* good and there's a lot of care that's gone into the raw sound of these things. Namely the oscillators and the filter circuit. They are *very* well designed instruments. In fact, I'd say that they're *beautiful* instruments.\n\nMy recommendation for someone who's not super-deep into synthesis but wants to own a Moog would be to buy a *Subsequent 37*. It's got digitally recallable presets, whereas *Matriarch* and *Grandmother* are semi-modular and have little/no preset capability. The Subsequent 37 is plug and play, has a great set of unique features, wonderful grit, and is very fun to play.\n\nKeep in mind that the *Subsequent 37* is a monophonic synth. Technically it's paraphonic (can play up to *two* notes at a time), but you're not going to be playing any chords on it like on your Prophet.",

    "content": "hey all, if this has been answered, point me the right direction. lurked for awhile, never posted. big fan tho. earlier this year I moved all my production over to Ableton from ProTools after like a decade and it's been amazing. still using PT for all the things it's better at, but now that I have key commands more nailed down in Ableton, been super happy producing there. so fast... but I need a little help with file management. coming from PT, the last bounce location is always recalled per session, so when you reopen a session, bounces go to the last designated location. with Ableton, the last bounce location seems to recall to wherever you last bounced in general... not by project. wondering what the best workaround for this is when bouncing many versions of a number of songs - i.e. I have six songs I'm working on, and bouncing versions for dubs, some stems, and roughs for the client. I would love to not manually select the bouces folder I have created per project, as it's a lot of menu diving.. I can't seem to find a bounce location settings in preferences.. so figured I would ask the ableton wizards here. or is it best to just create a master bounces folder per EP or record and add to it as I go? kind of annoying if so, but I have learned enough workflow changes, I can adopt something like that.",

The idea is that samples often have some boxiness or ringing that needs to be EQ'd out, but those problem-zones shift when the sample is transposed up and down, making any post-sampler EQ moves ineffectual.\n\nIf you could streamline the process of re-recording a static sample with the necessary EQ cuts committed into the one-shot then those cuts would be transposed along with the sample when you play it up and down the keyboard.",

My reasons were much like yours; to get away from software and have a standalone instrument to play with.\n\nI don't have many bad things to say about it, but ultimately it just wasn't a good fit for the way my brain works. NI have crammed a tremendous amount of features and functions into that thing. Most of which it does very well, but when it came time to do sequencing in the unit the interface was just too much of a hurdle for me. I found it hard to keep all of the key commands in my head to do simple commands. I think it's a little *too* efficient in how many options they've fit into it. Remembering the commands among it's unorthodox button layout was challenging and unintuitive for me.\n\nAs you might imagine, it integrates perfectly with the Maschine software, which is basically a DAW within a plugin that controls the hardware and vice-versa if you choose to use a computer. But I wasn't interested in that, because I can achieve the same things and more with plain old Ableton.\n\nIt *does* have a fantastic sample library and the NI sample packs you can purchase are very well done.",

If you want an ensemble sound plus some major grit and close-miking I *do* like the *Bernard Hermann* orchestral library from Spitfire.\n\nFor solo strings the *NI Cremona Quartet* instruments are really, really nice. They're a pleasure to play with and sound fantastic. These have maximum presence too, so you can get some very direct sounds with them. I'm really enjoying them. The articulation and tonal options are extremely thorough.\n\nA while back a few people recommended *Sunset Strings* by Realitone. While I haven't used it yet, they look very promising.

But if I draw a MIDI note with a whole-note duration the synthesizer would modulate it's envelope time and that same sweep would descend over the course of a whole-note.\n\nThe synth would have to read upcoming MIDI note lengths from the the piano roll and modulate it's parameters on a note by note basis by reading the note duration before the note-on message. There would have to be some sort of communication between the synth and the DAW, and of course it would not work in real time.",

    "content": "If you learn how diatonic chords work it can take you far. Every key has what are called it's diatonic chords. These are chords that are made from the notes in your major or minor scale.\n\n**For example:** In the key of F, your diatonic chords are these:\n\nF, Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, E dim.\n\nYou can play any of those chords and they'll fit right in. Those are your \"can't lose\" chords that will sound coherent no matter what. I would start here by chaining some of these chords together and seeing how they sound. They're like words in a sentence that you can rearrange to say different things.",

    "content": "Sort of, yes. But you don't need to take a chunk out of the middle of the note. The slowest way to do it (and the easiest for me to explain) is you just make two edit points: one in the middle of the held note and one after that note is finished. You then move that new clip later, drag out the end of either clip in the new space you just created, line up the waveforms, then add an equal gain crossfade.\n\nThere are several combinations of pro tools key commands to achieve this with many fewer clicks than I just described (nudging commands, option clicking and dragging, heal regions, etc), but those are easier to show than tell",

    "content": "@Akanksha Co-sign on what Matt has said here. Learning to write chord progressions is a strong skill to develop. Chords are what gives your song harmonic motion and a sense of going places. They can give it tension and release. A good progression will show you where to take the song next.\n\nOr you can write a melody first and then come up with chords underneath it. Whichever feels more natural to you. No wrong answers here.",
