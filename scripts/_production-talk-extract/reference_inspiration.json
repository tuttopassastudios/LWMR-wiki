I consider myself to be a fan of music *foremost* and a musician second. Even though I rate being a musician *very* highly. The impulse to make music is secondary to the urge to discover and appreciate it.\n\nTime spent listening to records is time lost doing something else. Whether that's performing music, raising a family, pursuing a career goal, or saving the world. In some senses I think of myself as a very lopsided individual.\n\nLife, in all of it's variety, is too big to get your arms around it all. So don't feel bad about prioritizing certain things to the detriment of other stuff. We can't do it all. Lean into the aspects that you enjoy most and then team up with those who have chosen to specialize in the things that you rank second.",

    "content": "This made me think of a production technique Ive stumbled on.  We all have our go to instincts that can lead to a similar feeling across a  record.  Generally there is a dominant instrument that the song was written on such as guitar or piano maybe a synth.  Take a filled out productions and mute all the main ingredients and leave the additive colors, only the sprinkles on top. And start rebuilding the production around that. It can take you to an entirely different  universe and provide contrast in the arch of the record",

I heard a great story of someone telling (I want to say) Richard Marx that he hadn\u2019t released his record yet cause he\u2019s a perfectionist and RM replied \u201cBullshit. Name one thing you\u2019ve ever done that\u2019s actually perfect. You\u2019re just scared to move on.\u201d  That story has stuck with me.\n\n2) I\u2019m a fairly decent guitar player, have made an actual career of being paid to do it. And I STILL am either constantly hiring people better than I or recording things note by note and then assembled in protools afterwards. Dr Luke might be the best guitarist I\u2019ve ever been around (and I\u2019ve hung with Blake Mills, Tim Pierce, Phil X), and he CONSTANTLY would just hit record, play the four chords of the song free time, and then cut them up and drop them on the ones or wherever they\u2019re supposed to go in the song. My favorite thing about making records vs performing them live is that on record NO ONE CARES how you got there, just that you did. Unless your groove has something particularly magic to offer I\u2019d get over the one take mentality pretty quick.",

Benny Blanco became successful with a folder full of songs at 120 bpm cause he didn\u2019t know how to change the tempo, and stacks of kick drums because he didn\u2019t know how to eq (he just layers a brighter kick on top if it needs more snap). When I\u2019d ask him why he pretty much did anything it was always \u201cI dunno, man, it just sounds cool!\u201d.

The issues almost always tend to be much less narrow in scope. Make sure you zoom out and just go \u201cis this cool?\u201d",

Everybody knows what to expect and what is to be expected. \n\nProfessionalism. The room is clean, mics are up, lighting is right, session is loaded. \n\nIntuition. All the artistic/personal things. Making the artist feel safe enough to be dangerous, knowing how hard you can push them to get a take, knowing where the line is between their vision and yours, etc\u2026\n\nSonics. I want my artists to feel expensive when they\u2019re recording, so getting the mic and cue mix right is everything. \n\nSpeed. A comp up by the time they\u2019re done tracking, a quick shine to make it feel special, and a bounce for them to take with them.\n\nEverything else is on a per session basis. I can deliver a fully mixed/tuned vocal and everything in between, so it all depends on communication ahead of time.",

Think Andrew Watt handled the vocals on that and did a fantastic job getting the take out of Luke. Dance Hall Days by Wang Chung is always a good reference. Mercy Street by Peter Gabriel (the whole SO record) pretty unfuckwithable. Bang Bang is always a great reference because you can really show a singer the difference between a Jessie J and an Arianna. Comes in handy in sessions a lot.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for creative, the whole Dissociatives record is a constant reference. I\u2019d start with \u201cHorror With Eyeballs\u201d",

I think as producers one of the biggest parts of our job is to be a grounding presence and a support for artists who can sometimes have pretty wild swings. But we\u2019re artists too in our own right with our own bipolar tendencies. In a way that can create an empathy bond between us\u2026we can understand the manic exuberance of making an amazing thing and how there\u2019s usually a pendulum swing in the other direction to compensate. But I kind of think our job as producers is to have our shit together enough to buffer that bipolar thing and make a sanctuary where an artist can feel at home. Just my random thought for the day.",

I had tried them once at @oaklandmatt\u2019s place and wasn\u2019t super impressed... just thought they sounded like hyped headphones. But I really wanted something with killer noise cancellation and something to potentially reference Spatial mixes. After purchasing, the more I used them, the more I fell in love with listening to music on them. I realized quite early on that there was a lot of parity between how things sounded in the APMaxes vs. my PMC 6-2s\u2026 similar low end presentation, similar high end. But just genuinely enjoyed listening to music on them.\n\nI was traveling for thanksgiving last year and a last minute mix opportunity came up for some video game trailer. Not my normal speed but they were up shits creek with a deadline and the money was good\u2026 so I mixed the whole thing start to finish on my laptop with the Airpods. I was a little sheepish about sending off un-vetted mixes, but the clients loved it and I saved the day. I curiously took a listen when I got back to my studio after the holiday and was very surprised that the mix was 98% there. There was maybe a small low end tweak I could\u2019ve made, but by and large, the mixes translated incredibly well. \n\nNow I use them much more for odd tasks, usually revisions and printing sessions. I can be on my couch on my laptop running files down with transparency mode on, still hanging with my family while watching a show, and lock in with noise cancelling when I need to focus.\n\nFor $600 they\u2019ve been a massive value-add to my work flow.",

(Once you hear Max Martin sing you can\u2019t unhear him on all those boy band (and even Brittney) tracks. \n\nIt\u2019s such a weird balance of the ego, because as a producer you have to be arrogant enough to go \u201cyour art should sound like THIS\u201d but you have to be humble enough to know when your idea isnt the best one.

It depends on where you are and where you\u2019re going, and most importantly actually knowing where you\u2019re going.\n\nI view the difference in shitty gear vs good gear as compound interest. A vintech one on one might sound basically like a vintage neve. ALMOST indistinguishable. But if you\u2019re using it on all 149 of the tracks you\u2019re compiling into a pop song, the end result is going to be 149 times more noticeable. The second floor of the leaning tower of Pisa looks pretty spot on but the people on the 15th floor are freaking out. \n\nThat said, I could record a garbage singer through my 251 and my chain, and if I didn\u2019t know what to do with it, it would still be garbage. The flip side is we actually demoed different mics and different chains on Paris Hilton. There was a right answer. And she\u2019s not gonna win any singing contests, but at the end of the day the cumulative effect of all the decisions we made led to tracks that are still being played in clubs to make people dance over a decade later.\n\nDetails matter in not just what the audience hears eventually, but what the artist hears initially, giving them the confidence and headspace to sprinkle in their extra few (sometime more than a few) percentage points of vibe that the audience attaches too later. Fix it in the mix is an abused concept because it doesn\u2019t take in to account the affect of shitty sound or feel on the performance. You think 1 mic doesn\u2019t matter? I\u2019ve heard people sing noticeably more in tune and in time when switching from DAW monitoring to direct monitoring. It ALL matters.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t understand songs, melody, rhythm, and how these things interact to move people? None of it matters.",

    "content": "I've been a \"musician\" since way before i started recording and producing stuff. (Since i was 4 i think). It's such an integral part of how music can feel and make you move. Think about how someone like Anderson paak. can make you dance by just playing 8th notes on a highhat and nothing else(see tinydesk for ref.) or Pino Paladino, will make you break your neck with his bass, playing simple Quater notes. (anything D'angelo).  Even in a genre that is as quantized and on the grid as it gets like a lot of hiphop/trap is, notice how the artist(rappers) that really stand out, are the ones that make those beats really groove/hit because of how they themselves \"groove\" or flow on those beats. They might be slightly behind or in front of the beat, or they might even swing a little. \n\nYou can really get into the micro and macro dynamics of groove. Listen to guys like Led zeppelin, how they might start out a song a few BPM slower than they finish, because of the build up of energy through out the song, and it doesn't sound wrong or unnatural. \n\nA fun thing to do, when looking for inspiration for grooves, is record some foley, and look for naturally occurring rhythms in the sample. Try and build a grove around that probably a bit wonky rhythm. It can really be an eye opening experience once you realise how much fun rhythm and groove is, when you don't have to obey the grid in a daw like a machine. \n\nBut like anything music, it's really about listening and feeling. Really internalising what a forward or laid back snare feels like or a bass thats almost a 16th behind the beat.",

    "content": "Ok. One last example (since I've already gone this far). Miles Davis. \n\nMiles had the technical chops. He had fathomless musical depth. He could write every single note of a big band chart if he wanted to, but he (with a few early exceptions) never did this.\n\nHis recipe for music making was this: \n\nA) Start with a great song (chords and melody)\nB) Curate a team of players with their own strong musical identities \nC) Bring them together and let them interpret the song\nD) Direct them on feel and how to listen to and respond to each other\n\nThat's it. Miles' music was never about big arranging moments, or written-out parts. He started with great raw material, great players, and great prompting and then he let them roam free and play.\n\nSo that's one more way to approach it. \n\nThere are two things that I keep coming back to in all of this: A great song and a vision. If you have those you can set your players free to surprise and astound you.",

But the best way is to just get more reps to get faster and better. 10,000 hours, no shortcuts.\n\nBut more actionable advice - stick to a slim number of EQ and Compressor plugs and just use those. For example 99% of my mixes just use pro q3, API-2500, and Kush AR-1. The idea being minimize variables and decisions, and use stuff you know ridiculously well.\n\nProduction side, I find having go to sounds, samples, and instruments (hardware or software) well learned and ready to go shortens the path from opening your project to creating music. For me, this is taking my free time to mess with my MPC and explore samples, or to create patches on my synths to become more intertwined with my instruments. This is separate from the actual \u201cI\u2019m gonna make a song today\u201d process.\n\nUltimately\u2026make a song in 8 hours as many days as you can.

    "content": "By far, the most important element in realistic orchestral sound is in the programming. You need a controller where you can automate cc1 and cc11 (modulation and expression). Instruments, especially strings, are constantly changing their volumes. Particularly on entrances and phrase-ends. If you don't have a controller for this, you can draw it all in, but that gets really tedious.\n\nIf you get that figured out, I can almost guarantee that just about any library out there will get you good results. So then it's just a matter of what sound do you gravitate towards, how elaborate of a feature set do you need, etc. Legatos are overrated and I'd take no legato over a poorly programmed one any day.\n\nIf you want a full orchestra, not just strings, I'd check out some of the all-in-one offerings from Spitfire (Albion, BBC Orchestra, or Abbey Road), East West, Orchestral Tools (Inspire), or VSL (Prime). They all will have several different articulations, a decent amount of dynamic layers, and a full set of orchestral instruments. Have a listen to them and see what sounds grab you. Spitfire and Orchestral Tools have a more prominent room sound baked in, but they all do to some extent. So be aware that, whichever library you choose, there's a certain amount of \"reverb\" (which is actually just the hall they're recorded in) that you will never be able to turn off.",

Listen.\n\nWhen it comes to groove or feel it's common for the ensemble to not line up perfectly or even *sound* as if they line up perfectly on transients. Quite often the band are flamming against each other in a way that is tasteful. Sometimes they're dead-on for a beat and the next moment they're doing a tight flam. \n\nDon't get lost solo'ing instruments. Keep the entire song section in perspective when you tweak. If you're having trouble making choices mute a few instruments, but don't solo.\n\nAlso, fader level has a massive influence on groove. Before you start editing too hard play with your fader balances and find the groove that way. Listen to how the proportion of instruments changes the groove. It may turn out you don't need to do much, if any, micro editing.",

Maybe something really trashy and blown-out like Devil-Loc or Vulf Compressor. Something that really messes with the proportions of a sample.\n8. Easy and flexible integration of feedback loops.\n9. Intuitive integration of polyrhythmic looping or sequencing.\n10. A feature for easy implementation of Steve Reich 'It's Gonna Rain' style tape loop phasing.\n11.

Pianos have big glisses, horns can squeal, bowed strings can sweep a fast legato scale up into the downbeat or do a large gliss.\n\nThen there's foley.

I've done it a lot and continue to do it periodically, even after making records for like 25 years. \n\nThink of this like practice, not as how to make *your* music. Trying to make a note for note, sound for sound copy of a song you like forces you to make moves and choose sounds you otherwise wouldn't choose.\n\nBy practicing in this way, you accumulate skills that become part of your subconscious creative arsenal.\n\nAgain, at this early point in your journey, there really are no right and wrong ways to make things. The key is to just make as much stuff as you can, trying as many different methods as possible.",

    "content": "@Zack Hames yeahhhh. watch the questlove video on youtube where he talks about d'angelo asking him to play crazy laid back and flammy too.\n\nmy general thought on timing is: behind the beat is more groovy and laid back (vocals, percussion, bass against the kick drum, etc) and ahead is intense and anxious (especially vocals).\n\nthere are many examples of groove being behind the beat as that's something people talk about a lot. definitely dive into that concept and play with laying different elements back off the grid.\n\nbut i LOVE talking about being ahead of the beat. purists complain that a lot of modern hip hop vocals are ahead of the beat and \"off time.\" but when it's done well it makes the tracks SO exciting. lil durk, 21 savage, gucci, etc all have this excitement in some of the songs because the vocal are ahead. \n\ni've heard the argument that these guys are just amateurish in their skill. that might be true, but their natural groove and cadence works. also listen to kendrick on \"Family Ties\" where he goes in and out of being ahead of the beat and it sounds exciting as fuck when he does.\n\nalso \"Icky Thump\" by White Stripes is a song with vocals that are entirely ahead of the beat. clearly it's deliberate as jack white is a rhythmic genius (and the doubles are perfect). it adds this anxiety to the whole song that is SO dope.",

Unless you're aiming for radio play, in which case I'd argue that if your song is *really* short then people are less likely to be exposed to it.\n\nFrom a cynical money-making standpoint, I think Spotify considers engagement with a song to have happened after the listener has listened for 30 seconds. I don't know what happens if a song is shorter than that.\n\nIf the song is good (but short) people will play it again. If the song is horrible then everyone will be relieved that it ended sooner. \ud83d\ude09",

Vibe is singer-songwriter, soul, RnB.\n\nWe tracked drums, bass, and keys live in the studio OD'd to scratch tracks we cooked up together. The scratch tracks / demos were just guitar vocal and we were really relying on the players to fill out the arrangements, but we knew more would be added down the line.\n\nAll the players were incredible. Could singe your eyebrows off with technical prowess and shredtastic chops. Tracks turned out great, still working on the arrangement, but..\n\nThis project has got me thinking more about the importance of how you present a song to session musicians and the 'space' you ask them to fill in a production. As well as the changing dynamics project to project affected by a revolving cast of participants, more fleshed out demos, etc... I find this a really interesting topic. Curious if anyone in the group has any unique experiences or insights whether as a producer or a musician.\n\nI've found that the more I flesh out demos with the artist beforehand the more bound and limited the session players we bring in are based off our decisions. This can make ODs more efficient, add a clearer direction, but can also remove the opportunity for the player to really add something special. Sometimes I don't want to be too suggestive b/c I want the players to have more of a blank canvas to work with.",

Often you\u2019ll be completely missing some modulator somewhere and you\u2019ll really need to dig through the synth\u2019s features to find something you didn\u2019t know before. As a bonus, you can try the same thing but have the synth that the preset comes from and the synth you\u2019re recreating it in be two different tools, like trying to remake you\u2019re favorite serum patch in Pigments. Sometimes certain features will be missing outright and you\u2019ll just have to use your ears to get close, but I find this really useful for figuring the inherent differences in the tools at my disposal. Best thing about both of these exercises is they only take about 10-15 minutes a patch, then you\u2019re on to something new",

    "content": "Okay @Nomograph Mastering , so I think the analogy is a little off. Music is a conversation, but it's a conversation between performers. At it's best, the performance is authentic, transcendent, and speaks to our souls in a way that real-world conversation with words can't do. But it's heightened, exaggerated, hyper-focused. If the song is written ahead of time, it's more akin to actors interpreting a script. The words are written, the notes are there. Unless we're talking about jazz improvisation, which is the closest we come to real world conversation, but even then, it's translated and performed. As much as Miles was saying what he wanted to say, he was saying it that way so that an audience would hear it, it wasn't a private conversation.\n\nNow, if you get incredible actors on a stage or in front of a camera, you can let them do their thing with minimal trickery, minimal edits, and it will move you to tears. The respond to each other and elevate the piece beyond what feels possible. Watch that same play as a community theater-level performance and feel nothing. The reality is that a lot of the artists that are coming through aren't Sidney Poitier. They're just not that good at making their music feel effortless. Not every play works as a film, and vice versa. Not every track benefits from having a band in a room. \n\nConfusing the genesis of songwriting (one person crafting both sides of a conversation) with the act of expressing that work (one person performing every part, a la Tom Hanks' motion capture of every character in The Polar Express). I know that ultimately you and I agree on the benefits of humans recording together, but the analogy feels too blurry to me.",

It's not exclusively about pre-production, but in recounting his career Phil offers a tremendous amount of practical philosophy on how to handle artists, shape a record, and solve problems.

You can get a Warm 47 for a grand or real 47 for 15 grand and they\u2019re preeeetttyy  close. But the devil is in the details. The original Dare you to Move (I think that song has had 4 different versions now) is pretty close to the Fields version\u2026 Fields rocked up the drums a little more, and by far most importantly  had my sage input (and gear) for a more kickass guitar sound. The song went from a heavily pushed song that couldn\u2019t quite get its footing for them to a massive multi platinum career defining hit. It can be frustrating to watch someone else turn something we got 95% of the way there into the thing that got released, but often times it\u2019s that exact skill which makes them worth the investment from the label. Understanding that difference and learning how to bridge the gap is the whole secret to making a living in this business.",

The same principle as passive listening -- you hear something totally different and it might be revealing in a way you can't access while actively listening.

It's important to recognize whether it's truly them or is it actually you.

There\u2019s something about his whole vibe that makes me think there are way more words than music coming from him. \nTalking and thinking about art is important, no doubt, and I love reflections about music that makes me think.\n\nThen I think of someone like Tchad Blake \u2014 who, by the way, is older than him \u2014 and he\u2019s the complete opposite. A guy who could\u2019ve retired already but is out here doing the most innovative, bold mixes of his career and working on super exciting music.\n\nI get super suspicious whenever someone says music sucks now.

I'm no Beckley, but browsing whats been previously shared here and trial and error has been the mechanism of growth for me.\n\nI kinda had the note separation tool workflow down from work in other programs. I've been experimenting with the time tool and attack speed tool as well as formant shifting to mask when the tuning becomes more audible than I'd like. That's probably where I'd pinpoint the level up for me personally. That and trying to be more conscious about not relying too much on the graphical UI. Unless it's something that really calls for hard tuning I lean towards wanting it to feel invisible / natural. Im realizing more what parts of the note actually need to be more 'on' and which can be more 'off' or just left alone. That and letting notes naturally drift to become more sharp as they tail off. If I'm too heavy handed it starts to feel lifeless to me. I'm also appreciating more the nuance of how one might approach different genres or styles with melodyne. Its humbling how powerful the program really is.\n\nThere've been a few moments with the attack speed tool that have felt like magic curing some subtleties of the performances that bug me, but I don't feel super confident that I have a grasp on that one yet. I've been working in standalone and importing a REF mix. For some reason I feel more confident dealing with esses in protools with RX or clip gain than I do melodyne idk why. Some frustrations have been flipping back and forth between tracks when tuning multiple files feels real clunky. I might be missing something about how best to do that. I wish, like with RX monitor, you could hear the vocal through your mix chain when tuning (is that possible?). Being able to rename exported files would be nice too like in RX.",

    "content": "One tip I'd give is to make your patch while you have a MIDI sequence playing. Not just some static, even arpeggio that you drew in, but a part that has different articulations, note lengths, velocities, and covers a range of notes.\n\nIt's easy when making a patch to just keep your finger on one key and go *doot doot doot* (tweak) *doot doot doot* (tweak again). What you can end up doing this way is optimizing the patch and parameters for a single note or handful of notes. And it gets old to listen to. By keeping the entire musical part playing you're going to move through building a well-balanced patch much quicker.\n\nIf you have a part in mind, record the MIDI with your starter/init patch, spend some time tweaking the patch while the sequence plays, and then once you get into the ballpark replay the MIDI part using your new patch. The new synth settings will influence your articulation and feel when you record the second time around. Then refine your patch as needed. Rinse and repeat until you're satisfied.",

Really handy to focus a chunk of the audio. You can control the range of say 2-5k, and then move the entire volume of that up and down as it only dances with 5db of itself. Useful.\n\nNot sure if I\u2019ve mixed a song where the c4 isn\u2019t on the drum bus somewhere.",

I think filling the in moments with your phone is the worst possible thing for a creative brain. Being creative is a practice and a muscle that needs exercising. I\u2019ve been trying to get artists more involved during the process so they have something to keep them occupied.

Electronic producers will spend a *lot* of time sculpting the volume envelope relative to the tempo. Trance producers have entire plugins that give them microscopic control over the pitch and volume envelopes of kick drums.\n\n2) **Presentation and proportion**. Is it up-front or does it sink into the back? It's easy for a 4x4 to feel hackneyed or overbearing. Sometimes all you need is a gentle *pat pat pat pat* to tie things together.\n\nA fresh or unconventional texture will open up drastically different feels. People can dance to anything if it's got a 4x4 click, so it doesn't necessarily *need* to be a kick. You can go far using samples and percussion that sit in different registers, but play the same role.\n\n3) **Complimentary instruments**. If the kick is the \"rock\" then the groove is going to come from how everything else swings over that. What's the friction like between the kick and the other elements? If the kick is a \"straight man\", then the other elements pushing off of it are where the magic comes from.",

Give him loads of feedback and make it an opportunity you can both grow from. I would take it through 3-4 revisions with him before you A/B with the artist and the other spec mix. Because the money she is saving by using a newer mixer is gonna be made up for in the extra time it could take to get to the right mix. \n\nNow if the kid is working for free some issues could arise with time management and whether he would prioritize the work, so it could be healthy for that to be a conversation with the artist\u2019s friend early on. The artist may lose a lot of time by trying to save a bit of money. This is what makes free work tricky. \n\nIf you end up circumventing the downsides of the inexperienced/free friend, it could be a win win for everyone, but that\u2019s a big-ish \u201cif\u201d.

As long as it\u2019s not overly prescriptive (\u201cnow click here, then turn drive to 5\u201d), I can interpret what they\u2019re imagining and achieve it through the filter of what I can anticipate will work well. But the results of those sleigh rides are always way more interesting to me than whatever I would\u2019ve come out with left to my own devices.\n\nHave to say the OP1 is a great toy to shove in any artist\u2019s hand though. I still don\u2019t know how to use it either, so we\u2019re both just chimping it like the start of 2001 Space Odyssey, and wild stuff usually comes out.\n\nToys are good, I think folks just need to implicitly understand they can pick up anything they like in your room and have at it. So it\u2019s about creating an atmosphere where everyone knows their input is valued and that it could be the stepping stone to something great, even if it\u2019s not the end result itself.",

It's a bit more nuanced. \n\nIf you are truly a producer collaborator (as opposed to a hired gun engineer or musician), it's about trying all the ideas and collectively deciding what's best. But remember YOU are the one who holds the keys to the execution of the artist's ideas. You can have ideas and try them yourself, but if the artist has ideas, it's still YOU that has to execute them (because presumably they're not a producer like you). \n\nSo you're actually building a big creative trust by helping the artist try stuff. If you can execute ideas that the artist can't quite articulate or do themselves, you gain a credibility where you can both listen and then say \"Ah, I see what you mean. I think this other version is best.\"",

When Dann Huff heard it he told Brett \u201cwe\u2019ll just upgrade Noah\u2019s track to Master Scale. It\u2019s not gonna get any better than that.\u201d\n\nWhen they went into the studio, they ended up taking the Mayer idea all the way, and the whole thing kinda went Country \u201cDon\u2019t Trust Myself.\u201d They couldn\u2019t do a Mayer solo on top of a Mayer vibe cause it would go from inspired by to straight derivative. \n\nMy solo didn\u2019t make the record, and I didn\u2019t get any production credit. But the guy who did the demo did. I did get some BGVs on it and paid accordingly. All that felt right to me.",

But even when still in the production grind I like having guitars laying around so I can grab one when I take a break or bring on in the house with me. If you have the flexibility, w/o compromising deadlines, I've found it helpful to leave room to indulge the moments when songs / melodies / lyrics pop into my head even when my expectation that day was to work on a mix or other production.

    "content": "Ooo I love this question. I'm currently on a journey with this idea that 'arranging is mixing'. There are a few things I've learned / frameworks that have been helpful to me recently.\n\nI have noticed that in the past in my own approach to production (as well as with some clients who send me their productions to mix) the way I thought about building the track was like assembling / stacking static blocks on top of each other. This realized more as a mental construct and not fully so in practical application. Intuition still served. But this framing became problematic and I think is endemic in music created with primarily loops and samples.\n\nI remember hearing Jon's comments on his 'temporal approach' to mixing which he wrote about on his site (I believe a link surfaced here a few months back). Some of the language Jon used was helpful to me (i.e. painting with sound). I started to think about my productions instead like film. Each second of each section of the song is a new scene unfolding. Every type of processor then becomes a way to adjust and enhance the emotion of the characters in the story. Not static but changing and adapting to align with the central spirit of the song. I tried to find more useful metaphors (i.e. sommelier of sound, a song tour guide, like I was piloting a space ship and mix elements were asteroids). It's one thing to lay down some parts and call it a song and another to consider what is the experience of these parts through time. I think less experienced engineers and often artists who record themselves are not considering pretty much every one of @Slow Hand 's points which creates a real challenge for the mixer.",

Typically the higher pitched/attacky things like hi hats come earlier than the sub kicks for example but experiment with it and see what sounds good.

    "content": "I feel you, especially in boom bap there's a lot that goes into that drunken swing feel. Same with tradition African groove. Easiest way is to load up a clip or loop from a drummer you like and extracting groove templates. You can quantize to the groove of your favorite drummer or a drum loop you dig. This will get you the results, but groove is a never ending journey of learning. Editing groove to make it feel the way you want to feel takes an understanding of what makes things groove one way or the other. It can be accents, dynamics, lengths of the notes, how much you deviate from the grid or what subdivisions you're on, and how the timing offsets rub and interact with each other in the whole instrumentation. Some drummers have really solid quintuplet swing, so instead of doing tripplet swing they'll play on the downbeat and the 3rd or 4th note of quintuplet. For this you can listen to guys like Nate Smith, he plays swings differently live than recordings- he drags and pushes the kicks and snares in recordings but for live, he only swings hats so there's more steady groove for other musicians to grab onto. \n\nOn the other hand, for playing the grooves yourself- I find it helpful to dance and groove to the rhythms as much as I can to absorb the feel and internalize them. But in order to play ahead or behind with authority, you need to know where the grids are and metronome practice is crucial. I'm not that great at timing either, so I'm trying to do as much reps in with metronomes as I can. Learning to play on the grid is a first step before learning how to deviate with clear intention. I hope this helps!",

    "content": "yes agreed, production wise you can follow those roland drum kits pretty much through every decade to this day. its amazing to me that a number of todays budding producers can name these things partially, for example referring to the Roland 808 Kick Long and not know anything about the Roland 808, let alone the other modules. ......and parrallel to the \"808 \", the 909 is still to this day, going strong in house with the likes of MK . From a production/mix viewpoint....i suppose these sounds themselves hit with such a charcter in the right frequencies that there must be something intrinsically appealing to us that will keep them forever relevant.Im diving back into the Linndrum Clap and the old Jermain Dupri / So So Def claps at the mo for a little diff sonic character .....they are all still in the same ilk as the rolands though. \n\nre: the drill hats.....thats another cyclical pattern there. In the uk thats been appearing and reforming for decades now. its a soca pattern that the uk appropriated into a period of uk garage production (about the same time that 2 step began to mutate into the hip-hop influenced So Solid style )......and then dipped into a scene we had follwing called UkFunky ( a mix of Us House and Carribean influenced drum patterns and bass) . Then it re-appeared again in those drill hats once the uk appropriated/re-mouldedd chicsago drill",

A lot of tech these days enables that ease and has opened the door to more people writing and producing their records.\n\nBut a secondary side-effect that I think we can all observe - and I think this is more to your point - is that musicians are leaning into those methods and not pursuing the hard work and practice that is necessary to do things like singing well, or playing piano with more than a base level of proficiency, or orchestrating an ensemble well. The expressive unlock of being highly proficient isn't being pursued like it was in the past decades (before we had so may technological means). People are - broadly speaking - more satisfied these days to settle for records that don't push into that potential.\n\nWhat we lose are the heights of expression that virtuosity unlocks. Whether that's singing like Aretha Franklin, or playing a simple ballad like Bill Evans, or writing a song with as much sophistication and lyrical wit as Joni Mitchell.",

Audiences in the 1800s, for instance, could go to a symphonic concert and recognize sonata form, key centers, etc. There was an appreciation for the form of the music and the virtuosity of the player first and foremost. Acknowledgement of skill. Making things seem effortless was the ideal.\n\nContemporary listeners seem to connect more with the struggle. They want to hear the grit in the vocal, the player at the edge of their ability (whatever it may be) holding on for dear life. The mix at the edge of distortion. In that breaking point, there is a lot of beauty and emotion that would have traditionally been considered bad form. Uncouth, even!",

If there are things that can be addressed easily and quickly, by all means go for it. But it\u2019s still important to be careful to not let that inject any doubts in the performers. I fuck up on this all the time, even though I fuck up less the more I do it- it\u2019s still not an easy thing to do. It\u2019s not even a person to person thing.. it\u2019s a moment to moment thing.

Honestly you\u2019ve got a routine going and you know what the artist needs to be happy with his performance- seems like you\u2019ve got a leg up there. You can\u2019t practice the show, you gotta just play the show. Sometimes you don\u2019t know what works till you hear it back. \n\nI re-recorded the bass line again on a song I was finishing up today- had to do it 3 times over the course of production. \n\nSlack, curiosity, deep breaths.",

By doing that they lost the heart of the song. The magic was in the umami effect lyrically and in performace of the vocal over the uke. The way her vocal would dance around feeling loose and unsure to striking and confident. \"Im confident im insecure.\" Is such a clever contradiction. There was nothing unsure or lacking in confidence in this final production or vocal performace. It was, we're as talented as anyone on earth, listen and watch!!

Analog gear hasn't really progressed much and a pultec/Neve EQ is still one of the best EQs ever for instance. Those records still sound great for that reason. As for punk and hardcore it's interesting: do people genuinely still listen to those records? I've revisited a few old punk records which I used to think were amazing. The songs are great but the listening experience just isn't enjoyable for me anymore, in part due to messy playing  and bad recording/mixing. With bad I mean the playing distracts from the groove of the band and the mixing distracts from the song, where it does not support the dynamic shifts",

    "content": "(It\u2019s all super project dependant) If I\u2019m both producing and tracking I\u2019ll often just get the production to a point where it\u2019s good to write to and simple enough to have ideas flow. Then throw it into a vocal tracking session and get the demo vocals and get the song written and record a few too many parts. Then produce the song around the song and vocals. Usually I\u2019ll have beat and vocals separate, but sometimes it makes more sense to have in the same session. Depends on the song. But I always track over a 2 track. Because it takes a lot of risk out of having some random synth or plug-in chain from the production mess up the session while trying to get good takes with the artist.(total buzzkill if you have to restart a session when the vocalist is in the zone) \nBut again soooooo project dependant. Depends on how the artist likes to work, time line, amount of sessions that are possible to have together and so on. Sometimes you\u2019ll only have one day with an artist, and if you are also producing, leave all the cool production tricks til later and get the best vocals you can get.",

    "content": "I feel like groove is so subjective so we\u2019re probably all wrong and all right to some degree\u2026but I almost never let my bass be off grid. I always find the impact lessened when I do. Something about a lack of confidence in the low end makes me like the song less. There are exceptions but they are rare imo. And I hardly ever let the down beats of transitions be off grid too. I usually want the sections to be obvious. I also start with going behind the beat first. I have also recently in the last year or so found that if I start with getting the very basic part of the groove right first, I am less likely to overcrowd my production. So before I put hats in, I\u2019ll just put in snare and kick and try and find the groove with just those 2 elements (unless there is some other clear rhythmic element at play) but I feel like if you can\u2019t feel the groove with just the kick and (snare/clap/perc) then it\u2019s not there.",

    "content": "I agree with @BatMeckley's approach on this. Have them execute your vision, and then once you have it let them go wild and swing big. Try something new.\n\nIt's up to either the artist or you, as the producer, to have a vision for what the song is, where it's going, and what it needs. One of you have to have a roadmap. *Someone* needs to have the vision. To be the leader. To steer the ship.\n\nIf the vision is not clear then perhaps the song itself needs to be refined some more until it has a strong identity. That will be your north star for creative decisions. \n\nIf you can convey the essence of the song to your players, the emotion behind it, then they can interpret that feeling in a way that is uniquely them without the need for you to dictate their parts. If you can give them an emotion and maybe some general contour of what you're hearing then they can fill in the spaces and bring their own qualities.\n\nAs producer, part of your job is curating the talent that you recruit to realize your vision. If you know what the song needs you can confidently pick a player with complimentary sensibilities. If you can pick the right person then very often most of the work is done by virtue of them being aligned with the song. Each of their contributions and ideas are likely to be excellent.\n\n----",

    "content": "If you're concerned about being too suggestive to the players about their parts then strip back the demo until it contains only the most essential parts. No fancy stuff. Just chords, melody, and lyric. *Maybe* a kick drum pattern. Lead sheet style.\n\nIf the song is good then it will still be compelling. The best songs tend to be very robust and can be played a dozen different ways because they are fundamentally compelling. If the demo doesn't feel good this way then the song may need more work.\n\nLesser songs will depend on the arrangement or production to be compelling, or only work in a narrow band of styles. Sometimes a song can only work one way. It's okay if this is the case for your song, but then it's up to you to present the demo with the arrangement or elements that are essential to make the song compelling, and that will close off more and more of the instrumental possibilities.\n\nSo if you want to increase the chances of a session player delivering an unexpected, brilliant, idea then set them up for success with a strong song that can be interpreted many ways.\n\n----",

If I get a whiff of it without having asked for it I have an allergic reaction.\n\nA lot of people don't know what they don't know. They don't understand how much effort goes into tuning or finessing a vocal performance. From their perspective they laid down a great one and when the final comp shows up sounding amazing they might assume that all you did was comp a few takes, EQ, add some compression and *voila*. They don't know about the hours and hours you spent getting it all just-so, listening, and then adjusting again. Not to mention your years of hard-won judgement that allow you to know when it's the correct move. That's all invisible to the client.\n\nOf course, pros will likely know all of this because they've had the experience enough times. They're less likely to challenge you on why your all-in fee is at such a level.",

To the client/artist, the work either resonates or it doesn't, elevates or not. And that's how it should be. Helping people zoom out and focus on the FEEL difference that's been made seems like a start, but as we all know, it can be hard to see the forest for the trees. And if the artist is hyper-focused on how much reverb is on the vocal, they're losing the context of WHY the decision was made, and how it feels as a whole. \n\nI don't have answers here, but I'm curious of other's thoughts.",

My level of understanding was that instead of squashing peaks down (a la comp / limiter ) they just shaved them off and so the rest of the material could remain less compressed for the same rms . I\u2019d not realised at all that those clipped peaks are  sort of returned / recycled into the signal . Fascinating . Thanks for the enlightenment man . I\u2019ll have to read up on that . And this fact of course gives evidence to your point that using a delta is a longer way round to try and achieve much the same . I listened to the delta in kotelnikov and couldn\u2019t see how it could sound musical to return that to the mixbus . It sounded like the sound of mp3 stream buffering glitches , so I figured I must not have understood something and left it at that . With the potential imo for phase issues I left the idea behind , but I was intrigued if Ryan\u2019s comment about deltas pertained to the same thing . Another lesson learned here today .

It was one of those \"aha!\" moments for me.\n\nJust because you're recording to a click doesn't mean you can't build in some of a musician's natural tendencies to speed up and slow down. It's only a limitation if you let it be. (But I will echo @SoundsLikeJoe and @Ross Fortune , sometimes the only way is without a click. Whatever serves the song best)",

(just listen to Please Please Please there's different stuff happening ALL the time)\n\nNow whenever I try doing something that's maybe using the stereo field more than your run of the mill pop production I get a bit afraid of it being too obvious/distracting/unbalanced etc. or simply sounding more like an accident than a concious decision. \n\nWhen you guys have something on one side, do you always balance with something on the other side or do you sometimes simply have smthg on its own on the left / right? \n\nHow do you make sure it sounds meaningful and intentional rather than being just \"oh they panned that to the side\" \n\nWhat about stuff like pads? I normally never pan that to either side (again being afraid of it sounding too weird) \n\nHope I'm making sense here and looking forward to hearing your perspectives on this!",

One of my favorite beats of all time is Fleetwood Mac's \"Hypnotized\" which is a swingy, triplet unchanging thing that is effectively a drum loop through the song, except Mick Fleetwood plays it. I recreated it using a sample pack of Mick Fleetwood's and turned it into a song after serious finagling, especially in the context of grid music. The insight into accent, velocity, swing, where in the grid things hit (or don't), which specific hits matter and how dropping just one or two key hits in a repetitive pattern can shift the groove entirely. It also tests your chops for figuring out choke groups, how to make closed and open hi hats sound \"real\" (if that's your goal) so on and so forth. I also love recreating a beat as a way in when musical inspiration may be lacking.",

But to play devil's advocate, if the OP's future work is hypothetically being mixed by a shitty mixer then he's probably not going to get 5 more years of work as a producer. If the OP invests strategically in great songs and great productions he's probably going to get more work. And that work is likely going to trend towards being with the type of artists who don't hire shitty mixers to mix their records. We tend to compartmentalize our roles but I'm skeptical any future client or the market in general is going to be as discerning. *Who* wants to hire the producer who made the record that sounds 'bad'?",

For context, we\u2019re doing two songs, and one seems to be coming together pretty easily, and the other is the tough one. Been trying to give all their ideas a shot thinking they\u2019ll either work or it\u2019ll be obvious that it\u2019s not the one (which usually leads to a unanimous decision), but he\u2019s concluded that a lot of these ideas will work \u201conce more stuff is in the track.\u201d Curious how to steer us in (what I believe is) a more viable direction in a non domineering way.

And to your point about being patient, I think all we needed was a little more time to try stuff out and get on the same page. A good reminder not to sweat it too hard if I leave a session worried about the current state of the music. Putting it down for the evening and coming back with fresh ears does wonders. (Also should note that \"arrangement decisions\" was a massive oversimplification of the questions we were trying to answer lol).\n\nApologies if this turns into a novel, but would love to share some takeaways. I think the north star point you made is super important and well put. I think the artist I was working with got more comfortable trying new ideas the more he realized we were both aiming at the same thing (just approaching it differently). He's also only recorded / released one song before (and doesn't have much prior experience collaborating), so I totally understand the fear of things sounding different than he imagined. That's not a knock on the artist at all - I say that matter of factly and it's where everybody starts.\n\n@NoahNeedleman made an analogy about being a \"doctor vs a doula\" which I found super insightful. I think I was afraid that trying to be a \"doctor\" at all was somehow inherently an ego move or underestimating the artist's instincts. Ended up concluding that the project required a little bit of both, and that it's 100% okay and helpful to know where my experience could help us reach the artist's intention. I think interpreting the artist's intention is so much of the job, and if they don't yet have the tools or experience, that may push our job a little more to the doctoring side. There was definitely still some doulaing of course.",

I'll play with forward swing and dragging notes a lot if I'm going for a more real/dynamic feel when programming. keeping in mind that if the goal is trying to stay \"on time\" any fwd swing that might happen at the start of a phrase will be compensated with some drag  after or vice versa.  keeping velocities in mind w drum hits + linking it to a filter env so that harder hits have more high end and softer hits end up a bit rounder.\n\nadding subtle layers that are similar   to the main drums but occupy a different texture or tone  in dif  sections to thicken up the groove or automate the attack /sustain of certain elements thru diff sections to help shift the listener  focus throughout",

    "content": "(Ok. Now I'm starting to run with this train of thought. Now would be a good time to step off if you've gotten what you need.)\n\nI don't want this to sound like the end-all be-all. One of my absolute favorites is James Brown, and there is no way that some of his songs would hold up to the level of scrutiny I'm describing. And those records *kill*. It's all vibe. It's vibe all the way down, bebe. Not a chord change in sight. Barely a melody in some cases. And that's alright.\n\nSo what did James do? More often than not James would get all of his band (real jazz killers) in the studio and he would sing the parts to them one by one and allow them to input their own feel.\n\nHe'd start with the drummer and have them play a pattern that James was feeling. Once the drummer was jamming on that he would move on to the bass player and sing them an idea. Once the bass player had that germ of an idea they would continue to jam on it with the drummer, refining and adding their own thing. Then James would move on to the horns, and so on, and so on.\n\nWhile James could be dictatorial and (from the perspective of music education) the least technically qualified person in the room he had *vision*. \n\nIf the song has a strong identity you can give your players a good (non-technical) prompt and they can interpret that through their own sensibilities. You can describe a mood, or a scene, or an abstract sensation.\n\nR. Kelly once said (I'm paraphrasing): \"RnB is supposed to feel like the best moment of your *life*.\" That simple description conveys so much about the feel, the pleasure, and the joy that he is looking for in his music. It also excludes a lot of possibilities as well. If you can give your players a prompt like *that* then you can get everyone aligned on the same wavelength and it will carry you so much further without the need to dictate parts.\n\n----",

Could go many diff directions.. how do we facilitate those \u2018special\u2019 moments with session players? Which I like the idea of getting the piece you know you want or need first and then playing the rest of the time. Or how to communicate and prevent really good players from over powering a song and doing too much? For this project I chose to leave a lot of room for the players to play and write their own parts, but I also needed to reel them in a little bit and simplify what was happening. Even then when I dug through the tracks I had to mute certain fills, take a simpler pass of the keys to let the bass do it\u2019s thing or vice versa. This also makes me consider the question: when do you let a song suggest to you when something special needs to happen?",

The last project I worked on before the one I mentioned just above was with an artist who had no vision and deferred to me on almost every choice. My \u2018demo\u2019 for the most part became the record with very little outside collaboration not necessarily by my choice but by outside constraints from the artist (I.e. budget and time). I will say the song turned out killer and we both were happy with it but certain avenues were for sure closed along the way that maybe would have served the song more. The project I mentioned in the initial post here was flipped. The artist has a vision and wants to co-produce the record and the \u2018demo\u2019 was the most naked version of the song. I think now the contrast of those two projects is why I\u2019m ruminating on all this \ud83e\uddd0",

    "content": "Wow, this is a dream come true on so many levels. I\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity to have someone listen to my Antares complaints! First, it\u2019s insanely glitchy on my M1 computer which is funny since this is the version that\u2019s supposed to be compatible. Still running Pro Tools through Rosetta but Auto Tune will consistently freeze up my sessions to the point of me uninstalling it and going back to the previous version. So that made it unusable for me right off the bat. Second, for some reason, it has a mix knob. Even if I wanted to blend an octave down or some effected vocal with the dry, I\u2019d want the dry to be in tune. Not a natural dry vocal against a tuned octave down. Third, the default in AAX I remember was the craziest setting. I forget exactly what it was but I remember spending 20 minutes just trying to get it to tune and relearn where everything was. My last  biggest issue is that I\u2019m pretty sure Code Meter (Antares iLok substitute) kicks Dante in the balls every time it wants to check my license. This means late packets on my DVS and in extreme circumstances, drop outs. Autotune doesn\u2019t even have to be in the session for this to happen. This is a hard issue to prove so I\u2019m still a little unsure if I\u2019m right about this one but after uninstalling everything Antares, this problem went away. Super niche issue but wanted to throw it in there since it\u2019s been causing gray hairs lately",

How do you make the call between following an artists ideas and helping them to articulate those ideas vs following your own instincts  that it\u2019s time to move the process on and finish adding ideas in order to resolve and complete ? Ie . Recently I completed a project to master with an artist who was over the moon , planning the video \u2026.no complaints , pure buzz , a few weeks later . I get the message \u201chey man I was just thinking what if we try and add a piano part \u201c . Imo the song doesn\u2019t demand it , I suspect friends and armchair mozarts have thrown in their own 2 pence in the last few weeks and now what was in all our opinions \ud83d\udd25, has to face tinkering . I don\u2019t like telling people what to think , ie . I think you\u2019re making a mistake \u2026..but I don\u2019t like overwriting songs , so for me it\u2019s a obvious f that idea let\u2019s just write another one  . I\u2019d be interested in others internal dialogue with regards to when / if/ how you say no \u2026.and if it sits with you alright personally or you find it problematic (and I ask this in order to find charming but assertive ways to keep the door closed on a project when it truly felt  finished to all involved  and went to full completion / master and release strategy and now as the producer you truly believe it can only be damaged by changes )",

I agree with you very much (at my own current level ) with regards to what mastering means, I agree it should feel like a sacred moment for everyone . Stepping away from the work and letting it take on its own life in the world , not continually calling it back for \u201cwhat ifs and afterthoughts \u201c until the moment it was , is lost ...and now its not the capture and articulation of those days in the studio....but musical ponderings attached to those studio moments . But how to articulate this to a young artist who hasn\u2019t been through this passage yet can be tricky. In my culture , here in south London we are v careful to never tell each other what to think or to \u201ccorrect\u201d one another , it\u2019s felt as a disrespect and respect is all in my circles.....I don\u2019t disagree with it, but it makes it very hard to create \u201cteachable moments \u201c . The ideas I\u2019ve received from you and Noah are both genuinely applicable and helpful though in exactly this conundrum and I feel a little lighter already . \u201cWeighting \u201c:is a great concept to consider .

Trey Spruance has said on a few occasions that their seemingly arabic-sounding music would sound just as foreign to an arab musician as it would to an American listener.

Speaking of gun crime I honestly think media portrayal has a lot to be blamed for in the increase of gun violence between young men. Media portrayal glorifies the kind of lifestyle that people with no choice used to have to survive in. Now a lot of young kids with choice not to join gangs wanna join because that\u2019s where they find the sense of community. People wanna become what they see and what they know. \n\nI\u2019m completely with you on the lil kim style wave- it was cool when she did it, she did it her own way. But whatever\u2019s happening now in the name of women empowerment is doing the exact opposite of what it is meant to do. It\u2019s not my place to really say, but I think it really conformed the path of success for women rappers into a tiny box. Modern R&B and Hip Hop being closely linked together, same with Female R&B artist\u2019s stereotypical toxic relationship songs are also its own box that I can\u2019t seem to avoid wherever I go. R&B at least seem to have more diversity in the type of stories that become heard, hip hop is a lot less like that. \n\nThere are tons of talented women rappers not in that box, but they don\u2019t make it as big nor do people care as much. Kind of frustrating how uniform it has become\u2026 But I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s dead. It\u2019s dead to me, or to you- but it\u2019s still pretty much what people wanna hear all day long.",

Kind of odd it being a huge business aiming for profit\u2026 while people doing great work deserve money and great living, it\u2019s kind of ironic how the initial purpose of where the movement started from gets corrupted by the corporate nature of it.

How it\u2019s framed matters in my humble opinion, the general wave kind of became a museum docent giving the wrong context to the work and being misinterpreted. I believe the context should be clear, and that\u2019s not quite the case right now as far as what I\u2019ve been seeing.

    "content": "hey all, if this has been answered, point me the right direction. lurked for awhile, never posted. big fan tho. earlier this year I moved all my production over to Ableton from ProTools after like a decade and it's been amazing. still using PT for all the things it's better at, but now that I have key commands more nailed down in Ableton, been super happy producing there. so fast... but I need a little help with file management. coming from PT, the last bounce location is always recalled per session, so when you reopen a session, bounces go to the last designated location. with Ableton, the last bounce location seems to recall to wherever you last bounced in general... not by project. wondering what the best workaround for this is when bouncing many versions of a number of songs - i.e. I have six songs I'm working on, and bouncing versions for dubs, some stems, and roughs for the client. I would love to not manually select the bouces folder I have created per project, as it's a lot of menu diving.. I can't seem to find a bounce location settings in preferences.. so figured I would ask the ableton wizards here. or is it best to just create a master bounces folder per EP or record and add to it as I go? kind of annoying if so, but I have learned enough workflow changes, I can adopt something like that.",

If you have a death metal performance, your not going to run it through a (insert favorite pop singer name) model and have it sound anything like that artist. Its just going to have the timbre of their voice",

I know how to play piano and strumming acoustic guitar a bit. I started to using a DAW in my 14s (FL Studio, yeah I know xD) and in the last 3 years I've been using Logic Pro and last months Pro Tools (just for editing and mixing).\n\nI love to produce electronic pop with a mix between synths and acoustic instruments. I want to be more versatile and confortable producing other genres (genres that I can produce just in my bedroom studio without having a great recording gear). \n\nI'm feeling stuck, I'm trying to listen different genres. I'm feeling very limited because I don't have a great background as a music player or student (my bsc is physics engineering). The music industry is tough and I want to be more confortable to work in other genres.\n\nI tried to be as brief as possible. What advice do you have for this situation? If I forgot to say something, I am free to respond. Thank you for your attention! Sorry about my english. \ud83d\ude42",

Especially my songwriting seems to suffer since I spend so much time on producing. \nFor the record I\u2018m a \u201esit down on a piano and write the song from start to finish\u201c instead of a \u201e let\u2018s make some loop and throw some toplines on it\u201c type of guy \nSo since I spend most of my time on producing I wonder if you have/had the same problem and any strategies to avoid it?",

Also, a lot of things that have loose rhythm in a way that people tend to love often bother me and sound out of time to me. Jay-Z is a perfect example of this. I spent years thinking his rhythm was terrible before I realized he was doing a shuffle time feel where the amount his vocal is off from the snare creates the shuffle. I just didn\u2019t pick up on that for like\u2026 15 years? And just wondered why nobody else was bothered him being \u201cout of time\u201d. Kind of like when people with an undeveloped sense of harmony think of jazz as simply being an excuse for allowing wrong notes. That\u2019s how I hear people that are famous for stretching rhythm",

I\u2019m still working on being right on the grid by playing with metronome, and I found that actually improved my feel for all kinds of styles of groove.

The amount of times that I showed something that I thought was good and was rejected, and the times I showed something I hated and got good reactions from  people. You really never know! \n\nI\u2019ve been doing more writing sessions these days (once or twice a week or so), and I\u2019m really falling in love with this because I can get out of my own head and look around to get a sense of whether an idea is working or not outside of my own opinions\n\nSpeaking of the relentless will to finish: would it be a producer\u2019s job to stay on top of getting others in team to get their parts done? If I\u2019ve done my part already and completed it, do I keep bothering them to get their parts done? (lyrics etc) \n\nI read your reply to someone asking about writing sessions, and you said your biggest goal is to get the vocals from the first spark of inspiration on that same day. I\u2019ve had sessions where I get a basic bone of ideas with beat done, and top line is done but the lyrics are recorded in Gibberish and stream of consciousness. I would return, complete the arrangement on my own - send it back, they said they fuck with it and tells me they will finish the lyrics. How long do I wait, do I follow up at all, or do I just move on and keep making more? I don\u2019t want to overstep or rush people (and.. I can\u2019t get anyone to anything of course), but I also want to get the song done while I\u2019m excited so I can keep moving forward. It\u2019s hard to tell if I can even do about it or if I should just keep it moving and leave it be",

Leaves no strong impression, or the impression that the performance lacks intention.\n\nBand rocks (his guitar included), Harmonies and Gang Vocals are cool. \nReally the lead vocal is the only thing in the way of getting the song to be really good. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel like his intuition for the release date (deadline is in 4 days) is good and could be very valuable for us.\nOn the other, I don't see why anyone would be truly excited for us if singer is mid.\n(I know he's good deep down, he's given me chills when singing with no pressure, rn we're just lacking some of that magic.)\n\nAs the song is today, you wouldn't love to listen to the song on your way to work or school, enjoying it for what it is.\n\nAnyway, right now I'm going to try and squeeze that magic out of him in the next following days when we can see each other.\nAs I'm typing this I also realize I should send him the instrumental and let him try shit alone. \n\nMaybe that's my answer.",

I love love love Halloween, the chorus just punches me in the guts, but what else punched me in the guts was that the gatekeeping by the guy. I mean music and art in general is supposed to be moving culture forward, right??. Old man has had his plate of cake throughout his career, whats wrong if he teaches the knowledge to a new generation, that way more talent comes out and we get to hear amazing music in the future. Not to degrade his work, Ethan Gruska and Tony has done a phenomenal job on the album.  I would never, Personally gatekeep any knowledge if i made something like Punisher, The Album Is THAT GOOD. Thats what i would do. Not judging anyone whatsoever, but felt bad to see a producer i look upto \u201cGatekeep\u201d sauce just so no one is on his level soundwise.",

What blew me up was, most of the modern productions in the pop side of industry, the sad songs, all of them are inspirationally ripping phoebe\u2019s sound. I was mad at tony berg when i saw his interview where he gatekept a vst they used throughout the album to get that muffled texture. But in the past two days, i also realised he said \u201cWe are not going to tell you the vst just so you at home can not replicate the sound\u201d. I thought that was asshollery until i realised that they are actually being ripped so hard in the industry and that they really gotta protect their sound. Tony, Phoebe, Ethan these guys are hidden unknown diamonds \u201ci think (like me) a lot of people know phoebe as a celebrity than a music artist, or that was just me being lazy to check out her songs\u201d but i feel like everyone needs to experience their music.",

    "content": "Need some advice here! I've been working with an artist for a little over a year, have made 8 or 9 songs. We've had to retrack vocals for nearly every song because the performance just isn't quite there yet, but we always get it where we want it in the second session. I'm noticing a pattern of him sitting with the vocal and realizing he wants to sing it differently/better, but only feels this after we've tracked it once. Today was day 1 tracking vocals on a new song and it got to the point where i realized we were going to have to try again another day, I was felt fed up. I tried to discern what exactly i was frustrated at. Part of me was frustrated because it doesnt seem like he is ever truly prepared to track vocals, in the sense of being warmed up, having ideas of how he wants to sing, practicing ahead of time, singing random stuff in between takes, etc. The other part of me was frustrated with myself because im aware some of the responsibility falls on me as the producer/coach. I have no problem taking time to edit the vocal, i know it's part of the job, i enjoy it in fact haha - but is it fair to have certain expectations from him as the artist? I want to have a conversation with him about it but also be clear that i want to be better at my job too",

While there are always ways for us to improve as vocal producers and editors at the end of the day a really good comp of a bad performance isn't going to be as compelling as a good performance (maybe there are some exceptions). It sounds like you've been getting good performances the second time around so maybe that's all that matters but it might be worth having a conversation about how the artist can come in better prepared in the future (sharing practice strategies rather than scolding).",

He wanted me to do everything short of actually singing it, and then he was hard to get a half decent vocal out of. Because I felt like I was barely even making art at some point, I just stopped booking with him and he just hit me up last week saying he\u2019s trying to write on his own again. Odd perspective, but I think I was too helpful and because he was insecure about his thoughts, ideas, and abilities, he ended up using me as a crutch, which is partly my fault. In the end, me moving on made him want to write again and I think that\u2019s a super positive outcome considering I had a lot of negative feelings about it at the beginning of the year",

It\u2019s just acoustic guitar + vocals on an iPhone video. There\u2019s a strong fanbase asking for a few songs in particular that we\u2019re trying to cut studio versions for in January. \n\nQUESTION - What are your instincts when producing a song that has already been played a certain way many times? Are you building from the base of what already exists and trying to \u201cput a band\u201d to it, are you recapturing it exactly as-is and releasing that, are you throwing it all out and making a brand new banger from the song, or something else?",

It gives me a kind of fixed reference in my mind which gives me enough headroom for most dynamics. Now the important part is you have to turn up your monitoring/headphones volume to be adequately loud to work with those lower levels and then leave it there.That being said it might be necessary to bring down other pre existing tracks that are too loud.\n\nNow since the volume of the monitoring/headphones stays the same during that tracking session you can use the gain of your preamp (or the output gain of the compressor, if you\u2019re using one on the way in) to adjust the vocal or instrument so that for every part of the arrangement it feels right. So in a sense you are pre mixing during the recording, taking off some work down the line",

    "content": "Love this question, I\u2019ve been on a big panning journey the last two months because I\u2019ve always just doubled things and panned everything evenly. I was listening to an episode on Sonic Scoop about Nigel Godrich\u2019s approach to mixing and it was really eye opening to hear how bold his mixes are. I used to get distracted when something was panned but not balanced but after just forcing myself to do it I\u2019ve gotten more comfortable, and even fallen a bit in love with what panning can do. I\u2019ve noticed I have a tendency to pan instruments a certain way, pianos sound better panned, electric guitars always feel better panned right, no reason why it just does. Find what feels good to you! I haven\u2019t gotten bold enough to pan bass and drums to a side. One day",

For pad, i like to make it as wide as possible because its sound can hug everything else in a space.",

    "content": "My current approach to this involves a couple of principles, but this is the first that comes to mind:\n\n1. If there\u2019s a part with bg vocals performing different lines than the lead and there\u2019s a lot going on, I try to have a spot earlier in the song where the exactly lines those BGs are performing have a moment to shine. For example, if there\u2019s a low energy bridge where they can be clearly understood before the big hook where they can be perceived but not understood as well in the midst of so much. \n\nWhat this does is allow the listeners brain to process what\u2019s being said with little effort, and then later when it\u2019s in a tornado they can still perceive what it\u2019s saying because they recognize it as something their brain already knows, so it\u2019s not overwhelming for their brain to understand the words of multiple vocals going at once if there are layers of lines being performed (usually syncopated) around each other.\n\nThis applies to instruments as well, but instead of intelligibility of words I focus more on cutting frequencies so everything can fit well in the big moments. If they head a synth at full power in the intro and it comes back for a final hook, you can get away with cutting a lot of meat off of it and still have it be perceived as the same synth, without muddying the mix and also creating a nice \u2018bringing the song full circle\u2019 feeling - If the track calls for that.\n\nI typed this off the cuff based in gut instinct so not standing by this message as full proof, but this all feels right to me as I explore what I have done for tracks, without having this much thought or words to it.",

The lead is performing a part that\u2019s trying to overcome anxieties, and the BGs are saying full lines with the anxieties from before.\n\nPanning was essential to create the effect of the anxieties around the lead, but I found that if I introduced them as panned BGs they were hard to make out behind the lead.\n\nBecause of this, knowing when to make a moment earlier in the song to spotlight what would later be panned made those lines more intelligible once they were in the BG to the sides, because the listeners brain recognized it from an earlier section.\n\nDoes that make sense? I can struggle to explain what I\u2019m doing in practice and this is my attempt, so my bad if it sounds like gobrish",

You may be right about the shortening with processing but I\u2019m a huge sucker for no reflections at all. \n\nAlso not really going for a QOTSA rock kit thing which is a lot of what I\u2019m finding. I\u2019m interested in having the hyper tightness of modern hip hop / EDM drums but with the natural textures of real instruments being hit.\n\nWould be even more hyped about finding tablas and woodblocks than rock drums. \n\nI\u2019ll check out the addictive one!",

A pop track I'm producing on sounds great on the ears instrumentally and vocally, but I keep thinking it could have *more* going on to compliment it. Kind of like adding sprinkles onto a cake. However, I go to to explore other elements (extra vocal layers, extra synths, etc.) and it just throws this feeling of balance off. It's probably a mental barrier after listening to what the demo sounds like so much, but at the same time, I think the track could objectively benefit from some filling out.",
