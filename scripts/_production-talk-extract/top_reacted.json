    "content": "As someone who mainlines a *lot* of music on the regular and has been doing so for two decades now let me say that it's a tradeoff. I consider myself to be a fan of music *foremost* and a musician second. Even though I rate being a musician *very* highly. The impulse to make music is secondary to the urge to discover and appreciate it.\n\nTime spent listening to records is time lost doing something else. Whether that's performing music, raising a family, pursuing a career goal, or saving the world. In some senses I think of myself as a very lopsided individual.\n\nLife, in all of it's variety, is too big to get your arms around it all. So don't feel bad about prioritizing certain things to the detriment of other stuff. We can't do it all. Lean into the aspects that you enjoy most and then team up with those who have chosen to specialize in the things that you rank second.",

Generally there is a dominant instrument that the song was written on such as guitar or piano maybe a synth.  Take a filled out productions and mute all the main ingredients and leave the additive colors, only the sprinkles on top. And start rebuilding the production around that. It can take you to an entirely different  universe and provide contrast in the arch of the record",

Name one thing you\u2019ve ever done that\u2019s actually perfect. You\u2019re just scared to move on.\u201d  That story has stuck with me.\n\n2) I\u2019m a fairly decent guitar player, have made an actual career of being paid to do it. And I STILL am either constantly hiring people better than I or recording things note by note and then assembled in protools afterwards. Dr Luke might be the best guitarist I\u2019ve ever been around (and I\u2019ve hung with Blake Mills, Tim Pierce, Phil X), and he CONSTANTLY would just hit record, play the four chords of the song free time, and then cut them up and drop them on the ones or wherever they\u2019re supposed to go in the song. My favorite thing about making records vs performing them live is that on record NO ONE CARES how you got there, just that you did. Unless your groove has something particularly magic to offer I\u2019d get over the one take mentality pretty quick.",

In Melodyne I\u2019ll turn the whole thing and also really pay attention to the timing. At this stage it\u2019s a lot more stretching and/or compressing notes, or more importantly PARTS of words. Like I\u2019ll separate the consonant, and time compress that and bring up the volume so ccchhhhhhhhair becomes CHaaaaiiirrrr. (If that makes any sense). Then back into ProTools. Double check for any weirdness, comp back in the untuned bits you can get away with if you want. Then I\u2019ll do a final cleaning up of group Esses, do my little what I call Swedish time stretching technique, REALLY pocket and polish the vocals.

So I did a bunch of organic shit (acoustic through my 67, some live claps, shit like that), then I threw some kshmr and oliver loops in to just see what the hybrid of classic and modern sounds like. Production is basically done now",

Have chains setup and ready to go for easy grab & go recording. \n3) you don\u2019t need as many elements in the recording if each sound/performance is excellent on its own. \n4) Chase the joy. Some elements are nuts & bolts, but if you find the joy in each part you\u2019re working on, that shines through performances. \n5) remember that not everything needs to be done in a day.

    "content": "Cian's advice is good. It's hard to know where to start, so I'll just share three \"a-ha!\" moments that I've had over the years where the reverb sound that I had been chasing was unlocked. Some of these may already be obvious to you:\n\n1. **Pre-Delay Time:** The longer your pre-delay time is the farther away the \"back wall\" of your mix will sound. 120ms pre-delays (which are huge) will give you that Bruce Swedien depth. The longer your pre-delay the less wet the verb will need to be. \n\nA short pre-delay time will \"glue\" the verb to your dry signal, while pre-delays longer than 50ms will \"detach\" from the dry sound and give you a greater sense of depth *and* clarity.\n\nExperiment with pre-delay times of 20 ms, 50ms, 80ms, and 120ms and see what happens. As you try these settings re-balance your verb with the dry/wet knob and see how that changes the feelings of depth, rhythm, and clarity in your mixes.\n\n2. **Panning/Width/Band-Limiting:** Most verbs default to full-width. Recognize that most verbs don't need to be this massive and practice narrowing your tails. The more that you narrow a reverb towards the center the more it will feel like it's extending into infinity towards the vanishing point of your mix.\n\nAdditionally, don't be afraid to focus your verb by rolling off the high-end and the low-end. Verbs contribute to a lot of clutter in a mix.\n\n3. **Slap Echo:** This was a big one for me. The reverb sound that I was hearing on so many of my favorite records (Bowie, Prince, etc) was really just a single band-limited echo blended to taste. Slap echoes tend to live in the 50ms - 100ms delay range. Sometimes that's all that's needed for the feeling of ambience I'm seeking and it takes up *way* less space in a mix.\n\nOnce you master that you can start blending your slap echo with your reverb tails and the combination will give you a very expansive sound with minimal fuss.",

Everybody knows what to expect and what is to be expected. \n\nProfessionalism. The room is clean, mics are up, lighting is right, session is loaded. \n\nIntuition. All the artistic/personal things. Making the artist feel safe enough to be dangerous, knowing how hard you can push them to get a take, knowing where the line is between their vision and yours, etc\u2026\n\nSonics. I want my artists to feel expensive when they\u2019re recording, so getting the mic and cue mix right is everything. \n\nSpeed. A comp up by the time they\u2019re done tracking, a quick shine to make it feel special, and a bounce for them to take with them.\n\nEverything else is on a per session basis. I can deliver a fully mixed/tuned vocal and everything in between, so it all depends on communication ahead of time.",

Think Andrew Watt handled the vocals on that and did a fantastic job getting the take out of Luke. Dance Hall Days by Wang Chung is always a good reference. Mercy Street by Peter Gabriel (the whole SO record) pretty unfuckwithable. Bang Bang is always a great reference because you can really show a singer the difference between a Jessie J and an Arianna.

I think as producers one of the biggest parts of our job is to be a grounding presence and a support for artists who can sometimes have pretty wild swings. But we\u2019re artists too in our own right with our own bipolar tendencies. In a way that can create an empathy bond between us\u2026we can understand the manic exuberance of making an amazing thing and how there\u2019s usually a pendulum swing in the other direction to compensate. But I kind of think our job as producers is to have our shit together enough to buffer that bipolar thing and make a sanctuary where an artist can feel at home. Just my random thought for the day.",

While he talks a lot about listening and \"ways of being,\" that's not what makes a great producer. That's his personal application. What people miss is when he says \"we work on the project until everyone involved thinks it's as good as it can possibly be. If we don't all think that *it's not finished*.\"\n\nPhil Spector's version was \"it's finished when *I* think it's as good as it can possibly be.\" But it's the same fundamental thing: across the finish line with highest possible quality.\n\nTaste but with a relentless will to execute at the highest level.",

    "content": "Aside from the usual discussion about headphone preferences and HRTF, I\u2019ll give you my experience with them.\n\nI bought them a few years ago with the intention of just having a baller set of headphones for a bunch of travel I had coming up. I had tried them once at @oaklandmatt\u2019s place and wasn\u2019t super impressed... just thought they sounded like hyped headphones. But I really wanted something with killer noise cancellation and something to potentially reference Spatial mixes. After purchasing, the more I used them, the more I fell in love with listening to music on them. I realized quite early on that there was a lot of parity between how things sounded in the APMaxes vs. my PMC 6-2s\u2026 similar low end presentation, similar high end. But just genuinely enjoyed listening to music on them.\n\nI was traveling for thanksgiving last year and a last minute mix opportunity came up for some video game trailer. Not my normal speed but they were up shits creek with a deadline and the money was good\u2026 so I mixed the whole thing start to finish on my laptop with the Airpods. I was a little sheepish about sending off un-vetted mixes, but the clients loved it and I saved the day. I curiously took a listen when I got back to my studio after the holiday and was very surprised that the mix was 98% there. There was maybe a small low end tweak I could\u2019ve made, but by and large, the mixes translated incredibly well. \n\nNow I use them much more for odd tasks, usually revisions and printing sessions. I can be on my couch on my laptop running files down with transparency mode on, still hanging with my family while watching a show, and lock in with noise cancelling when I need to focus.\n\nFor $600 they\u2019ve been a massive value-add to my work flow.",

In an effort to increase transparency they actually messed with the high end artifacts we actually dug, and were using the plugin for (on a lot of the Luke records I worked on we were using melodyne for tune and AutoTune for tone). I clearly remember sitting on the phone with Antares brass for HOURS while they tried to convince us the new version was \u201cbetter\u201d and me having to explain to them that it wasn\u2019t and we were now traveling with rigs that had the old version because the new version just didn\u2019t have the sound we needed.
