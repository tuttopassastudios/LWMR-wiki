In my experience it\u2019s 50/50 whether they want tuned or raw, comped or all the takes- etc. \n\nThe key things that keep me getting called are, in no particular order:\n\nCommunication. Everybody knows what to expect and what is to be expected. \n\nProfessionalism. The room is clean, mics are up, lighting is right, session is loaded. \n\nIntuition. All the artistic/personal things. Making the artist feel safe enough to be dangerous, knowing how hard you can push them to get a take, knowing where the line is between their vision and yours, etc\u2026\n\nSonics. I want my artists to feel expensive when they\u2019re recording, so getting the mic and cue mix right is everything. \n\nSpeed. A comp up by the time they\u2019re done tracking, a quick shine to make it feel special, and a bounce for them to take with them.\n\nEverything else is on a per session basis. I can deliver a fully mixed/tuned vocal and everything in between, so it all depends on communication ahead of time.",

The timing didn't work out because he had a newborn and was leaving LA, but I *did* get to sit down with him for drinks a few times. \n\nThe big moment for me in those discussions was realizing that I was never going to be a great pop music producer *in addition* to everything else that I wanted to do. There are people out there who are 100% bought-in to that idiom and are going to absolutely smoke me because they *love* it. My takeaway was that in order to excel you have to lean into the things only you can do because no one else cares about them as much as you do and no one else is prepared to put in the same effort to see it realized.",

    "content": "So obviously starting with the right bass is going to get you 70% of the way there, but you know what *really* surprised the hell out of me? The *strings*. \n\nIf you're not getting anywhere close to the tone that you want, start exploring the wide world of bass strings. I had overlooked this simple thing for ages. I took my choice of strings for granted because I never had to change them. And when I did it made all of the difference in my tone.\n\nI've always been a Fender guy: P-basses and J-Basses, and the DI signal was always voiced way too dark to pop out of a mix without some heavy lifting. Granted I also use flatwounds (which aren't as zippy as roundwounds). \n\nAfter some research on the TalkBass forum, I ordered a few different sets of flats to experiment. One such set were the *Thomastik-Infeld Jazz Flats*, and ho-lee *shit*. There it was. There was the sound I was looking for.\n\nThey were voiced way lighter in the bass, which gave me a far more articulate midrange. Like the sound of an upright bass which (trust me) is a very good quality to have unless you're going for a grindy metal tone. As it turns out, the midrange is where *all* of the action is in the bass. It's okay if your bass DI is voiced with no low-end, because you can always add that weight back in, but if the midrange is not present to begin with it is an uphill battle to make it articulate in a mix.",

(Once you hear Max Martin sing you can\u2019t unhear him on all those boy band (and even Brittney) tracks. \n\nIt\u2019s such a weird balance of the ego, because as a producer you have to be arrogant enough to go \u201cyour art should sound like THIS\u201d but you have to be humble enough to know when your idea isnt the best one. An up and coming pop band im far more likely to hard tune and really lock in their performances, where as if im cutting a Nels Cline or a Mimi Parker im more apt to go \u201cwell shit, that\u2019s not what I would do, but who am I to try and dictate to you how to sound\u2026 here\u2019s my gentle suggestion and if you say no, cool\u201d\n\nMy general rule is put in the work, then take a step back, take a deep breathe, and try to accurately assess which is better\u2026 that decision you make is REALLY what defines you as a producer. So so so much of what I do ends up on the cutting room floor, but I wouldn\u2019t have gotten to the end result without it.",

    "content": "<deep breath>\nSo, grasshopper, everything matters, and nothing matters. It depends on where you are and where you\u2019re going, and most importantly actually knowing where you\u2019re going.\n\nI view the difference in shitty gear vs good gear as compound interest. A vintech one on one might sound basically like a vintage neve. ALMOST indistinguishable. But if you\u2019re using it on all 149 of the tracks you\u2019re compiling into a pop song, the end result is going to be 149 times more noticeable. The second floor of the leaning tower of Pisa looks pretty spot on but the people on the 15th floor are freaking out. \n\nThat said, I could record a garbage singer through my 251 and my chain, and if I didn\u2019t know what to do with it, it would still be garbage. The flip side is we actually demoed different mics and different chains on Paris Hilton. There was a right answer. And she\u2019s not gonna win any singing contests, but at the end of the day the cumulative effect of all the decisions we made led to tracks that are still being played in clubs to make people dance over a decade later.\n\nDetails matter in not just what the audience hears eventually, but what the artist hears initially, giving them the confidence and headspace to sprinkle in their extra few (sometime more than a few) percentage points of vibe that the audience attaches too later. Fix it in the mix is an abused concept because it doesn\u2019t take in to account the affect of shitty sound or feel on the performance. You think 1 mic doesn\u2019t matter? I\u2019ve heard people sing noticeably more in tune and in time when switching from DAW monitoring to direct monitoring. It ALL matters.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t understand songs, melody, rhythm, and how these things interact to move people? None of it matters.",

    "content": "I've been a \"musician\" since way before i started recording and producing stuff. (Since i was 4 i think). It's such an integral part of how music can feel and make you move. Think about how someone like Anderson paak. can make you dance by just playing 8th notes on a highhat and nothing else(see tinydesk for ref.) or Pino Paladino, will make you break your neck with his bass, playing simple Quater notes. (anything D'angelo).  Even in a genre that is as quantized and on the grid as it gets like a lot of hiphop/trap is, notice how the artist(rappers) that really stand out, are the ones that make those beats really groove/hit because of how they themselves \"groove\" or flow on those beats. They might be slightly behind or in front of the beat, or they might even swing a little. \n\nYou can really get into the micro and macro dynamics of groove. Listen to guys like Led zeppelin, how they might start out a song a few BPM slower than they finish, because of the build up of energy through out the song, and it doesn't sound wrong or unnatural. \n\nA fun thing to do, when looking for inspiration for grooves, is record some foley, and look for naturally occurring rhythms in the sample. Try and build a grove around that probably a bit wonky rhythm. It can really be an eye opening experience once you realise how much fun rhythm and groove is, when you don't have to obey the grid in a daw like a machine. \n\nBut like anything music, it's really about listening and feeling. Really internalising what a forward or laid back snare feels like or a bass thats almost a 16th behind the beat.",

Together they create a single melodic voice.\n\n**2) **How do the instruments stack on each other? Do they clash? Cellos doubling a bass an octave up extend it's timbre into a higher register to make it read better. It's not so different from adding fuzz to an 808 so that it has more presence.\n\n**3) **Which instrument will cut through the music?\n\n---\n\nA few concepts that I'll add:\n\n**4) **Instruments in the foreground vs. the background. Know which part is the lead (focal point) at any given point in the record and then pare down the presence of the rest and push it into the back of the sound stage.\n\n**5)** (Piggybacking off of Felix's excellent post) What is the simplest way to achieve the desired effect? Reduce. Reduce. Reduce.\n\nCut instruments and parts ruthlessly and approach it with a minimalist's eye. Like writing a haiku: How few elements can you use to create an impression? Maybe a guitar part is carrying 90% of the groove and the drums only need to be a kick and a snare. Or maybe the guitar is covering the backbeat too, and you don't even need a snare!\n\nConstantly ask yourself \"What is the most important sensation in the record?\" and then focus it by cutting out everything that gets in the way.\n\n**6)** Hocketing. Pass the melody off between different instruments at different points in the song. Play it in different registers. Combine voices occasionally for special effect.\n\n**7)** Tonal contrast. Dark instruments plus bright instruments. Distorted and clean together. Near vs. distant.\n\nElements that sound same-y will gel together and elements that contrast tonally will pop.",

    "content": "Okay @Nomograph Mastering , so I think the analogy is a little off. Music is a conversation, but it's a conversation between performers. At it's best, the performance is authentic, transcendent, and speaks to our souls in a way that real-world conversation with words can't do. But it's heightened, exaggerated, hyper-focused. If the song is written ahead of time, it's more akin to actors interpreting a script. The words are written, the notes are there. Unless we're talking about jazz improvisation, which is the closest we come to real world conversation, but even then, it's translated and performed. As much as Miles was saying what he wanted to say, he was saying it that way so that an audience would hear it, it wasn't a private conversation.\n\nNow, if you get incredible actors on a stage or in front of a camera, you can let them do their thing with minimal trickery, minimal edits, and it will move you to tears. The respond to each other and elevate the piece beyond what feels possible. Watch that same play as a community theater-level performance and feel nothing. The reality is that a lot of the artists that are coming through aren't Sidney Poitier. They're just not that good at making their music feel effortless. Not every play works as a film, and vice versa. Not every track benefits from having a band in a room. \n\nConfusing the genesis of songwriting (one person crafting both sides of a conversation) with the act of expressing that work (one person performing every part, a la Tom Hanks' motion capture of every character in The Polar Express). I know that ultimately you and I agree on the benefits of humans recording together, but the analogy feels too blurry to me.",

My full prod rate is about 4x my mix rate, but it's been hard to get anyone to pay it, so I've compromised with points. It's a tricky spot to figure out though, that threshold between indie clients who have never spent anything to make a record vs the higher echelon who don't give the invoice second thought, but tend to go to known producers.",

Now stretch this rendered audio twice as long so its in the right octave and right speed.

I think what Rauir\u00ed says about not knowing what we\u2019re doing while we\u2019re doing it is really true, so I\u2019ve just been trying to dissect my process in my brain, away from the computer.  I think it comes down to 2 things for me. \n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n\n1) Choosing Sounds. \n\nIn addition to vibe & genre & emotional intent, each instrument or sample that you pick covers a certain area of the overall picture. Knowing where that part is going to go in the overall arrangement changes how much hi end or low end or wetness (etc.) you want. It also steers performances. \n\n2) Actually Mixing As You Go \n\nOnce a part is recorded, do a quick adjustment so that you hear closer to a finished product. This helps you make better choices about what else needs to be added, (or not added,) and will likely inspire the next step.",

    "content": "Three things come to mind: \n\n1) **Note length and envelope**. That's going to have a large influence on the feel. Electronic producers will spend a *lot* of time sculpting the volume envelope relative to the tempo. Trance producers have entire plugins that give them microscopic control over the pitch and volume envelopes of kick drums.\n\n2) **Presentation and proportion**. Is it up-front or does it sink into the back? It's easy for a 4x4 to feel hackneyed or overbearing. Sometimes all you need is a gentle *pat pat pat pat* to tie things together.\n\nA fresh or unconventional texture will open up drastically different feels. People can dance to anything if it's got a 4x4 click, so it doesn't necessarily *need* to be a kick. You can go far using samples and percussion that sit in different registers, but play the same role.\n\n3) **Complimentary instruments**. If the kick is the \"rock\" then the groove is going to come from how everything else swings over that. What's the friction like between the kick and the other elements? If the kick is a \"straight man\", then the other elements pushing off of it are where the magic comes from.",

    "content": "There's no right way to go about sound selection, but ultimately you have to use your intuition and taste to judge if they're right for the record you're making. If the sounds don't seem to fit, then perhaps you need to ask yourself what effect it is that you're going for in the first place. Why are you trying to put *those* two sounds together? Decide if they get you close to that goal. If not, then simply find another sound. Not everything needs to work.\n\nA lot of it comes down to intention and conviction. \"Wrong\" notes or sounds that are dramatically different can still be pulled off if you play them with confidence and panache. Records are full of sonic choices that stick out like a sore thumb, and we can make them sound coherent with conviction. What might sound abrasive and weird at first can easily become habituated and familiar with enough exposure.\n\nI think almost any combination is valid. There are sound choices that are conventional and there are choices that go against the grain. Every unconventional choice is an opportunity to create a new genre or to create a new mood. It can be a matter of mindset. If you can free yourself from the need to do the \"right\" thing then the creativity to play with unusual combinations will come a lot easier.\n\nOf course, this is all hard to discuss without hearing examples. If you can give us more examples of what you're dealing with perhaps we can be more specific.",

I once worked with an engineer who had a drum machine/sequence set up where he could fade in and blend different rhythmic subdivisions. (1/4, 1/4t, 1/8, 1/8t, 16, etc...) The samples were all shakers and pleasant sounding percussion. It was way more musical than getting pummeled by the worlds crispest woodblock on the quarter-note pulse.\n\nHe said he'd developed it after doing a lot of slow doom-y metal records that grind along at ultra-slow tempos and where the players are playing very spacious but angular rhythmic parts that needed to come in on the \"+ e\" of beat 3 after a 4 bar rest. Stuff like that. Having 1/16t subdivisions alongside the 1/4 pulse was really helpful for the players to come in strong when they needed to catch a really tough entrance.",

In this case the arrangement and the song cannot be teased apart, because the overall musical effect is defined by and dependent on the unique qualities of the arrangement.

I\u2019d also say if the drums sound bad, that can also be a side effect of having everything else in the mix fitting one aesthetic or overall vision, and then having another that just doesn\u2019t mesh. So turning the drums up might help you say, tap into a lofi element you didn\u2019t know was there previously but that might sound great on the record",

Ime I find the choice of 808 (in my genres ) is a trend thing , in the last 3-4 years its pretty much been a progression by producers through perhaps four or five 808 samples .....and when the sample changes its often in alignment with a new programming technique (like new multiple flams ....or conversely, sparse hits etc ) . If you\u2019re searching for ready made samples I could point you to a few places or if you\u2019d like a little pack of the ones I\u2019m referring to in what I said previously ....hmu.

From a production/mix viewpoint....i suppose these sounds themselves hit with such a charcter in the right frequencies that there must be something intrinsically appealing to us that will keep them forever relevant.Im diving back into the Linndrum Clap and the old Jermain Dupri / So So Def claps at the mo for a little diff sonic character .....they are all still in the same ilk as the rolands though. \n\nre: the drill hats.....thats another cyclical pattern there. In the uk thats been appearing and reforming for decades now. its a soca pattern that the uk appropriated into a period of uk garage production (about the same time that 2 step began to mutate into the hip-hop influenced So Solid style )......and then dipped into a scene we had follwing called UkFunky ( a mix of Us House and Carribean influenced drum patterns and bass) .

Analog gear hasn't really progressed much and a pultec/Neve EQ is still one of the best EQs ever for instance. Those records still sound great for that reason. As for punk and hardcore it's interesting: do people genuinely still listen to those records? I've revisited a few old punk records which I used to think were amazing. The songs are great but the listening experience just isn't enjoyable for me anymore, in part due to messy playing  and bad recording/mixing. With bad I mean the playing distracts from the groove of the band and the mixing distracts from the song, where it does not support the dynamic shifts",

I use an MPC, so the lower volume thing would be annoying for my personal use, but that\u2019s an outlier.\n\n3. You could farm out the Battery / Kontakt / etc packs to friends who would be willing to do it or use those tools a lot, that way you\u2019re not stuck making a ton of them (unless you want to of course) \n\n4. I don\u2019t touch loops usually but I know tons of others do. \n\n5. That\u2019s it. Sounds like a super fun and badass project! You should document it on the way on the discord\n\nEdit: I\u2019m speaking to more electronic and supplemental use of drum samples.

They get widely disseminated and integrated into existing styles far more quickly. If a group of teens in Mumbai create something fresh it may be days or weeks before it gets shared with the rest of the world and before other creators start integrating it. Whereas early hip hop had years - nearly a decade, by some counts - to gestate and find itself before it spread outside of New York and was co-opted by the greater world.\n\nI wonder if we've lost something in that tradeoff. We gain quicker access to art and ideas around the world, but we pre-emptively bring these musical mutations out into the daylight before they have time to grow into something unique. Something that is fully formed by it's local environment.",

They just leaned into the artifice of a low-grade camera and built their whole visual style around these simple phone captures of the session.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUyuGjLy4BQ",

I normally never pan that to either side (again being afraid of it sounding too weird) \n\nHope I'm making sense here and looking forward to hearing your perspectives on this!",

I've had guitars recorded loosely toa click and worked the groove around that - lining up the downbeats of the drums/bass  with the guitars even if it's a bit early or late. that was for a more indie type of joint. and for something more trap /modern hip hop, I've nudged bass notes or samples to get them to either sync w drums up for impact  or nudge slightly off to hype of of pull back the energy in the groove. \n\nas far as programming. I'll play with forward swing and dragging notes a lot if I'm going for a more real/dynamic feel when programming. keeping in mind that if the goal is trying to stay \"on time\" any fwd swing that might happen at the start of a phrase will be compensated with some drag  after or vice versa.  keeping velocities in mind w drum hits + linking it to a filter env so that harder hits have more high end and softer hits end up a bit rounder.\n\nadding subtle layers that are similar   to the main drums but occupy a different texture or tone  in dif  sections to thicken up the groove or automate the attack /sustain of certain elements thru diff sections to help shift the listener  focus throughout",

    "content": "(Ok. Now I'm starting to run with this train of thought. Now would be a good time to step off if you've gotten what you need.)\n\nI don't want this to sound like the end-all be-all. One of my absolute favorites is James Brown, and there is no way that some of his songs would hold up to the level of scrutiny I'm describing. And those records *kill*. It's all vibe. It's vibe all the way down, bebe. Not a chord change in sight. Barely a melody in some cases. And that's alright.\n\nSo what did James do? More often than not James would get all of his band (real jazz killers) in the studio and he would sing the parts to them one by one and allow them to input their own feel.\n\nHe'd start with the drummer and have them play a pattern that James was feeling. Once the drummer was jamming on that he would move on to the bass player and sing them an idea. Once the bass player had that germ of an idea they would continue to jam on it with the drummer, refining and adding their own thing. Then James would move on to the horns, and so on, and so on.\n\nWhile James could be dictatorial and (from the perspective of music education) the least technically qualified person in the room he had *vision*. \n\nIf the song has a strong identity you can give your players a good (non-technical) prompt and they can interpret that through their own sensibilities. You can describe a mood, or a scene, or an abstract sensation.\n\nR. Kelly once said (I'm paraphrasing): \"RnB is supposed to feel like the best moment of your *life*.\" That simple description conveys so much about the feel, the pleasure, and the joy that he is looking for in his music. It also excludes a lot of possibilities as well. If you can give your players a prompt like *that* then you can get everyone aligned on the same wavelength and it will carry you so much further without the need to dictate parts.\n\n----",

That's a cool goal.\n\nSo it sounds like part of what you're seeking are techniques to add pitched resonance to samples that may be atonal?\n\nWell a resonator is a great start. If you're not already into it, I'd look into the karplus-strong theorem and physical modeling synthesis. That whole field has a lot of overlap with what you're describing. It's the kind of thing you'd hear Sophie or Jimmy Edgar do with their Elektron Monomachine.\n\n*AAS* have a whole suite of physical modeling products that function similar to *resonator*, but are third-party plugins. Doing percussion synthesis with *Chromaphone* can do a pretty convincing recreation of certain percussion tones with the added bonus of being as flexible as a synthesizer, because it is a synthesizer!\n\nYou could tune a high-feedback delay unit until it rings at the pitch you're seeking. I can elaborate if you need more explanation. Funnily, that's the entire basis for physical modeling synthesizers.\n\nAlternately, you could layer your samples with gently-blended sine tones. That's worth a try too. I know a lot of EDM producers are into this.",

Obviously a positive outcome in one way, but it's the same thing that's scuppered my progress for years (including on ever getting to properly know the OP1).\n\nI was thinking to try emulate some patches from songs by ear. Then there's YT tutorials from the likes of Mr. Bill and other EDM people, they'd probably keep me occupied for a minute.\n\nBeyond that, would you suggest any fun ways to keep myself interested in learning and honing my skills?",

And when I looked at the album credit to find out who the drummer was, I found a producer on the credit. Which made me wonder what kind of a function does a producer in non-vocal jazz records would serve - things like snarky puppy is more obvious but this one is a bit different, it has more organic instruments and some interesting processing on it. I tried to find Jon Brion (the producer of this album)'s contact to ask him about the process but couldn't find anything - but does anyone have any experience producing jazz records? I'm curious to hear what were the roles\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largo_(Brad_Mehldau_album)",

I do like a clear identity in a pack though - for instance, The Kount's sample pack has all those lo-fi/saturated kicks and snares, wonky grooves and crusty hi hats etc that sit very much in his genre, so if I'm reaching for that sound, I know exactly where to go. \n\nI don't know your drummer or his band, but I'd wonder what distinctive character you could capture in your pack? So that I know exactly where to go when I want \"that\" sound in a writing session instant. \n\n\n2) I\u2019m always annoyed that all samples are 0.0db normalized and I always have to turned them way down to keep my gain staging coherent, would I be crazy to have them peak at -8 ? Would people automatically hate it ? \n\nI produce largely in Ableton now, and when you drop a sample in the drum rack, the instance of Simpler it creates defaults to -12dB. With the velocity:volume dial at default (45%), this causes a 0dB sample to play back at -6dB when velocity=100 (the default). My template has all mixer faders (including a basic drum rack + instance of Drum Buss) trimmed to -9dB (similar to my mix gain staging strategy I detailed previously), allowing me to mash stuff up if needed, and still have headroom to not have to max out vocals when it comes to cutting them. What I'm saying in a roundabout way is... I've already made allowances for 0dB samples, so I don't care - but you probably should, because if you're selling on Splice, they could sound dwarfed against the next pack.",

Speaking of gun crime I honestly think media portrayal has a lot to be blamed for in the increase of gun violence between young men. Media portrayal glorifies the kind of lifestyle that people with no choice used to have to survive in. Now a lot of young kids with choice not to join gangs wanna join because that\u2019s where they find the sense of community. People wanna become what they see and what they know. \n\nI\u2019m completely with you on the lil kim style wave- it was cool when she did it, she did it her own way. But whatever\u2019s happening now in the name of women empowerment is doing the exact opposite of what it is meant to do. It\u2019s not my place to really say, but I think it really conformed the path of success for women rappers into a tiny box. Modern R&B and Hip Hop being closely linked together, same with Female R&B artist\u2019s stereotypical toxic relationship songs are also its own box that I can\u2019t seem to avoid wherever I go. R&B at least seem to have more diversity in the type of stories that become heard, hip hop is a lot less like that. \n\nThere are tons of talented women rappers not in that box, but they don\u2019t make it as big nor do people care as much. Kind of frustrating how uniform it has become\u2026 But I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s dead. It\u2019s dead to me, or to you- but it\u2019s still pretty much what people wanna hear all day long.",

I know how to play piano and strumming acoustic guitar a bit. I started to using a DAW in my 14s (FL Studio, yeah I know xD) and in the last 3 years I've been using Logic Pro and last months Pro Tools (just for editing and mixing).\n\nI love to produce electronic pop with a mix between synths and acoustic instruments. I want to be more versatile and confortable producing other genres (genres that I can produce just in my bedroom studio without having a great recording gear). \n\nI'm feeling stuck, I'm trying to listen different genres. I'm feeling very limited because I don't have a great background as a music player or student (my bsc is physics engineering). The music industry is tough and I want to be more confortable to work in other genres.\n\nI tried to be as brief as possible. What advice do you have for this situation? If I forgot to say something, I am free to respond. Thank you for your attention! Sorry about my english. \ud83d\ude42",

Also, a lot of things that have loose rhythm in a way that people tend to love often bother me and sound out of time to me. Jay-Z is a perfect example of this. I spent years thinking his rhythm was terrible before I realized he was doing a shuffle time feel where the amount his vocal is off from the snare creates the shuffle. I just didn\u2019t pick up on that for like\u2026 15 years? And just wondered why nobody else was bothered him being \u201cout of time\u201d.

You could try tweaking the waveform to a slightly different Saw wave, but this is probably as close you'll get with the Serum LPFs and enveloping. You'll need to mess around with pitch bend and attack time to get the performative aspect of this lead line, and especially when you do the pitch bend - you might need some help from the compressor to get the sustain out of that slow pitch bend,\n\nWhenever you hear buzziness it's usually LFO on OSC level on a faster rate. This same lead sound is all over different styles of EDM so it's a good patch to know. Kaskade - Atmosphere has the same lead but in square wave with other layers as well.",

I dived into phoebe\u2019s stuff just last week, funny that it took me 4 year to check out an Amazing album even thou i have been following her on instagram since 2020. What blew me up was, most of the modern productions in the pop side of industry, the sad songs, all of them are inspirationally ripping phoebe\u2019s sound. I was mad at tony berg when i saw his interview where he gatekept a vst they used throughout the album to get that muffled texture. But in the past two days, i also realised he said \u201cWe are not going to tell you the vst just so you at home can not replicate the sound\u201d. I thought that was asshollery until i realised that they are actually being ripped so hard in the industry and that they really gotta protect their sound. Tony, Phoebe, Ethan these guys are hidden unknown diamonds \u201ci think (like me) a lot of people know phoebe as a celebrity than a music artist, or that was just me being lazy to check out her songs\u201d but i feel like everyone needs to experience their music.",

As part of my thesis I'm looking to analyse songs of both eras to showcase if and how they are similar. \nAnyone got recommendations for literature that might help with the analysis of songs in that regard. Unfortunately, I can't just wing and say \"that MJ synth kinda sounds similar to the The Weeknd used on Blinding Lights\".\ud83e\udee0 \n\nAny recommendations highly appreciated!",
