    "content": "Ok, so that's a quick summary of the four main types of comp. My suggestion is to pick one model from each category. One and only one. Forget the rest for a while. Start trying it in various places to get a feel for what it does well and how you can use it to shape sounds, to serve the song. The actual plug you choose matters much less than the intrinsic characteristic of the category\n\nLast thought, 99% percent of what I see online in the form or tutorials etc re compression is nonsense, even from some very good friends of mine. Parallel compression for example can be wonderful, but using it as the only workflow on everything for *religious* reasons is just plain silly\n\nTake your time and spend a week with your chosen plug in from each category. Maybe ask here for examples of different styles in real records, Jimmy Pages' acoustic guitars for example. You'll get a sense for it over a little while\n\nOK, QC time over\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n@Slow Hand please feel free to edit this to tighten it up",

I\u2019m lucky to have a great network of successful record makers here in LA and everyone has stressed about this at one time or another. It\u2019s just part of the game.\n* People can disagree with me here, but I would personally avoid the urge to tell your clients/IG followers/the general public that your schedule is free. Like Ryan said, it\u2019s not a good look and devalues your brand. Not to mention if you\u2019re not one of the people constantly spamming your warez on social media, and all of sudden you are, it might come off strange.\n* Realize that that tides can turn any minute. The phone *will* ring. And when it does, it\u2019s sometimes a plus to have a free schedule and to say something like \u201cjust had a project get pushed out so I can actually start on this sooner rather than later\u201d, etc.\n* It\u2019s also a great opportunity to dive into busywork/maintenance around the studio. Patchbay reworking, gear repair, workflow improvements, computer upgrades. Not to mention keeping up your online appearances\u2026 new website, updating discography, etc.\n* Start hanging out with people. Don\u2019t stay home and bite your nails. You know people making records in your area \u2014 ask em out for coffee/dinner/drinks. Being social eases the anxiety and also reminds people you\u2019re out there in the world, excited to make records.\n\nHang tough, it\u2019ll pass.",

After finishing it and sending it off, I took a moment to reflect on why it turned out so well. (Regardless of the fact that it's a great song, excellently recorded and produced, with a very talented artist).\n\nA big part of it, I realized, is because I'm in such a great place personally right now. I recently moved to a small mountain town with my girlfriend for an indefinite stay, and just last week, we found out we're expecting our first child. The sheer joy and connection to my surroundings are absolutely crucial obviously.\n\nBut this message is to give a huge shoutout to this LWMR Discord. Everything I'm learning here about mixing, mastering, different approaches to work, active listening, where to focus, etc\u2014 it's all contributed immensely. I want to thank each and every one of you who's shared even the tiniest piece of advice or insight. This place is a treasure of great info, and it's genuinely helping me grow, not just professionally but personally too. I truly feel it's making a profoundly positive impact on my work!",

    "content": "Coming up now as a mix assistant to a few mixers of different approaches/styles, I think above all else these days you have to be versatile. I think all mixers inherently have a taste and vibe that they employ in their mixes even if they don\u2019t realize it, and they get hired because of it, but you have to be able to combine your taste with being being that \u201cfinisher\u201d when the song calls for it. Learn when to just push a great rough mix to the finish line and leave the good things alone, but when you\u2019re given dryer tracks be able to mix with a heavier hand and not overdo it (or underdo it)\n\nBut I\u2019ve also learned that the mixers these days who can \u201cfinish\u201d really really well, who can take a 95% awesome rough mix and push it the extra 5% are the great mixers of the modern day, to me at least. That 5% is so much harder than people realize it is, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to learn and study how to do more than anything as a mixer. It can seem like mixers who are given great productions have it easy and just do a couple things and call it good, but it can be so tough to know how to improve an already great mix.",

I think a lot of people have touched on it here, but at least for me there was no \u201cthis blog\u201d or \u201cthis YouTube\u201d, which in some ways is a bummer, but it\u2019s also liberating. Truthfully EVERY SINGLE PROJECT I do, to this day, I learn something new on. And my workflow is just the accumulation of all those different little moments. For instance, this last matt Maeson live record thing, there was a cymbal bleed problem that led me to figuring out how to use soothe on the vocal mic sidechained to the overheads to duck specific frequencies. I\u2019ll use that technique more often from here on out, and I shared it with the group here to maybe help someone else take a shortcut the next time.\n\nEVERY blog has given me an insight or two, even if it\u2019s a Streaky video where I go \u201cwell shit I DONT wanna do that\u201d. There\u2019s a million different water stations along the route of this marathon, rather than one big firehouse around mile 10. \n\nSecond, this thread feels like a good place to remind everyone that mixing is a people business; you\u2019re literally hired to make sure someone is pleased at the end of the process. Learning how to debate/take or givecriticism/get or give notes without coming off as a dick is quite possible the single most valuable lesson. No matter how good your 26hz is if people don\u2019t want to work with you you\u2019re not gonna have much of a career.",

    "content": "Mind if I ramble? I'm working on what is probably the most challenging mix I've done this year. I've been at my first pass for close to 2 weeks, and have probably started it over 4 times. For context, it's a very dense country rock song with like 80-90 tracks, heavy heavy buss processing, many layers hitting exceptional stages of compression and saturation. The most challenging part is that, despite my philosophical differences from the producer's template, the rough mix really works. Anytime I try to strip it back, import my template, do my own thing, make the mix fit into my \"mixing philosophy\", it just falls apart. I've considered stemming it out with Bounce Factory through his template to then put the tracks into my template, but that would be a zero sum game I can already expect to lose. \n\nUltimately I've had to shift my perspective of wondering \"why am I here?\" I'm learning that my role is not to run this song through some proprietary process I take pride in, but to simply just help them reach the finish line by trying to understand and continue within the process they've already deeply baked this song through. I've found that I can apply my perspective while setting my \"process\" aside, and explore what small tweaks or decisions I *can* make that get us the last couple % we might be missing. Any previous approach I've tried I already know would result in a 10+ revision nightmare trying to get back to the original magic of the rough.\n\nAnd on the interpersonal front, I've decided against sharing any of this struggle with the artist. Maybe the mix that gets approved of the 4 that I've done is the one I spent 30 minutes on, but the many hours of me feeling like I'm \"failing\" on the other 3 passes were needed to understand that this track only needed 30 minutes of my time. Excuses don't get us to the finish line. \n\nWhat has been your experience in these situations?",

Work has gotten steadier, projects have become consistently better and my mixes have also grown more and more consistent over the years. I think often it\u2019s easy to get wrapped up in efficiency and templates when at the end of the day we have to remember we\u2019re working on music. Gaining confidence in your taste, in the way you hear music, in the way you want to hear music and in your own creativity can help you gain consistency while giving you the ability to approach every project with it\u2019s own workflow, needs, thoughtfulness and openness. Listening to tons of music helps. Speed comes thru reps and doing tons of mixes. I\u2019m in the minority in this bunch as I largely mix hybrid and I\u2019m pretty strongly anti-template. At least in the world I\u2019m in, each project is so wildly different that while I might have go-to moves\u2013\u2013templates end up holding me creatively hostage. To me, the people that are making the most exciting, inspiring sounding records aren\u2019t necessarily focused on doing it efficiently and repeatably but rather boundlessly and with confidence.",

Great for commerce, kinda a bummer for creativity and art. \n\nSometimes a heavier hand with processing on the final mixbus can help those things gel a bit, to blur those lines. When I got to work with Zedd he said he basically mixes and masters all his own stuff because if you were to take off his mixbus schmutz the whole thing falls apart, and no one else can put it back together to his satisfaction. But he\u2019s basically involved in every inch of his mix from writing to programming to mixing. \n\nWhat exactly are we doing anymore, what are we trying to achieve with the mix. The how is easy.

That\u2019s maybe an exaggeration but the idea is lean into what\u2019s great about digital mixing - save a version, try something new.  If you are versioning there is always a way back to where you were.  Repetition and experimentation will help you find ways to solve problems and speed things up for you down the road.",

When we pull apart ideas, it\u2019s never about pulling down the scaffolding that holds us up, but sometimes things we think are holding us up are holding us back. \n\nAs an example- I was firmly entrenched in the idea that I should be able to great work on shit speakers. Amazing records were made on KRKs right? \n\nA friend of mine, the one who turned me onto LWMR, had better monitors than I had but he was obsessed with upgrading. I told him, in probably kinder words than this, \u201cif you can\u2019t make records on these speakers you probably just can\u2019t make records.\u201d\n\nA couple weeks later, the Grammy winning mix engineer I was assisting told me \u201cehhh, you could probably do with an upgrade.\u201d\n\nThat one sentance ultimately cost me close to $10,000, but that not only paid for itself in time saved along the way, but in the pure joy of making music. \n\nAgain, not suggesting your approach is wrong, just a reminder than being right is less important than learning new shit.",

Some songs/singers it\u2019s immediately obvious and there is often the safe choices that will work but I often think to myself, is this it ? Does it feel special, interesting? Does it feel like it lives in the word of the song and production? It\u2019s a part of the work and I think when you start thinking this way you are really approaching mixing in the right direction. thinking about how it feels rather than how it sounds or what your \u201capproach\u201d is with vocals. For me, I\u2019ve seen over the years that I get faster at recognizing when it\u2019s feeling right and when it\u2019s feeling wrong. And if I\u2019m unsure which is often I try not to obsess over and leave it for a bit and keep mixing. If it\u2019s not feeling right it will continue to not feel right, but sometimes it informs other mix moves that lets the vocal than work, and feel more supported.",

My rule of thumb is lower voicing tend to occupy center-mid, and the higher voicings out wide to create a wider spread. Like if I was making a Queen record, I'd probably stick to your approach because the arrangement would be airtight -- and LCR would work great. But if I was fucking with some indie pop producer that has a boner for a million tracks in his session, then it's warfare and I'm just trying to place things where they work.",

Clearly there's been an evolution to things coming in more fully baked, but recently I had a whole record where the sessions came in fully baked. They sounded very good, were incredibly intricate in how they were layered, and the bus processing was such a massive part of the sound that anytime I tried to build up something my own way, it wasn't even in the same ballpark. I ended up buying every plugin on the clients master bus and 'resigned' myself to small tweaks. I totally changed my approach and it became incredibly liberating... to know that something is already so close to being finished, but spending my time throughtfully making small changes that amounted to a 10-15% gain.",

Make quick moves and jump to something else, if the kick is too\u2026.. it will remind you everytime you listen. Try  to step back and listen to your mixes like a ME. Is there too much or not enough of a certain frequency range?  Then dive back into the micro move adjust and move on. This helps  you stay in the flow and to not get lost  in the weeds.  In my experience the music tells you most of what you need to know. Tempo has a huge effect on how the low end can work. Density often determines how midrange and upper mid/ high freq should work.  The elements in the mix should be serving particular roles and that informs where things should sit and ultimately equal how it makes you feel. I don\u2019t think very much when I mix but I react to what\u2019s in front of me . \nThe more you do this the more this will lock in. Another thing that comes to mind, is sometimes if I\u2019m feeling like something isn\u2019t right I\u2019ll do a save as or In your example I\u2019ll mute the kick and duplicate it and start from scratch and see if I can beat it.

Truth be told, I'll check out the Youtubers' videos from time to time and I'd be lying if I didn't pick up a few things. Because they don't have much, if any, real-world experience, their approach to things feels so foreign. Since they don't know the \"rules\" they're breaking, they occasionally have some wild and interesting approaches. Which can always then be filtered back through a more \"proper\" way of doing things.",

I just had a quick peek at the session and this might have been the last project with my hardware mix bus (UTA MPEQ -> OG UnFairchild V1). Everything came from Ryan very well cooked with his analog futzery and UAD stuff, so lots of coralling with EQ on my end... not much added compression. Looks like the guitar solo went through my old Federal 864 compressor -- which is wild, that thing works on something every 6 months maybe. Some drums went through my old SansAmp pedal. Lots of the guitars got squeezed with my Scully 280s. The whole album has the vocals going through my BG2 -- although this one has some snippets that were ITB... Ryan was constantly tweaking the production throughout the mix process, hence the many versions. A fun collaborative process with a record I still get excited to listen to.",

    "content": "So for this song I was hired to produce and mix it. I got the stems from the demo and did the production in ableton. Then vocals were recut in London and I was sent a Pro Tools session. I always cut and edit in Pro Tools, so I used this session to comp and arrange the new vocals, but then I wanted to just bring it back into ableton and blend with the existing production. So I bounced the vocal from Pro Tools dry  (no verb or delay) but with tuning and some compression and EQ. Then I used some of the demo vocal and some of the new vocal in the final mix.\n\nI'm pretty comfortable committing eq and compression on my vocals (the confidence of years of doing this... ps you should do it more, it's good for the workflow). But if I needed to go back for some reason I could go back to the Pro Tools session. I think I did go back once to remove tuning on an ad lib that was part singing, part talking. \n\nI'm getting much more comfortable mixing in ableton. The only thing that really sucks about it is that the sessions do tend to slow down when there's TONS of vocals with autotune inserts (the equivalent number of tracks and autotune instances in pro tools does not tax Pro Tools nearly in the same way). So thus far the only way that ableton really works for me to both produce and mix in is if I don't have raw vocals in there. Hence, bouncing from pro tools works best anyway.",

Song I was on the other day had horns, vocal, and occasionally gtr were leading and everything else was just supporting (either octaves of the same part, rhythmically the same, or pads on keys). So I got those 3 rocking together without worrying about every track, it was easy to identify the kind of space I needed. I wanted it in the same room as the brass, but really forward on the stage. If I\u2019d had the pads up while trying to do this I was always either too wet or too dry and couldn\u2019t find the happy place. The tl;dr is, if you\u2019re struggling to find a satisfying construction of ideas, you may be trying to treat leading and supporting parts as equally important, and you\u2019re challenging your ear to grab what\u2019s really important at that moment. \n\nAlso in Brauer\u2019s template there are a folder of verbs that everything in the session shares including vocals. So you get a sense of cohesion from that, and the vocals have their own folder of delays that are unique to them. That helps create separation.",

Ego death and learning opportunity \u2026\u2026or construction of a narrative that de legitimises the folks who handed you the enlightenment. My daily safe space is a construction site so I\u2019m probs a bit maladjusted anyways but for me \u2026\u2026if someone knows more than me about what I\u2019m trying to do , they don\u2019t need to dress it up in nice wrapping and give me a cuddle while they demonstrate what a total numpty I\u2019m being  with my approach . I love my supervisor at work , he\u2019s an absolute vet \u2026.he knows everything there is to know about electrics . Days are I\u2019ll ask him a question or suggest a method for a problem and as I say it I realise how ridiculous it is \u2026..there\u2019s a look in his eyes \u2026.he doesn\u2019t say anything and just walks away . Ha ha , it happens to all of us in my firm and I\u2019m here for it . I\u2019m so much of a better electrician for working with him . And we both know he\u2019s making me great \u2026.he\u2019s proud of his trade and from time to time he recognises my growth . And in the meantimes the shit talking the scaffolders give us is absolutely hilarious . I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way . This place is like my work place . I\u2019m so grateful to the mods , they give so much of themselves to us here \u2026.it\u2019s really unbelievable . And I can\u2019t recall ever seeing any ad hominem attacks . As Phil said , this music for a wage  game is pretty brutal at times . I don\u2019t mind it . Steel sharpens steel . I question whether it\u2019s the right area for happiness if getting your ideas handed back to you with a 0/10 is too much to deal with (edit : not that I\u2019ve ever seen a 0/10 response here )",

But generally my approach might look something like this: First pull down the volume by a bunch. Then usually you\u2019ll want to add in some transients back again. I like Spiff for this to taste. Then sometimes Master Rebalance by Ozone can be a life saver. Especially if say the balance of some instruments are clashing with the vocal or the 808/bass is too loud in relation to everything else. Essentially I\u2019m \u201cunlimiting the beat\u201d. \n\nThen together with the vocal in the mix I\u2019ll try to shape the beat around the vocal with some subtle (usually reductive) eq moves. Something like dynamically sidechaining a bell on the hihat frequencies to the vocal can help a lot. Or I might also play with Spectral Shape. Some people get good results with sidechaining the vocal as a whole with trackspacer or soothe. Then if I\u2019m missing some super lows or excitement I might throw a Pultec/Bax-type EQ or Spectre on it. \n\nSo ultimately I\u2019m creating as much space as possible and give myself enough headroom to still do some typical mixbus moves.\n\nTo me this removes the need to do anything different on the mixbus. Even though it\u2019s likely I won\u2019t be able to push as hard.",

The funny thing about seeing them live is that they were always touring on the material that hadn't been recorded or released yet. So you'd go see them on the tour for *Feels* and they'd be performing *Strawberry Jam* songs. You'd go see them on tour for *Strawberry Jam* and they'd be performing proto versions of the stuff from *Merriweather Post Pavilion*.\n\nI always thought that was an exciting dynamic for a band. Especially for them because they're big on performing their songs in a variety of different arrangements. \n\nIt's very playful and I think a great approach to performance that I don't see many bands embracing these days.",

I think it can be easy to get in the weeds with the \u201cMix Buss\u201d  I\u2019ve found for myself that I will try these different techniques over the years for example,no mix buss treatment and only a limiter.  Then I tried the music/vocal buss thing. Then I tried only processing the groups and lighter on then mix buss processing.  What I learned is there is no right or wrong way to do anything  and it\u2019s good to try different approaches out but if you feel you are fighting something it\u2019s a good idea to check the processing and see if it\u2019s tying your hands. The only way I know how to do this is gain match your inserts and turn them on and off.   I\u2019ve mixed with the inflator and had good results,  and it\u2019s also been horrible. I\u2019ve mixed with Vulfcomp on the master (generally a horrible idea  but in certain cases it rules!) I even mixed with altiverb on the mix buss recently.

I\u2019m mixing and mastering, and I have a manager and an assistant. We\u2019re constantly trying to improve our workflow, but some weeks are so busy that it\u2019s hard to keep balance, and I end up overworking.\n\nHere\u2019s my current workflow: I use Asana for project management to keep track of all projects. When something is booked, my manager adds it to Asana, and I assign it to my assistant to prep the mix session for me. Once it\u2019s ready, we schedule it in. I try to do one mix a day (sometimes two..) and then handle masters and revisions for previous projects in the afternoon. But this often gets moved around because mixes or revisions take longer than expected.\n\nFor those of you managing multiple projects, what\u2019s your delivery time like for mixes and revisions? How do you schedule how long a mix will take? How do you decide how many mixes to do in a day while still keeping a clear mind?\n\nAnother issue I\u2019ve been facing is communication. Some artists text me on WhatsApp, others on iMessage, Telegram, email, or Instagram. I\u2019ve tried centralizing to email, but it\u2019s impossible. So I keep all revision notes on the Notes App in a folder to keep track. I try to do \u2018Inbox Zero\u2019 but it\u2019s not easy. How do you deal with managing communications across so many platforms?\n\nSorry for so many questions, haha. I just had a burnout and was a brainless zombie for two weeks. I\u2019m trying to optimize so it doesn\u2019t happen again \ud83e\udd74\n\nAny tips, tools, or advice would be super helpful!\n\nThanks so much! \ud83d\ude0a",

It\u2019s the psychology behind it that I think can get you into the market better than a blind\u201d hey I\u2019d love to mix something for free for you sometime\u201d if that makes sense ?",

    "content": "As a mastering engineer, I\u2019ve kept my monitoring level consistent for the past ten years\u2014at a relatively low volume. This isn\u2019t a rule, just my approach, and I do it because I know exactly how a finished track should sound in my room at that level.\n\nEvery system has a sweet spot, and if you can identify that in your setup, you\u2019ll get more consistent results. This ties into factors like speaker and amp combinations, how your speakers push air\u2014especially in the low end\u2014and how they perform at different volumes.\n\nMany speakers don\u2019t reproduce low frequencies accurately when played too softly. On the flip side, when pushed too hard, speakers often cap the low end, meaning the bass stops getting louder while the mids and highs continue increasing. This is common in everyday listening setups\u2014people crank their systems beyond their limits, causing an imbalance where the top end dominates.\n\nThis is one reason why working with a mastering engineer with a well-calibrated setup can be beneficial. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s only one way to do things\u2014some engineers work in less-than-ideal setups and still get great results. It all comes down to what works for you and gets you the sound you like.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s important to remember which i amsure you already know.... your ears perceive frequencies differently at different volumes\u2014this is a well-documented, non-linear effect. The way we hear balance changes with loudness, which is why understanding how your room and speakers respond at your chosen listening level can make a huge difference in achieving consistent, reliable masters. If you crank it... \"memorize\" in your ears how it should sound cranked. Then when you drop down to another level..\"memorize\" how it sounds there. You should then find a few spots you can use.",

I've been having pretty smooth results since 2020 like this:\n\n\n- Get clients on headphones (unfortunately a necessity for feedback/delay reasons, but I'm finding a lot of times that's how they listen to most music anyway, so they're very familiar with their headphones of choice). \n\n- Have them open your Audiomovers link.\n\n - Start a Facetime/Zoom call on your phone with whoever needs to be there. Mute your own Facetime mic on your phone, but clients leave theirs open. They'll hear your chat via the talkback mic you've set up in Tools.\n\n - Use talkback mic routing as pictured. If you're a Pro Tools nerd, you can probably work out what's going on by following the routing and sidechain assignments in the screenshot, but:\n\n\nI print mixes and the limited ref (usually just tickling Pro-L 2) at the same time, so I make a Pre-Fade send to the Audiomovers bus from my Mix Print channel. This is also where the limiter lives, so their Audiomovers feed goes out at a healthy level.\n\nMy talkback channel (usually a 57) has a ducking compressor on it, sidechained from the Listen Print send and set to stun. This means my TB mic gets (more or less) muted during playback, so I can work on speakers while I make their tweaks. Muteomatic is still in my template, but I think I opted for the sidechained compressor because delay tails etc were getting double piped down to clients through my mic the moment playback stopped, whereas the compressor has adjustable release so it can come back up more or less as the tails die.\n\nIf any of that doesn't make sense, just lemme know and I can amend this post.",

I set up auxes and route stuff to them that will be a stem, so it\u2019s part of the prep process (i.e. route Lead Vocal to Lead Vocal Aux, Keys 1 to Keys 1 Aux and so forth), so choose what you will for the song and split up however much you need to. Then I use sends (or you can multi-output) to respective audio tracks and name them (you can also include Instrumental, TV Mix and A Cappella as their own audio tracks). Record-enable all the audio tracks, record them down. Then use Soundflow to copy the mix buss plugins you need (Copy Track Data macro), copy them to all the audio tracks, then use Track Bounce to offline bounce all of the stems in one go, and it will include the plugins. Takes about 10-15min.\n\nThe only caveat with this is that you have to route any effects to the same aux, like Lead Vocal Verb has to go to Lead Vocal Aux and nowhere else, so you can\u2019t share effects.

Maybe I will try this and see about the results!\n\nCorollary is I find that stem \"mastering\" is honestly the worst of all the worlds, for me it would be either the standard stereo file master or give me the session. Which I would approach with a mastering mindset, accepting things for what they are and listening big picture.\n\nAlso I've come from producer/mixer land and being new to mastering in late 2022/2023 really...I am sorta less attached to what mastering \"is\" in the philosophical sense.\n\nI often think of mastering as just making the song better (to my taste and ear) within the almost arbitrary restriction of just having the stereo file. Of course this ignores the mindset of approaching a full project! Which is a huge part of mastering. \n\nBut as you stated, with how technology is evolving and the ease with which we can send stuff, may change. Excited to see where it goes!",

This let me instead trim up the shells post compression to the same effect. I then messed with just the oheads & crotch feeding the detector to see if the kick and snare was making stuff too pumpy.\n\nI\u2019m still wrapping my mind around this technique and I\u2019d be curious to hear some of you guys weigh in on how you\u2019ve found sidechaining effective in a live drum buss format!",

You start to hate \"that idiot producer\" when you put on the mixing hat, haha. \n\nIf time/deadline allows, sometimes it's nice to take at least a day away from it to mentally separate if possible. Another thing is to treat your production session like you're prepping for an external mixer even though it's yourself in this case, i.e. commit everything and drop it in to a new session. That's maybe overkill, but sometimes when you need a fresh perspective, starting a fresh session like that can help separate the work you've already done w/the work you need to do. \n\nAfter that, be ruthless in your assessment of what's actually needed and not (just like you would an outside mix session you got in from someone else). Is that 3rd synth really needed? Maybe the 4 guitars are too much when only 2 are really needed, etc etc. It's of course important to honor the work you've done already and the *reasons* you did X and Y in any given session, but also revisit those \"why\" reasons and see if you can accomplish those original goals/feelings with a simpler approach if you've ended up with a super-layered thing.",

So whatever\u2019s a part of the busses /subgroups adding up to the stereo mix should be left on. \n\nThe reason why: Most of the time they\u2019ll use the stereo mix in my experience, but if something like a shaker or lead synth is wailing away under a dialog moment, or something like a boomer is messing up a sound effect, they\u2019ll bust into the stems to mute those conflicting elements, but they\u2019ll want the song/mix to generally sound the same. \n\nSo for sync stems, they may have deliverable specs already, so doesn\u2019t hurt to ask, but if not, I always try to put myself in the mind of an editor and approach stem splits with the idea of \u201cif it could be distracting, it gets its own stem.\u201d Generally, aside from basic inst groups, I\u2019ll split out high perc stuff, boomer/swooshers/lifters, any leads/solos, and of course vocals always get split lead and BGVs as separate stems.",

Maybe multiple midrange elements will be competing, but the ear can only focus on one at a time (in addition to the drums, bass, and maybe vocal) so YOU choose and shift the focus!\n\nMy second approach is to take two or more of the competing tracks, say kick and bass, and play them together. No point in soloing one. EQ one while listening through it to the other. You may notice that you can subtract quite a bit from the bass without losing its character, but the kick\u2019s punch is improved by the space you\u2019re carving out. I do this a lot with vocals, too\u2014focusing on the vocal inside a dense mix while subtracting from all the other stuff that\u2019s stepping on it. When the lead just finds its home in its own uncongested space, you know you\u2019ve got all the surrounding noise right.",

I recently wrapped up a slightly unusual 3 year \"experiment\" on myself.\n\nFor various reasons, I decided to narrow down variability in my life and rely heavily on routines. It wasn't scientific at all - the journals wouldn't touch it - but I set up a structured life with the same waking and bedtimes each weekday, similar exercise routines, identical breakfast every weekday at 8am (quantities measured), the same salad (Greek, since you asked) every weekday at 1pm for 18 months (then I switched to a tuna salad I liked and stuck with that for 20 consecutive months), and one of four batch cooked dinners at 6:30pm that I would rotate roughly weekly.\n\n[I've started typing this and I'm realising I'd need to spend far more time than I have right now to demonstrate the depth of my findings and their Nobel prize eligibility, so I'm just going to wrap it up semi-flippantly]\n\nSome takeaways:\n- When stuff started sounding bad to me like clockwork at 3:50pm every day, I knew it that it was not the mix turning sour - it was just time to eat my 4pm apple. The sugar would kick in, and hey presto, we're back in vibe town. Removing variables can be helpful in diagnosing issues - the diagnostic problem solving approach one develops as a studio assistant can, to an extent, be applied to ones self.\n\n- Limiting variety mitigates decision fatigue and frees up quite a lot of brain power. I like to think of myself as a less dead Steve Jobs - he wore polo necks, I ate greek salads. We both got a lot done.",

Most of the template is just effects busses and print tracks for various pieces of outboard, something to make it super quick to paint without having to make and label everything from scratch each and every mix. Never usually having presets for individual elements but if I\u2019m working on an album sometimes I\u2019ll \u201cbuild the sonic world\u201d for one track and make a new template for that to import into the sessions moving forward as a bit of a time saver. Tweaks come track to track and record to record, always building new templates specific to the records I\u2019m working on. \n\nIf I\u2019m mixing on the console that kinda becomes the template or preset, I\u2019ll work on a track and build the mix, sit with the client and work revisions and then move onto the next track. Stemming the new track back over the same sorta map on the console and tweaking from there. \n\nI really try not to make anything to \u201cone size fits all\u201d because you can end up really fucking yourself but it can be nice to have little time savers. You just have to check that it\u2019s making the situation better each and everytime you use them. If it\u2019s not, don\u2019t be precious start from scratch and you\u2019ll get much better quicker results that way.",

Because , they will have a fluctuating phase relationship with the other sounds in the mix that I\u2019m just leaving up to the plug in . This seems a bit reckless after all the cautious phase choices we would make for a mix ?

The deadline isn\u2019t particularly tight so I had the leisure.\n\nI think depending on where you are in your career, it can be really helpful to use someone else\u2019s mixing philosophy as a learning tool, but if people are coming to you for what you do, client projects are probably not the time for that.  \n\nIn my head there\u2019s a pretty big difference between exploring a new reverb plug to potentially generate some inspiration and deciding, \u201con this project I\u2019m SIDE-CHAINING EVERYTHING\u201d when that hasn\u2019t been your thing in the past.\n\nBut also, I don\u2019t really think about this that much, and I think you\u2019ll probably have to develop your own feel for what\u2019s appropriate for you.

In my case I almost always use dry  lead vocals to start.  If people are very particular. I tend to bounce blends, such as a BGV stack or string or horn stack. In particular if there is arrangement automation. I\u2019m not trying to re do what they already like. But if it\u2019s not working for me I\u2019ll re do it. I have a template that has my busses routed and then I get organize and color code. Small sessions take about 15 mins to  prep and bigger sessions about 30 mins max.  If I can I prefer to prep before I plan to mix incase there are any issues with files ect. Sometimes I have an assistant doing it for me. Then I go to town",

There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

I believe Serban still uses the ML4000 on his mixbus. Would be surprised if it\u2019s doing much though. JJ same story \u2014 he really goes in with Multiband on Vocals too. Other people might just use it to tame a specific frequency range instead of EQing it. But since dynamic eqs are a thing that\u2019s gotten less popular I guess.",

    "content": "That's something I can agree with forsure. Clipping often gets disregarded and people will often reach for compression, saturation or even limiting before they reach for a clipper. It's indeed important to use it where needed tho, I see it as just another tool in my toolbox, but I will use saturation or compression when I feel like that's what the sound needs. Good to hear that it's not just about mindlessly throwing clippers on everything.\n\nApart from that I think doing anything to dynamics is always better if done in stages. Different stages of compression, limiting and in this case clipping, so I definitely think that's a good approach",

I have no idea how to get distorted guitars to sound so distorted but not harsh on the ears simultaneously in such a big soundscape....sonically it reminds me of early drum n bass pioneers like photek, Dillinga and optical for sound design.

    "content": "That is true, but I think a good mix still sounds bad in target \ud83d\ude05 and I\u2019ve been in enough bars and restaurants that have playback systems that sound worse than my iPhone in a bathroom only playing out the left speaker. \n\nAnd people will still say, \u201comg I love this song\u201d and start bouncing their head.\n\n I believe that great songs translate every and anywhere. But fidelity cannot IMO be appreciated in these specific places. \n\nOfc there are exceptions. But try eating at a restaurant on a beach promenade in south Spain and the restaurant next to you has a speaker 20 inches from your head blasting a different song. And tell me you think the vocal is warm or the drums are punchy. I think, sadly for general non music fans what they find in music, is less quiteness it\u2019s not even about the song. \n\nWhereas I think the people who enjoy music, will appreciate that extra punchy drum sound or warm vocal and deep bass. And I believe those people use headphones 80% of the time. They might have a great speaker system at home. But how much time do we really have at home listening to said speakers? Headphones are with us on the go all the time. Everyone I know under 30. Listens primarily on headphones. Or their iPhone speaker. Sometimes a JBL at the beach or park, and every now and then a party speaker at a party while drunk. The ones who really really love music, either have an old vintage speaker set from their parents or a Sonnos/smart speaker type thing. \n\nI still believe mixing for speakers is important, and @Nomograph Mastering has a great point in speakers translating to headphones easier than vice versa. But I always make sure shit sounds amazing on my AirPods. I\u2019d rather sacrifice something in the speaker than the AirPods. But then again. I don\u2019t have the accolades you do. So I might be shooting myself in the foot. But that is my general philosophy.",

This would leave you with a visual reference of what you did and where.\n\nThis would be too heavy handed for your work, but a similar workflow using RX connect - sending trouble spots over to RX, then rendering them back into Pro Tools - would leave a similar visual document of the processing. Maybe you could have playlists for each process.\n\nMaybe not practical in reality, but it seems like one way to attack it.",

Some EQs (e.g. API) perhaps lend themselves to additive work because the proportional Q is super wide at +-2dB and sometimes people think of subtractive EQ as a tool for more narrow resonance notching, and it's a bit unfamiliar to have -2dB with a Q of 0.5 or whatever.",

Usually means keeping it on the board for a few days while people chime in with their input. Usually the band will be on board with this workflow and understand that part of the magic of this workflow is to commit to things and make decisions quickly. I was working on a console with automation, so that was useful for fine-tuning a mix by modern standards\u2026 but not impossible with static faders.\nB) Have enough I/O and set each console channel as an insert in Pro Tools. This was the hybrid workflow that really worked for me. It was also the gateway to integrating outboard gear. When something needed the console treatment, I\u2019d add the insert, get it vibing in the mix, and then once I was ready to print a pass, I\u2019d commit all the inserts in real time. The session was getting summed in the box and everything came up perfectly for recalls. This was a great way of getting the sound and workflow but staying sane in the modern record making world.",

Get the ideas out as quickly as possible. I understand that. I used to use templates myself. I still do to some degree by using the same tools over and over that I\u2019m comfortable with. However, what I\u2019ve gathered is that there\u2019s a reason people spend their entire lives learning to mix. It\u2019s another form of art. It takes experience. I don\u2019t think everyone is being harsh. I think they just want to lead you down the path that\u2019ll benefit you the most in the long run. What I learned from my time doing a similar experiment is that it didn\u2019t work for every song. Every once and a while, it might fit the vision, but it also boxes you in. And the thing is, that leads us back to the original problem which was to focus on creative freedom. This is coming from an artist who has done almost exactly what you\u2019re trying to do. You can do it but I promise, these guys are just trying to save u from a headache. Just stick around a while, and the knowledge you will gain will be tremendous I assure you!",

Maybe that's because I'm mostly working in the live instrumentation / drum kit space where I'm basically trying to lessen the 20 dB+ of dynamic range on a kick or snare or drumkit at large.

    "content": "Hey everyone, so a couple months ago I went to a workshop with one of the guys who worked on the loudness standard team for the european broadcast union and it was really interesting how he thinks about all that and how it translates to his mixing workflow in particular. So for those of you who don\u2019t know in broadcast you have to hit a loudness of -23 LUFS +-1dBTP throughout the program. This is especially tricky with live program as you can imagine. But having this fixed loudness target also has a major advantage, it\u2019s that you can have a fixed volume setting on your monitoring and with time you kinda know how loud you\u2019re mixing compared to if you\u2019re mixing for peak loudness, where you\u2019ll always land on different loudness depending on the program. This was the first time I really understood the advantage of that way of working, because with time you\u2019ll be so tuned to the loudness target you\u2019ll be able to really intuit every move. And since -23 gives you boatloads of headroom you can really push things during mixing and then still get the density through clipping/limiting after that. It kinda ties in with what @Nomograph Mastering  was saying about fixed monitoring level. What do you guys think about that?",

The way I approached it was to build the mix with loads of headroom, then when it was all sitting roughly where it wanted to be, I\u2019d alt+drag the input/output of Saturn to wherever it sounded good.

There\u2019s probably arguments to compress pre saturation, but I auditioned compression before and after Saturn and preferred it post on that occasion, so that\u2019s how it stayed in the template.\n\nThe Pro-Q curve hedged against a tendency I had/have to mix too smiley, and all in all it seemed to make things sound more gooder so the duo lived on in my template\u2026 until it didn\u2019t.",

Such a quick workflow.

So I'll give you my general observations and y'all can take me at my word.\n\nI dropped the input signal to -20dB and then played around with boosting at 100Hz (where my test tone is) to see if the harmonics were different for different EQ band types. I tried a *bell*, a *low shelf*, and a *tilt shelf* to boost.\n\nI was able to boost it +16dB in both *subtle* and *warm* mode before I got any of that harmonic breakup that we started to see in my previous tests as we got approached -0.03 dB. It appears that distortion on *subtle* mode (once again) doesn't kick in at all until the output signal gets within -4dB of 0dB on the output meter. The *amount* I boosted did not matter. The distortion only came when the signal crept close to 0 on the output meter.\n\nAll three band types appeared to behave the same when it came to harmonic bloom.\n### tl;dr:\nI did not detect any difference in behavior with different EQ band types. So they appear to behave the same. It's looking like the breakup doesn't kick in until the output level of the signal is within -4dB of 0dB on the output meter. *Then* they start to break up.\n\nThe only exception is the 1st order harmonic at -22dB that appears as soon as you enable *warm* mode. That's always present, no matter how hard you're driving it.",

It\u2019s a modular multi effect plugin, and making a few different presets on it allows me to quickly switch around between different colors and modulation. It has random parameter set feature and can unexpectedly bring in interesting sounds quickly too. Other than that, I also like Soundtoys stuff for phaser and tremolos, ubermod for chorusing and other phase effects on the delays. For reverb, Dverb is actually pretty cool especially when it\u2019s mixed in with delays. I like Valhalla vintage verb and eventide ultraverb as well. And for post verb or delay saturation, decapitator and spectre. Saturn if I wanna use the dynamics control on it. I also like messing with the polarity, sometimes flipping it can get the presence of the tail heard better without obscuring the dry sound as much.",

The actual knowledge Manny and others at the top of the game have to share is what I relayed and summarized before: understand music deeply, understand artists deeply, and deliver on their vision. Technique discussion is fun, but I don't think anyone here considers this podcast a \"mixer secrets exposed\" type of forum. There are plenty of shitty YouTubers spewing that content.",

A bad room can really make it painfully hard to make confident decisions that translate in the moment or even later in mixing.\n\nTemplates to me speed up your workflow not necessarily help you make better decisions if that makes sense. It\u2019s like, setting up several busses you ALWAYS make, so instead of doing 100 keystrokes and commands to get your busses and FX built, two clicks and they\u2019re there for you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what genre / style / level you\u2019re working at, but I\u2019d say just keep working at it. I love recording music because you can ALWAYS do it again. Time is the only thing you have to lose. With enough time, anything is possible. \n\nThat said, looking at a frequency analyzer of a whole mix you like isn\u2019t a horrible thing to do. Maybe you\u2019ll see your mix is way too dark, or way too thin simply.",

It is smart, and for his workflow it\u2019s also fast and easy.\n\nI use compressors a lot, but I\u2019m also working in mostly indie rock with acoustic drums and bass guitars not 808\u2019s and drum machines, which is a drastically different world. I also think I\u2019m doing what most people don\u2019t do and I don\u2019t always love the artifacts of compression so I generally use slow attacks to maintain transients and fast releases to recover quickly (I adjust so that I get the fastest release before audible distortion)\n\nBTW Bruce Swedien while he may have evangelized not using compression don\u2019t underestimate that his greatest works were done to tape and even when you were conservative and didn\u2019t hit tape hard, the transformers going into tape and out of and the tape as a medium itself would peak limit attack heavy instruments like drums",

And those decisions are hard to make until I\u2019ve heard the song and can see what stems I have to work from. I\u2019ve just gotten too many sessions from people where there is so much bussing and subgrouping going on that by the time the vocal gets to the mix bus, it is passed through 3 instances off gullfoss and 4 different compressors and there is zero life in it. It quickly gets out of control. I actually find minimal bussing to be a quicker workflow because I don\u2019t have to follow a whole series of subgroups to know the entire processing chain on a given audio source when I\u2019m trying to make a tweak, nor will that tweak affect any other element that is sitting just fine. That\u2019s just my brain though.",

So I tend to have better results addressing EQ inside the mix first rather than beginning the mix with some preset curve that is likely to work against me.",

So the flow state is maladaptive but the analytical approach is stale (and super unfun as the mixer). Am I the only one with this dilemma?",

    "content": "I can relate to this . I think first impression notes are a great tool and I\u2019m challenging myself to \u201cdo less \u201c not more to roughs:demos . Often times when I\u2019m tracking vocals it is to a two track (rnb/hip-hop) and I\u2019ve learnt that just about any \u201cvocal sound \u201c I want to go for I better get it whilst we are tracking because the artists always want a rough vocal mix to go away with at end of session . Invariably , whatever that rough sounds like I can\u2019t stray away from (for good or bad ) once they\u2019ve heard it . And then when it comes to a final mix , it gets even more complicated getting the actual stems for the two track and mixing it all down with the vocal tracks as it often (imo) sounds better but doesn\u2019t feel the same as that on the day rough vocal mix to the two track . I realised there\u2019s no way I can get an artist to unhear that first  rough mix and I\u2019m wasting hours mixing it all over again with the stems , like I\u2019m re inventing a wheel no one wants . I\u2019ve noticed @Bainz_  telling @oaklandmatt he had the same issues with thugs punk album and also have heard Jason Goldberg and Stuart white embracing the idea that you\u2019re possibly mixing the final mix/pre master as you track . It\u2019s a very raw and quick approach and it does keep you miles away from overmixing something . I embraced it as a workflow only recently and it\u2019s less stressful than working your ass off on a \u201cperfect\u201d mix only to get back they prefer the vibe of the first day mix .   top tips not to overmix I am meditating on currently are : don\u2019t lose your dynamics , watch your phase relationships don\u2019t change , leave some mistakes in , automate more than compress and be quick",

(I hope you did a short square wave blip at the beginning and end or @BatMeckley might come after you and your not sample accurate multitracks \ud83d\ude05)\n\nYou said you got your vocal mix in protools and then pulled it into ableton, for practical reasons. Does that mean you bounced the wet vocal and just had a vocal track, and mixed the beat around that or did you bounce the dry vocal and recreate your chain from protools, so you\u2019d still be able to tweak it in ableton? Curious about this workflow, because I like yourself also always produce in ableton, and record people outside of ableton.",

You can use DSP plugins while tracking with this high buffer size and have low latency. \n\nThat said, I was doing 24 track recording at 128 buffer size on a mac trash can (64 gig ram) with native plugins with no issue. Then i started working at the studio I\u2019m at now and it\u2019s an older mac pro and we have an apogee symphony with HDX, so I utilize that workflow there: using only dsp plugins and having the buffer size high.

So people may find more comfort in \"do this, do that\" or \"this is the solution\" approach but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not compatible. It just needs a bit of encouragement to see value in finding one's own answers to things, which I think contributes to us having more patience to sit with the questions. \n\nBut conservative tendencies seem to be a trait that is more on the inherit side of the spectrum. And conservative tendencies make it a bit difficult to accept having one's view, lifestyle, habits in thought processes shaken up by an open question with no definitive answers.",

Probably a weird one, but I think I'm missing something.\nI've been looking into SSL Bus comp schematic \u2014 there are several going around the internet and based on what I see in SSL 500 unit are quite interesting in a way how the sidechain envelope follower is generated.\nThere are several approaches I see in various models:\n1. Original SSL mixes left and right channels with OR principle \u2014 basically the envelope is generated based on the strongest signal coming from either L or R channels. \n2. Some of the models suggest mixing left and right channels \u2014 essentially you get the average signal between channels which is then generates into an envelope.\n3. True stereo (or rather dual mono with a single set of settings) \u2014 which calculates envelopes for the left and right channels independently.\nSome SSL comp models have a switch to trigger between various modes, but if I understand correctly, none of the SSL original models have used true stereo (fully independant) sidechain processing.",

Since I'm getting pretty wide splits from the mixer, I'm able to save him the hassle of my tweaky notes and once the sonics of the track are nailed down, he sends me stems and I can do my stupid \"this flute phrase should be a bit louder,\" \"this guitar is more important in the blend than the piano here,\" etc. It keeps the mixer focused on the big moves and I spare him an hour per-cue of my nitpickyness. \n\nWe have a lot of trust, though.

I have \"corrected\" the asymmetrical waveform using phase rotation in rx. Is it common practice to use phase rotators/all-pass filters to make these waveforms more symmetrical? or do these things do more harm than good? what are your approaches to this?

I mixed the whole thing in one Pro Tools session, with a separate set of channels for each song which I\u2019d then make inactive and move onto the next song. When printing the continuous mix at the end, I\u2019d make active two songs at a time for any overlap, and constructed the long printed mix like that.\n\nIn this case though, there are multimiced drums, bass, electric guitars, keyboards, vocals. The recordings are good (from the stereo board mixes I\u2019ve heard) and the scale is such that I want to have the fidelity I\u2019d approach a studio record with, and the room to shape an identity for each song (while still sounding like they all happened on the same stage on the same night) so I\u2019m thinking to use my usual elaborate drum mix routing with parallels etc, all the bells and whistles.\n\nThis complexity would put me off mixing 23 songs in one session, but I\u2019m thinking of the inevitable crunch at the end of the project and the potential frustration of jumping between sessions.\n\nAm I thinking too deeply about this? Should I just get a drum sound and leave it there for 23 tracks, with a few rides here and there?\n\nNot much experience with this stuff so any thoughts would be very welcome please!",

At the moment I usually import everything and then go through each track flipping polarity on one side or sometimes with a vectorscope. And will then split to mono accordingly and delete the extra channels and adjust volume if necessary and it feels like a pretty inefficient process. Was wondering if anyone uses something like  StereoMonoizer or has a better option. Also curious if it even matters. I find something inherently wrong about seeing a kick drum mic on a stereo track but I currently work completely in the box and other than giving me a minor headache when I look at it, I can't tell if there's any real downside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is now also making me think more about bus settings. I typically default to stereo busses but am wondering if I should use mono ones for mono sources (for example when I use a folder/bus to combine snare top and bottom or kick in and out to a single channel). Again, probably doesn't make a meaningful difference but curious what you all do. Thanks!",

I'm trying to up my game both when it comes to recording and mixing. \nMy instinct when it comes to EQ is to subtract. In a way, it feels logical to me. Let's say I don't like the sound on a snare around 400hZ. Then my brain goes - let's remove that. \nI've been digging deeper lately into the API style of EQ and it occurred to me that when going through the preset list -  most of the presets were doing additive stuff. I find this very interesting and when it comes to \"surgical sounddesign\",  a new workflow for me. Like - I don't like the low mid on this snare. Let's boost the top instead. \nIt feels somewhat backward but I can see some good things coming of it. \nHow's your workflow?",

My question is this: Should I mix these records like they're an album cut (read: loud/hot) or should I approach the mix knowing that there's going to be available headroom in the TV audio mix?\n\nIt's been my experience that loud/squashed records end up sounding puny in TV programming because the broadcast mixers turn it down.

So ,im ditching gullfosses and soothes and spectral shapers and MB's..and im breaking my buses out to h/w mixers and boxes so that i can hopefully induce some electromagnetic phenomena or some \"accidental\" errors , like  my two year old coming in and turning knobs on the gear without me seeing (as he does) and then i mix through it , unknowingly....and ive introduced something wrong, something a perfect alogirthm could never give me ....something........difffffferent. Im v. bored atm with listening to perfect productions and mixes. Imho they are delicious and tasty and  malnourishing like McDonalds.\n\nImho, the sound of  Robert Johnson recorded, singing crossroads in a shack somewhere a 100 years ago will still outlast the bombastic incredibly perfect production/mixes i feel encouraged to mimic today. i feel like perfection has been overdone at this point. Lets f things up\n\nit might be a naff idea but , where im at....since doing band stuff....that tom elmhirst quote about there being no perfect mix....and the mix is the mix that happened at the moment where eevryone in the room agreed was it......and not to be touched again...this is what im fascinated with at the mo....and doing the print with me and the drummer on my current mixes pushing the analogue faders (with the busses stemmed out of the daw) together.

I like how it sounds, it\u2019s very subtle but it does the thing where it sets the whole mix in front of you and you can separate sounds more easily. Kinda like when I turn on oversampling on a limiter or clipper, where you get less peaky distortion. While that is great on the other hand what I notice is that transients get less \u201cvisceral\u201d, like putting over a blanket or something (really hard to discribe I find). How do you guys feel about that? I\u2019m honestly a bit lost with how I want to approach it, cause I see the benefits but also I\u2019m not sure about the trade offs",

This happens to me from time to time, not always that extreme tho.\n\nGenerally my first move is to listen while bypassing each thing and trying to identify what it\u2019s making better and what gets worse, then if I decide to try and keep some of them I\u2019ll attempt to move some of those plugs off the main mix buss and back onto a subgroup or instrumental buss. But no matter what it ends up with me looping sections and rebuilding the mix to match the rough vibe before I get into the actual creative fun part of the mix.\n\nI have one producer i work with often who mixes into a comp on his all vocal buss and it\u2019s slow and hitting like 3-6 db compression. It totally bones me while mixing so I usually end up rebalancing all the vocals section by section to match his mix before I \u201cstart mixing\u201d. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll just work into their buss shit and bypass the stuff/bands of each of plug that are only hurting and not helping. \n\nReal can of worms tbh. \n\nLast week I ran into the vocal buss issue- luckily it was a comp w side chain input so I did try out the sidechain, I pre fader sent all the tracks feeding it while copying automation to that send, then used a master fader to match the buss sc level to the original comps gain reduction  and it worked well in that situation and untied my hands while saving me from a whole vocal rebalance session. First time that approach ever actually worked though for me tbh. If its a comp that drums are driving into i find the sc input doesnt end up feeling the same usually.",

For some, tuning out the noise and just getting to work is the ticket. For others, it's hoovering in everything and sifting through it all to assemble it into something until you have your own. Part of me wants to say that tuning out what everyone else is doing and developing your own approach might save you a lot of unnecessary banging your head against the wall trying to fit square pegs into round holes.

Lately I've been using a reverb instance for nearly every channel (or group) because it allows me to really carve out hash-y buildup that's unique to every instrument.

I get the impression that people are using far fewer verb instances and therefore doing a lot less EQ'ing.\n\nAlso, what's your philosophy on the number of verbs? Are you doing a unique verbs for each element, or fewer (2-3) verbs that get shared across every element?",

Then I drive it through the free TSC 808 plugin for further emphasize the harmonics the bluey brings out. (EQ too)\n- Then, I use Audreio on the master to play the mix through my phone instead of my monitors. Once on the phone, you can blend the parallel with the bass in a way where there\u2019s little to no audible difference on a monitor, but the illusion of a bass can be heard through the harmonics playing on the phone.\n- It\u2019s a balancing act, but there\u2019s almost always a nice sweet spot to be found where it doesn\u2019t change the quality of the sound enough to be intrusively perceived on HD speakers, while giving life to the bass on lesser speakers.\n\nThis has helped my bass translate to more systems, and is the only time I find myself wanting to use the CLA76.",

To be fair my question was very open ended since in reality I'm also just wondering how to approach a vocal chain and vocal production beyond simply copying a preset or blindly adjusting settings on various plug ins. Something like an eq, or even other things like saturation or simple sidechain on a reverb is simple enough to somewhat understand, but the culmination of various settings and layered effects does start to get complicated and a bit unintuitive.\n\nI think fundamentally I need more attempts and practice struggling on my own, but I also think it's helpful to see if at some point I can find a bit of guidance or collaboration to accelerate my learning and focus my vision and efforts more efficiently. I appreciate your response and will try to not overthink it and focus mainly on leveling the bars to taste and moving on to practice some tuning on the vocal after. Thanks again !",

In a typical scenario where you want body and sub from kick out and snap / beater from kick in, do you avoid doing any high passing or low passing to maintain the phase relationship?\n\nAdditionally I've been trying to listen and see what the tracks bring to the table before jumping to conclusions, but generally have an expectation that kick in will give me snap, while kick out will give me body. Trying to avoid that one size fits all thinking though, so I'm curious how y'all approach it!",

As I said, a lot is about simple volume shaping, but that doesn\u2019t always give me what I\u2019m after. For example, how that octave layer trick translates to kicks. If I have a kick that I want to feel snappier on top, could I duplicate it and pitch it up an octave, or would that mess with the mid/low end? Or is it more about lifting the top with EQ to bring the transient forward? That always feels a bit strange when it\u2019s pushed too hard, so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right approach either. Just curious how pro mix engineers handle it.",
