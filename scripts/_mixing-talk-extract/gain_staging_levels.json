    "content": "I went to art school and its entire foundation was built on the process of critique. You learn to tear the work down as a means to burnish and gird the ideas. I learned very early to not get so emotionally attached to my work because there was very often ample headroom to keep pushing the ideas further and ultimately get the work to a more realized and better state. It has been my experience having worked in a creative field beyond music and painting for over 25 years, that the people who are most successful, welcome and embrace critique and don\u2019t get sent down an unproductive path when their ideas are challenged. It can be very difficult to hear that what you thought was a good idea, might not actually be. As creative folk, we have to find ways to separate how our sensitive nature absolutely helps us and at times, gets in our way. We needn\u2019t be so precious about things, especially if holding on holds us back. \n\nI\u2019ve found being very direct without beating around the bush is a way more effective means of communicating and leads to better places more quickly. It is a skill to learn to operate alongside people who won \u2019t sugarcoat their feedback in pursuit of better outcomes. The earlier one can learn how to thrive within that framework, I think the better off you will be.",

It's more that everyone is chopping, clip gaining, and RXing to an evenness that softens and linearizes performances. \n\nThese tools work beautifully when shitty mic technique makes things boomy, or there's a few weird ss's on the pre-hyped TLM mic through the focusrite pre.\n\nBut it sounds like most people who learn the tools are overusing them like crazy. \n\nI'm trying these days to get off the details and try as much macro-mixing as possible.

Yours sounds huge.\u201d\n\n\nBasically what I did, besides level & panning, was carve out a bunch of like 400 in all harmonic elements. All the tracks sounded good, but the density was all bunched up down in that range. \n\nAs I was explaining it to him, I had a moment of clarity about headroom. Doesn\u2019t matter if all frequencies are present for a big and tall mix, if all the headroom is getting eaten up by everything hitting the same frequencies, the collective volume of that is gonna make everything else feel quieter. \n\nI usually think of headroom in regard to low end and transients, but it\u2019s true for every part of a mix.",

If something is loud at the very beginning of a section, then comes back down in volume, the ear will perceive it to be loud for the section. So quickly automating drums + cymbals, big piano chords, guitars, etc -- just for a moment -- will go a long way at making sections exciting. I'm also a fan of slowly lowering the volume of certain instruments right before section changes to give the perception of loudness and excitement on the downbeat.",

Especially if you use a resonant peak on the filter. As far as phase shift\u2026 whatever. If it sounds good, it is good!

But generally my approach might look something like this: First pull down the volume by a bunch. Then usually you\u2019ll want to add in some transients back again. I like Spiff for this to taste. Then sometimes Master Rebalance by Ozone can be a life saver. Especially if say the balance of some instruments are clashing with the vocal or the 808/bass is too loud in relation to everything else. Essentially I\u2019m \u201cunlimiting the beat\u201d. \n\nThen together with the vocal in the mix I\u2019ll try to shape the beat around the vocal with some subtle (usually reductive) eq moves. Something like dynamically sidechaining a bell on the hihat frequencies to the vocal can help a lot. Or I might also play with Spectral Shape. Some people get good results with sidechaining the vocal as a whole with trackspacer or soothe. Then if I\u2019m missing some super lows or excitement I might throw a Pultec/Bax-type EQ or Spectre on it. \n\nSo ultimately I\u2019m creating as much space as possible and give myself enough headroom to still do some typical mixbus moves.\n\nTo me this removes the need to do anything different on the mixbus.

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

    "content": "As a mastering engineer, I\u2019ve kept my monitoring level consistent for the past ten years\u2014at a relatively low volume. This isn\u2019t a rule, just my approach, and I do it because I know exactly how a finished track should sound in my room at that level.\n\nEvery system has a sweet spot, and if you can identify that in your setup, you\u2019ll get more consistent results. This ties into factors like speaker and amp combinations, how your speakers push air\u2014especially in the low end\u2014and how they perform at different volumes.\n\nMany speakers don\u2019t reproduce low frequencies accurately when played too softly. On the flip side, when pushed too hard, speakers often cap the low end, meaning the bass stops getting louder while the mids and highs continue increasing. This is common in everyday listening setups\u2014people crank their systems beyond their limits, causing an imbalance where the top end dominates.\n\nThis is one reason why working with a mastering engineer with a well-calibrated setup can be beneficial. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s only one way to do things\u2014some engineers work in less-than-ideal setups and still get great results. It all comes down to what works for you and gets you the sound you like.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s important to remember which i amsure you already know.... your ears perceive frequencies differently at different volumes\u2014this is a well-documented, non-linear effect. The way we hear balance changes with loudness, which is why understanding how your room and speakers respond at your chosen listening level can make a huge difference in achieving consistent, reliable masters. If you crank it... \"memorize\" in your ears how it should sound cranked. Then when you drop down to another level..\"memorize\" how it sounds there. You should then find a few spots you can use.",

Sometimes it\u2019s also helpful to find a spot for a final element or two I\u2019m trying to shoehorn into a dense arrangement\u2014but for that I usually just pull up Spectre and push frequencies around until things sound good. (The instance of Pro-Q3 is for seeing more fine detail, and Insjght I\u2019m just using to measure loudness.)",

I've recorded not-so-great rappers through nice chains and mixing wasn't the answer to save a (lacking) source. It never gave you *that* feeling. But even if you are recording great rappers cheaper mics tend to lack body and rarely have \"boostable\" or pleasant top end as you said. So it's a bit complicated before you even get to \"mixing\". Felt that was important to mention so you're not too hard on yourself.\n\nBut assuming that the limiting factor really is just mixing there's a bunch of options. First things first: is your monitoring and listening environment decent? Or are you on headphones? This could make placing vocals even harder for you. \n\nThen do you have a process that starts with vocal cleanup to get rid of or reduce unappealing harshness or performance issues? Despite being simple, people tend to skip basic tools like clip-gain to even out a performance. This should usually also give you some leeway for strategic boosts. Maybe instead of EQ look at harmonics. Fresh Air by Slate is free. Gem Dopamine is nice. Spectre is great. All of these should give you that \"sizzle\" you might be missing.\n\nThen to get the presence and even out the performance you could try some parallel compression with something like an 1176. Also, try out Multiband Compression with the Mcdsp 404 or C6 or whatever you have to control the performance throughout the song once you've got a vocal sound you like.\n\nI also find mixing the 808 & drums together with the vocal the most useful when it comes to gain staging and getting the song to feel right.\n\nObviously, there's more that could be said but I find processes more helpful than tools. It's art at the end of the day. Attached what Serban's assistant sees as their/his \"mixing process\". Mix more and experiment with what you have. Get feedback from the artists.",

This allows the limiter to examine the incoming audio in advance and predict the amount of gain reduction needed to meet the requested output level. If the look-ahead time is very short, the limiter doesn't have much time to move to the desired level: this will generally have the effect of preserving transients better and increasing the apparent loudness, but at the expense of possible distortion. Longer look-ahead times are safer, but less loud, and transients might appear to get lost in the mix a little more.\u201d",

Cue into what your reference mixes sound like in tidal on hifi with normalization off. Route that into your DAW with a virtual output and you can compare LUFS on your favorite meters. The truth is there are no standards and trying to beat/cheat every loudness algorithm is folly. Make good shit that sounds like your favorite un-normalized records. \n\nSomething else I have done, grab some CDs from a local library of your favorite records and put those wavs into a meter or RX and see what the pros are actually printing out loudness and peak wise.",

That should soften some of the peaks that will end up gnarly once munched through multiple limiter stages.\n- I've found I can get there much easier by driving a lot of density in the analog stage.\n- Parallel processing can give you extra density and perceived loudness\n- De-ess again if you have to\n- One chain I've found great success in is: StandardClip after the analog stage into the Weiss Maximizer then into the ProL2. That has gotten me very clean and very fucking loud masters, but that is post an analog stage that is built for high headroom to drive serious level in the analog domain.",

Handy tools for starting points if you need them.  Some handy spectral tools to quickly change the color of the limiting that you may or may not find useful.\n\nCons - eats a ton of CPU, so much so that I tend not to use it even though I do prefer the sound for some things.

Maybe that's because I'm mostly working in the live instrumentation / drum kit space where I'm basically trying to lessen the 20 dB+ of dynamic range on a kick or snare or drumkit at large. Shaving off 6 (or more!) dB of transient on a played snare drum still leaves you with a pretty transient rich snare drum. But I'm still curious about use cases...",

    "content": "Hey everyone, so a couple months ago I went to a workshop with one of the guys who worked on the loudness standard team for the european broadcast union and it was really interesting how he thinks about all that and how it translates to his mixing workflow in particular. So for those of you who don\u2019t know in broadcast you have to hit a loudness of -23 LUFS +-1dBTP throughout the program. This is especially tricky with live program as you can imagine. But having this fixed loudness target also has a major advantage, it\u2019s that you can have a fixed volume setting on your monitoring and with time you kinda know how loud you\u2019re mixing compared to if you\u2019re mixing for peak loudness, where you\u2019ll always land on different loudness depending on the program. This was the first time I really understood the advantage of that way of working, because with time you\u2019ll be so tuned to the loudness target you\u2019ll be able to really intuit every move. And since -23 gives you boatloads of headroom you can really push things during mixing and then still get the density through clipping/limiting after that. It kinda ties in with what @Nomograph Mastering  was saying about fixed monitoring level. What do you guys think about that?",

Ive tried just turning it down by 1.3 dB, and that made the loudness penalty software give out a higher reduction value.\nI know it's probably not possible to get it to 0 but does anyone have any idea what I should do here? Haha",

    "content": "Loudness question: I\u2019ve been struggling with drum samples and bass/808s specifically. A lot of these sounds come in so dense and compressed, they sound good in level close to 0dbfs but they don\u2019t have the knock and energy they had when they are turned down to create headroom. Especially when it\u2019s playing with other instruments that are more dynamic. A lot of times they even sound smaller and thinner too. So I\u2019ve attempted using samples that have taller peaks but at the end of the day I end up doing similar treatments (distortion, clipping) to get the level of density and aggression. Which also leads to another question about transient treatments. I\u2019ve watched tutorials on this topic and some people used clipper to have the limiter work less, and the others work slightly differently by preserving the peak and using parallel to create density. I tried both ways, but still left me with the issue of not being able to crank it louder without messing things up. With the dense drum samples, the rest of the mix would start choking every time the drums hit. Generally I find it so much easier to get things to compelling loudness when there\u2019s no drum instrument (I find percussive elements with higher pitches easier to fit in the mix). How can I work around this?",

If you\u2019re gonna go for the modern sound but still record acoustic instruments, tweezing out nasty resonances with EQ plays a big role\u2014no way they could do that with 1073s.

If you\u2019re liking your limiter getting you to -8 LUFS or whatever, it\u2019s still going to sound how you want, just transparently quieter. \n\nThe ONLY time loudness matters IMO is when you have broadcast specifications for advertising. Otherwise make that shit sound as good and loud as you want, let the chips fall where they may. As Long as it isn\u2019t quiet you\u2019re going to be in good shape.",

A bad room can really make it painfully hard to make confident decisions that translate in the moment or even later in mixing.\n\nTemplates to me speed up your workflow not necessarily help you make better decisions if that makes sense. It\u2019s like, setting up several busses you ALWAYS make, so instead of doing 100 keystrokes and commands to get your busses and FX built, two clicks and they\u2019re there for you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what genre / style / level you\u2019re working at, but I\u2019d say just keep working at it. I love recording music because you can ALWAYS do it again. Time is the only thing you have to lose. With enough time, anything is possible. \n\nThat said, looking at a frequency analyzer of a whole mix you like isn\u2019t a horrible thing to do. Maybe you\u2019ll see your mix is way too dark, or way too thin simply.",

(i'll rewatch when they post it back up)  Its this cutting / scooping of the high mids (up at c.1-6khz) that ive never heard much about before, Im interested because i dont like crushing my mixes to get a higher lufs and if this is an effective way to get their smoothly im v interested in learning more....im happiest with my mixes at -12 lufs but will push to -9 ....but id like to get to -9 with as little sacrifice to the fidelity and low end as poss.\nIve also heard recently (I think i heard it from colin leanord talking) something about the trap guys always scooping out the  second octave harmonic   of the bass ? c. the 110-130hz region....Is anyone familiar with using this? (eg.  the  \"missing fundamental\" and all that good stuff)",

(its confusing). @Eric Martin  Im going to have to hunt some info down re: Lufs weighting and the algorithm to learn how to manipulate this approach i guess",

I dont use compression for dynamics control either....you may have heard of the \"clip to zero\" strategy? i do a similar thing but then output my limiters/clippers at -6db instead of 0. Its similar to what johns doing just catching peaks and not squashing the life out of everythin....mike dean does it too IIRC. \n\nRe: spectral shaper : I didnt actually spot jon using his spectral shaper in that 1-6khz region, i saw it in the low mids....so having heard you and @oaklandmatt both mention it ...it seems hes defo already using this high mid scoop trick then! Ill still research the maths of the lufs algo because i like to really understand the psycho-acoustics and science of these sorts of things. Im after the ultimate mix in this life, lol .....i come from underground club music, where drums and bass and a sweet vocal are everything so its a constant balance/re-balance between lows/mids and highs as i learn more advanced techniques\n\n..re: jons mix yesterday and clipping, and you mention clipping the attack portion of a sounds adsr , did you notice how much he uses transient shapers on almost everything? v clever. Personally, i love transients and fight hard to keep them and jons trick of putting a transient shaper after a clipper/limiter has been a revelation....(thanks @oaklandmatt , that gem came from your LWMR) .....bruce swedien said compression is for children, and i believe he evangelised about not killing transients ...i love a transient shaper and a clipper ....compressor , not so much.",

Quick question for y\u2019all. \n\nI was listening back to the gain staging episode, and I believe that was the one where Jon talked about keeping your pro tools faders at unity for fidelity reasons. He explained that adjusting them will affect the quality of things quite a bit. First time hearing about it, and couldn\u2019t find much more info about it. Would love to hear your guys\u2019s thoughts on that idea. Just thinking about not using faders makes me sweat. \n\nApologies if this has already been discussed!",

It feels like 101 level stuff at times but if you\u2019re not forcing things to mono and isolating ranges, you\u2019re not forcing yourself to make the real big EQ strokes.

    "content": "A hard clipper will behave differently than the digital clipping that occurs when you clip your converters or when you export a signal that exceeds 0db at a bit depth of 24bits. Your daw works internally at 32bits floating point, which means that your individual faders will have a lot of headroom above 0 db, so you can go pretty much as high as you want with them, as long as you turn the signal down in a later stage before it hits the final output. Otherwise you will be clipping your converters like you said. This clipping will be different for every converter, and it's why mastering guys buy converters that are worth more than your car, just so they can get a certain flavour when clipping their a/d (although I'm pretty sure most have stopped doing this, because it often just sounds like shit lmao). Clipping your signal with a plugin will introduce different distortion/saturation/artifacts. It will even be different between different plugins and between different algorithms inside of those plugins (if you are able to select those)  (some clipping plugins actually use the exact same algorithms, so those won't have any differences ofc. EDIT: the only differences here would be in the oversampling functionality etc. of the plugins used, not in the actual clipping algorithm. There actually aren't a lot of hard clipping algorithms out there, so most differences between plugins will be in the way the anti-aliasing filters work)",

You wouldn't ever want a singer to want to only sing in one specific octave because it gives the song a higher LUFS measurement. Lets the mixer and and ME worry about loudness, and let the singer be creative and sing what they feel, how they feel they can create the biggest connection. I Think its the same with a mix engineer, let them mix it to their best ability and creativness, and let the ME worry about the last QC, before sending it out to the people.",

Izotope insight has a very good spectrograph that clearly reveals what\u2019s happening down at 20-30 hz and how much energy is there . We ve also discussed izotope tonal balance here as well , but it\u2019s really a very handy diagnostic when used to investigate where your low end energy is against a referenced track you like . Izotope Match eq is another tool that again allows you to compare and contrast what\u2019s happening in your low end . I\u2019ve also found the Shawn Everett trick mentioned here , useful for investigating low end (put a brick wall low pass filter on your mixbus and sweep it down to the 20-30hz with your subs on and see what that actually sounds and feels like . The other thing I find helpful is my gain staging and buses are set up so that I know how much gr and level should be arriving at each bus , so you soon know if you\u2019re too hot just by looking at the comp / limiter . The last thing I\u2019d say is know your speakers . I apply all this to myself because translation is my main point of focus right now . I forget where I heard it said , but I heard it said that the listener hears the inverse of what we the mixers hear .",

I\u2019ve tried limiting my drum bus, but it takes extreme limiting on the drum bus to have an effect on mix bus limiter (and I don\u2019t totally understand why). I guess I could try limiting drums/bass together, as maybe it\u2019s a phase issue with kick and bass adding together (talking live drums here, not programmed)\u2026 but any thoughts here are appreciated. \n\nSecondly, what range of limiting (aka -2 to -6db) are you guys doing on mix bus to have your overall mix at around-9lufs? I have been trying to only hit -2db of limiting on peaks for most of my mix, but have a really tough time accomplishing this and loudness. I love heavy/punchy low end, so maybe that\u2019s why.. \n\nI guess I have this idea/goal in mind that I should be able to make -9lufs mixes that are punchy with a lot of low end, while only hitting 2db of limiting, but it seems impossible. Is it?",

But IMO you don\u2019t want to rely on the limiter as a way to achieve loudness or excitement in a mix because you\u2019ll likely end up with a crushed muddy mess\u2026 The limiter is not very good at those jobs.\n\nAlso LUFS is perceived loudness meaning EQ plays a huge role in that.. Distortion / Saturation plays a big role..  \n\nSo limiting should be one slice of the pie when it comes to achieving level\u2026 the rest should be done within the mix with the correct EQ moves .

Focus on getting the EQ targets dialed in with your mix, and the input target not clipping..  This taught me SO much about loudness.  My mixes consistently hit -9rms and -9 lufs when I get them dialed with EQ, and I no longer get the \"smushed\" feeling I used to get when trying to get loud. The mix actually breathes and is loud AF. Then when I get the eq targets dialed in, I see where I am hitting large amounts of peaks over 3-4db on the limiter, and then I address those peaks at the source in different ways. The God Particle I truly think can be a teaching tool, as well as a great sounding mix bus tool. I am now using it less and experimenting with my own chains. But seriously, this may help you as it helped me. The GP does not suck and I will always have it in the bag as sometimes it is just the right sauce.",

If you know where the sweet spot of a compressor is on a drum bus for example, you can calibrate 0 on the VU meter to that sweetspot. then mixing into your compressor isn't such a guessing game every time (because you get the needle bouncing around 0, not too far under or not too far over). \n\ni use a digital one on the way out when i'm hitting my analog chain so everything goes out at the relative same level. i use an analog one on the way back in calibrated to a \"safe\" level and i know when it's coming back in ultra hot or i need a little extra gain to get it to the sweet spot. when you're monitoring stays at a consistent level, VU meters can help you judge relative relationships quite easily. i could see it being useful in the use case you described if you've calibrated the VU accordingly. say you want to generally hit -10 at the mixbus...calibrate a -10 signal to 0 on the VU. everything you then feed into the mixbus will show on the VU + or - where you want to end up.",

    "content": "Re ITB vu meter use I remember someone else describing using one on their mixbus pre limiter I think , in order to help watch the overall tonal/ energy behaviour of the mix ., I think his point was that generally the vu meter responds in a more musical way to dynamics (and transients ) than a digital peak meter as it responds with a timing and frequency related factor \u2026. Which is more similar to how we hear . So he uses his VU and then a peak meter. I\u2019m probably totally paraphrasing the sense out of his technique tho lol , so I\u2019ll find it also and put them both in here . Got some mixing to do today but defo this weekend",

The VU meter to highlight how the mix is behaving pre-limiter :\nVU (Volume Unit) Meters essentially display an average of what we hear, rather than the very fast peaks that we don\u2019t. they will show you the energy in the low end, and if there is radical movement, then you probably have an issue with frequencies that you aren\u2019t hearing.VU meters should \u201cdance\u201d smoothly and in a gentle manner, usually in time with the music, rather than in big jumps and erratic, out of time movement.\u00a0 This erratic movement implies that there are drastic level changes, which will be hard to control in mastering and need addressing in the mix.  \n\n2. The LUFS meter post limiter to set your loudness levels\n\nPersonally, i dont use this MO ...i like izotope tonal balance to monitor the mix but....just wanted to share what i rememmbered about people using vu ITB",

    "content": "I use an Analog VU meter on the output of my monitor controller built by the inhouse tech who also worked at Neve (he designed and built the 8816 summing box) - he recommended the Sifam ones because their ballistics are really good - which I think is the main argument for analog vs digital. I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

I've heard that very often brass instruments like trumpets and also male vocals can produce these sort of waveforms.\nI'm working on a male vocal pop ballad and the vocal is quite asymmetrical, i'm concerned this will mess with compression and limiting and the overall loudness I will be able to get. I have \"corrected\" the asymmetrical waveform using phase rotation in rx. Is it common practice to use phase rotators/all-pass filters to make these waveforms more symmetrical? or do these things do more harm than good? what are your approaches to this?

In simple terms, the Inflator is a special kind of distortion generator which has no dynamic activity over time. It's a static process. It gives the impression of loudness by providing the harmonic cues we associate with loud and stressed sounds, increasing the harmonic density of the material in a way that is sympathetic to the ear.\n\nThe Oxford Limiter's Enhance function is a special kind of 'dynamic' process that does not add distortion to steady state signals. It works over time, programme history, peak and average levels and left/right stereo differences to limit the signal and squash peak events, while providing the listener with the impression that the peaks are still there. It can sympathetically remove peak events so that you can provide more transparent limiting, or make the programme even louder without causing sample value overs.\u201d",

    "content": "And from the manual:\n\u201cThe enhance process improves the perceived loudness and presence of the programme material by modifying the dynamic and harmonic content of the signal. Since the method used is different from the Pre-Processing section, it can further enhance the perceived volume of a previously processed signal, while suppressing all signal overloads. As the limiting action does not involve conventional sample value clipping, harsh distortions are avoided, and programme detail and dynamic information is largely retained.\n\nAlso, since the plug-in has internal headroom, transient levels greater than notional maximum modulation can pass from the Limiter section into the enhancement stage. This means that percussive overshoots, that would normally be lost in a conventional limiter (or would give rise to overloads), may be included within the sonic results of the plug-in, producing both richer dynamic sonic detail and a useful reduction in the perceived artefacts of the limiting process, all without giving rise to any sample value overload.\n\nThis property enables slower attack times to be used in the Pre-Process section, without creating output overloads, which would otherwise result in a need to reduce output levels.\u201d",

    "content": "...im aiming for the dynamic range between the moments where the kick and bass hit seperately...to when they hit together....to be my low end dynamic overall (if that makes sense)....so i dont want to flatten that range there....and instead prefer to compress the kick and bass seprately on their own buses . Im using parrallels of my kick and bass to get my loudness and harmonics, pre Low End Bus . If id want more control id consider a hz-dependent side chain on the bass from the kick, but dont like how that f's with the attack of the bass. Trying to do less processing at all stages......and get there with better balancing ..... So...a tiny bit of  comp on the kick and bass buses (0.5 db slow attack, fast release...usually neutron comp) and only an eq and standard clip on the kick bass bus to only catch random peaks and not jam the final  limiter . i like a littler expansion also , playing around with the pro G expnasion mode is fun",

See, here's my thing with compression: I do like to absolutely smash my bass with compression because I like the sound of a really pinned down bass, and vocals is a given, but other than those two sources, I really don't compress. What I've found is that once I compress one thing,  I find myself going,  \"Oh, this thing needs to be brought up, and then this thing and then this thing...\" and then I end up in a \"loudness war\" with myself. I know tons of people who compress the day lights out of everything, and more power to them. Sometimes I wish I could make it work for me... I also find compression somehow takes away from the impact of things as well, in a way.",

I'm going to add that output attenuator but I'll leave the unit stock. I love the way it sounds! Now I'm curious to hear the ones modded for Electrical Audio though. Did you have the chance to hear them during the St. Vincent recording? Anyway, this is what Greg said about it:\nHello,\n\nYes, my typical modification will change the sound of the preamplifier. The distortion and noise is much lower when the conversion is done. If you are happy with the way yours sounds, you could simply add an output attenuator, like you say. There is a part that is popular in the DIY world for making 1176s.  It is a 3-section 600 ohm \u201cT-pad\u201d potentiometer. You can find it on the Capi website.  \nIf your unit does not currently have a 600 ohm output load resistor, you may want to add a switch to engage the attenuator. Simply having it in the circuit will load the output with 600 ohms. This might lower the headroom and change things a little bit. \n\nGood luck with your project,\n\nGreg Norman",

Now let\u2019s say they exported the song rather quietly to leave headroom for the ME and the whole record needs to be gained up 6db. And let\u2019s say that the song is really dynamic and verse 1 need to be brought up another 6db for consistent level, and then we\u2019re limiting 3db on top of that. We\u2019re now at the point where changes to the signal are at -117, which is getting into the territory of the difference between converters.  \n\nSo if you feel like you can hear the difference between an Apollo and a topping D/A, there will be occasional times where the same would hold true of a 24 bit file where nothing clipped",

Then I add a subtle parallel comp (just as much as it helps) using something more aggressive, the SSL G Bus Comp often works great for that, also like the la2a if a slowerish releases fits into the song.",

These artifacts are unable to be heard unless I have a low pass filter active but I theorize that they, along with the extreme compression subconsciously degrade the listening experience by discretely assaulting your ears to the point of needing to take a break from listening. \n\nMy music can be related sonically to clara la sans \u201canother night\u201d give or take more or less busy. (Keep in mind her stuff is cranked to the point of audible artifacts sitting around -7ish lufs integrated across the chorus).\n\nI arrange the mix well and leave 1db of headroom for summing on individual instruments whilst they are loud enough for my target of -10 LUFi across the chorus, meaning my mix is actually 1db louder than -10 with space to sum on the pre master bus. Leaving headroom means I can introduce less artifacts at the cost of having to squeeze the dynamic range of individual instruments more than otherwise.\n\nMy issue is that If I want to aim for let\u2019s say -8LUFSi across the chorus in a relatively clean way with minimal artifacts, I\u2019m forced to squeeze the mix to -7.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear y\u2019all thoughts on whether or not technically inaudible artifacts/distortion matter and whether or not it\u2019s really worth for me to squeeze my mix 2db more in the name of competitive loudness?\n\nPs.
