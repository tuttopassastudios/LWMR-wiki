    "content": "Ok, so that's a quick summary of the four main types of comp. My suggestion is to pick one model from each category. One and only one. Forget the rest for a while. Start trying it in various places to get a feel for what it does well and how you can use it to shape sounds, to serve the song. The actual plug you choose matters much less than the intrinsic characteristic of the category\n\nLast thought, 99% percent of what I see online in the form or tutorials etc re compression is nonsense, even from some very good friends of mine. Parallel compression for example can be wonderful, but using it as the only workflow on everything for *religious* reasons is just plain silly\n\nTake your time and spend a week with your chosen plug in from each category. Maybe ask here for examples of different styles in real records, Jimmy Pages' acoustic guitars for example. You'll get a sense for it over a little while\n\nOK, QC time over\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n@Slow Hand please feel free to edit this to tighten it up",

I've had great years before, but this one felt like the true intersection of hard work, strategy, and full on luck. \n\nTen years ago I would have looked at this metric and scoffed \u2014 somebody 'phoning it in'... but I really did my best to give everything I had on each and every mix... maybe even to my own detriment. There are dear friends in my circle lapping me (Jon, Lars, etc) with their numbers but still,  this is a big milestone as a mixer. \n\nI\u2019d be remised to not acknowledge the community here and the part it played in having filling the sails with information and inspiration. We all know it can turn for the worst next year, but for now\u2026 it\u2019s good. And you guys and the conversations we had here all had a hand in it.\n\nCheers!",

I don't post every day because I don't always have something to say or to add value, but I do gain a beautiful new perspective on a subject from reading through here at least a few times a week that I wouldn't have had the thought of without this space.\n\nIf you're gonna go after this job for real, you're gonna have the craziest shit thrown at you from clients, collaborators, peers and heroes that you've ever heard. \n\nYour feelings will not be protected when you operate in this industry at a professional level. \n\nSo, learning to take it on the chin and ask \"what is there to learn here?\" in a moment you're challenged is what will make you grow and be resilient. \n\nI just re-printed a stem an hour ago for a background vocal I fucked up \"fixing\" the timing of in the chorus. The client was incredibly direct and insensitive of my feelings about it, and if I hit them back to argue what was \"technically correct\" based on the grid and subdivisions I was looking at, and why I was right, they wouldn't care. They wanted it different, so I saw it through their lens of how they wrote the part and corrected it to deliver for the artist. And you know what? That result was better than my feeling of what was \"technically correct.\" They were right. A beautiful reminder to serve the song rather than to check the box. \n\nThe older I get the more I equally trust my taste and remain open to learning something based on new information. Adopting that mindset will only serve you in the process of experimentation of self and collaboration with others.",

It lets you squeeze so much saturation out of a signal without driving things too hard. \n\nFirst, you drive your signal to the point where the loudest part starts to break up, then you use the de-emphasis to subtract that frequency from the saturation circuit and then you push the gain up even harder until you're on the edge of breakup again. Wash, rinse, repeat. \n\nWhat you end up with is a signal that's evenly saturated across the entire frequency range instead of only having the loudest parts treated, because they're all hitting the saturation at roughly the same level. This thing is amazing. It's the sound that I've been searching for for soooo long.",

It's more that everyone is chopping, clip gaining, and RXing to an evenness that softens and linearizes performances. \n\nThese tools work beautifully when shitty mic technique makes things boomy, or there's a few weird ss's on the pre-hyped TLM mic through the focusrite pre.\n\nBut it sounds like most people who learn the tools are overusing them like crazy. \n\nI'm trying these days to get off the details and try as much macro-mixing as possible.

I did a number on the drums but just couldn't get the low end to sync between the two. I ended up sending the mono bass to two mis-matched outboard compressors. They're totally un-linked and I just matched them by ear and wow... sounds so fucking good. Each one is grabbing and doing it's thing and it's *mostly* adding up to mono but gives real life when things momentarily lean left or right. Reminds me of a drum setup photo today where some of the mics were mis-matched and that's just honest-to-god so OK most of the time.",

This is because  knowing what to ask comes from experience. It is difficult to know what to ask if there are no accumulation of context and situations to consider. It takes frustration and trial/error over situations to know what questions to ask when it comes to mixing. Whatever information or tips are useless without understanding the why. And it may still be useless even if you do understand the why- and that is because \u201cwhy\u201d is the part that matters, not how it\u2019s done or what is done. \u201cWhy\u201d is at the center of all of those things.\n\n2) Be open to the answer B - try to listen and see what B has to offer. Try it out even if you disagree. You can form your opinion once you have done that. But remember, hold a loose grip on opinions- sometimes knowing more or experiencing more things can change your world view and the willingness to shift from that can make or break your growth",

    "content": "@BoozleBAM This is a GREAT question, and having read the whole convo twice I don't think it was really answered. Honestly I probably won't be able to answer it either, but here are some thoughts in no particular order\n\nFirst the usual caveat, I'm not a mixer and I haven't mixed a record in a decade. But I did record and mix for 20 years before that and followed the whole arc from beginner not understanding compression, to pro finding my way and getting to own or use all of the baller dream hardware. All that to say I have a lot of empathy for where you are at with it. These are not definitive statements, just aspects to think about..\n\n1) First something of a hot take that I don't see represented online. IMO compression often makes an individual instrument sound \"worse\". If you play and record something like drums well or acoustic guitar well, a compressed version will often sound *less real* and less vital. So why in the world would we do it???\n\n- The first reason is that we mostly don't care about how individual instruments sound, we care about the whole song. Often a compressed sound will play nicer in an arrangement than something dynamic, real and recorded in a \"documentarian\" way\n\n- The second reason is a trade off that isn't often spoken about. Compressed instruments often translate better into the wild. Take a beautiful, dynamic, real sounding, hifi & documentarian recording of say upright bass, drums and acoustic guitar. Listen in your studio in great monitors and it's a dream. Now go to Target and play it in mono on the overhead speaker on a busy saturday.....it just won't survive ... the song gets lost. Or drive with your window open, or cook dinner with the AC on etc etc.",

    "content": "I am super nerdy / obsessive about single coil hum, here are the tricks I\u2019ve found:\n- all my single coil guitars have been shielded - you should get a pickguard shield and also get the cavities shielded with copper. Puisheen on YouTube (mikes guitar bar) has a great tutorial. This will cost about 10$ per guitar and make a big difference.\n- computer monitors can be a big culprit, especially older Apple Cinema displays. You kinda have to right facing direction with the guitar, usually 90 degrees from the screen. Think of single coils like figure 8 microphones, you want the screen in the null.\n- ground loops can also be a big problem. I had this buzz going on DI guitars and most of my unbalanced synths - turns out one of my midi interfaces was creating a ground loop, you can get a ground lifting usb adapter. In my case I have balanced power at the studio and different phases (not sure if that the correct English term) but basically any USB hub is now on a different circuit then audio stuff and that removed a lot of buzz. On that topic, if you are using pedals make sure you have a good isolated power supply.\n- last but not least: a proper guitar setup will help, if your pickups are too low, the signal to noise ratio will decrease. That being said I think I kinda like my pickup height a little lower than standard but that is just a taste thing.",

The snare is tuned up pretty high but somewhat dead... avoiding the big 150-300hz fundamental that a lot of indie records are chasing these days. It's a very Nigel Godrich-y compression sound which is -- not really the sound of compression on the snare mic, but more on the kit as a whole. You'll notice that the whole kit, cymbals included, is really getting pressed up against whatever compression is happening. And to make that work, the drummer is playing very lightly... even on the heavier chorus sections. I'd probably start with a pair of 1176s or an 1178 strapped across the kit... medium attack and fast release (or heavier handed on a parallel bus) and you'll get that great snap from such a light touch.",

    "content": "Mind if I ramble? I'm working on what is probably the most challenging mix I've done this year. I've been at my first pass for close to 2 weeks, and have probably started it over 4 times. For context, it's a very dense country rock song with like 80-90 tracks, heavy heavy buss processing, many layers hitting exceptional stages of compression and saturation. The most challenging part is that, despite my philosophical differences from the producer's template, the rough mix really works. Anytime I try to strip it back, import my template, do my own thing, make the mix fit into my \"mixing philosophy\", it just falls apart. I've considered stemming it out with Bounce Factory through his template to then put the tracks into my template, but that would be a zero sum game I can already expect to lose. \n\nUltimately I've had to shift my perspective of wondering \"why am I here?\" I'm learning that my role is not to run this song through some proprietary process I take pride in, but to simply just help them reach the finish line by trying to understand and continue within the process they've already deeply baked this song through. I've found that I can apply my perspective while setting my \"process\" aside, and explore what small tweaks or decisions I *can* make that get us the last couple % we might be missing. Any previous approach I've tried I already know would result in a 10+ revision nightmare trying to get back to the original magic of the rough.\n\nAnd on the interpersonal front, I've decided against sharing any of this struggle with the artist. Maybe the mix that gets approved of the 4 that I've done is the one I spent 30 minutes on, but the many hours of me feeling like I'm \"failing\" on the other 3 passes were needed to understand that this track only needed 30 minutes of my time. Excuses don't get us to the finish line. \n\nWhat has been your experience in these situations?",

    "content": "2) The first was a practical reason to compress, the second is more creative. Compression allows us to shape the envelope of sounds, by varying the attack and release and type of compressor we use (we'll come back to that). Why would that be useful? A few examples;\n\n- A fast attack allows us to tame the front of a sound, and set it back in an arrangement. Our ears are naturally drawn to shorter sharper transients, and that can be a lovely thing. But say for example I've got a bright and transient heavy acoustic guitar, it might be distracting me from the vocal and the story of the song, a fast attack and low ratio could allow me to \"set it back\" behind the vocal, without turning it down or darkening it too much\n\n- Another way we can use the envelope shaping is to bring out the body or thump in a sound. Take something like a bright snare crack, a compressor like a DBX160 will grab the front transient and soften it, and then the release curve will give the body and shell of the snare this chunky weight that can be really musical",

Soft has what I understand to be a \"smart\" floating threshold that kind of rides the signal, versus hard is closer to a fixed threshold (and I believe depth then affects the ratio and threshold in it's own way). So, if you were trying to zone in on a frequency that only occasionally rears it's head, hard mode with a lower depth will be generally more accurate and not affect the other parts of the audio nearly as much. I don't like using Soothe on sibilance, but I actually found it quite effective after learning this by setting it to hard mode with a very broad \"sharpness\".",

It\u2019s why the saying \u201cthe muse finds you working\u201d is a thing. \n\nSo what I found when choosing to write despite not being inspired, was that that\u2019s the only time I could work on the *craft*. Inspiration is a slave driver. \n\nThis held true over into the recording world for me as well. When I was trying to capture something in my head I was a slave to it, but when I\u2019m trying to capture something in someone else\u2019s head, I\u2019m merely curious and experimental. And *that\u2019s* when I learned the craft. Mixing, recording, producing, etc. \n\nThe TL;DR of it all is I think being a service oriented technician is a major part of growing into your artistry.

I was treated to a bit of a real life MWTM with Chris Coady last night (super kind guy) and he was showing me this plugin to mix a big pop vocal sound. He duplicated the lead vocal twice to have three tracks and had this plugin as the first insert on each track, split into three bands for each channel, low vocal, mid vocal, high end vocal. The plugin auto syncs the band settings in all instances whenever you adjust a band. He was saying Serban uses this plugin and does that exact thing on some songs. After treating each track with some eq/comp/saturation the vocal sounded really big but balanced. And it\u2019s like $60 so I think I\u2019m going to have to grab it. Probably could do this with other plugins but I appreciated the auto-syncing function and also didn\u2019t notice any weird phase issues which you could maybe run into trying to create the bands by hand?",

My rule of thumb is lower voicing tend to occupy center-mid, and the higher voicings out wide to create a wider spread. Like if I was making a Queen record, I'd probably stick to your approach because the arrangement would be airtight -- and LCR would work great. But if I was fucking with some indie pop producer that has a boner for a million tracks in his session, then it's warfare and I'm just trying to place things where they work.",

Make quick moves and jump to something else, if the kick is too\u2026.. it will remind you everytime you listen. Try  to step back and listen to your mixes like a ME. Is there too much or not enough of a certain frequency range?  Then dive back into the micro move adjust and move on. This helps  you stay in the flow and to not get lost  in the weeds.  In my experience the music tells you most of what you need to know. Tempo has a huge effect on how the low end can work. Density often determines how midrange and upper mid/ high freq should work.  The elements in the mix should be serving particular roles and that informs where things should sit and ultimately equal how it makes you feel. I don\u2019t think very much when I mix but I react to what\u2019s in front of me . \nThe more you do this the more this will lock in. Another thing that comes to mind, is sometimes if I\u2019m feeling like something isn\u2019t right I\u2019ll do a save as or In your example I\u2019ll mute the kick and duplicate it and start from scratch and see if I can beat it.

I've always strayed away from it in lieu of keeping things fluid for easy recalls. However, since I've been doing 100% of my mixing in this studio and this gear probably isn't goin anywhere, I've been more comfortable leaning on a hardware chain with (what I think are) great results. \n\nFirst, I'm going into an old UTA Unfairchild. This was the first model that came out with the 6BC8 tubes instead of the current 6386 tubes. I always preferred the older model and was lucky to snatch one when Barefoot kicked the bucket. I'm not actually doing any compression, I've just got gain at unity and signal passing through. The second stage is a pair of UTA MPEQ-1's. I *thought* that I was doing a high shelf boost starting at 8.3k going into a LPF @ 22k. \n\nI've really, really been enjoying the sound of this. I notice a little midrange clarity from the unfairchild and I find the additive high end on the buss is much more musical than boosting individual elements.",

He uses peak limiters and clippers everywhere, so nothing has a chance of peaking out from where he placed it. That\u2019s in effect trimming all the Attack of an instrument but not really messing with the decay sustain or release because with a peak limiter it\u2019s acting so fast that you can use it to manipulate a sound without it drastically changing the other aspects of it ADSR in synth world works the same in all audio. A clipper does the manipulation for \u201csaturation\u201d to get the desired grit that we might have gotten in yesteryear from things like tubes tape and transformers.\n\nI think that it\u2019s likely a smart fast and easy way to get a result like JC is looking for where it\u2019s loud and sounds open still. Because you can\u2019t really hear the peak limiting like you can hear a compressor doing 4:1 compression. Also know JC has a 1k \u201chandicap\u201d as he calls it on his mix bus, pulling out a few db and he is using the spectral shaper from 1-6k to tame harshness on the mix bus. (Don\u2019t do this just because he does) These are things he\u2019s added because it helps him get to his desired result faster, and when you mix one or two songs a day everyday for years you\u2019re going to develop \u201ctricks\u201d or \u201chandicaps\u201d or whatever you want to call them to help you get to your desired result.\n\nLearn everything you can about mixing if that\u2019s what you want to do, and use only the things you try that YOU like, not because someone else makes work you like, your mileage may vary",

    "content": "this is answer might not be the most exciting.\n\nActual Separation does not come from EQ, Compression and Saturation. These are just tool to help manipulate a sound into how you want it to sound. \n\nSeparation comes from Arrangement. If you have a Piano and a Guitar playing full chords in the same octave, you'll never get good sounding separation, no matter how much you try and manipulate the sound.\nSounds are made from a fundamental and certain overtones/harmonics. If they overlap, then they overlap, even if you add a random eq boost on each sound some Freqs apart, because someone on youtube did that. (not that you can't do it, and it wont work)\nBut Instead of removing good sounding parts of a sound forcing them to fit together(whatever that even means at this point), arrange the parts so they naturally fit together with separation. This way you'll be able to act more, creatively and instinctively on how you want the sounds to sound while mixing, instead of fitting a triangle into a circle. As the good old saying says, it starts at the source, for the best results. \n\nFx, in a typical jazz band, often a Bass will play roots on 1 & 3,  a piano will of then play the root and 5th an octave above that, and a guitar could play the 3rd and 7th, and together all the instruments make big full chords while also having their own space. this way there is now plenty of room for a singer or a Sax player to do its thing and not worry to much about cutting through a dense mix.",

He explained that he was playing totally to the OH mics and the kick was not the point but was only a supporting role (like a jazz performance ) . He jokingly told me off that it \u201cwasn\u2019t fucking hip hop \u201c, \u201cwith a kick and snare and some shit sprinkled on top \u201c. We were both in stitches (laughing ) at this point .

Everything came from Ryan very well cooked with his analog futzery and UAD stuff, so lots of coralling with EQ on my end... not much added compression. Looks like the guitar solo went through my old Federal 864 compressor -- which is wild, that thing works on something every 6 months maybe. Some drums went through my old SansAmp pedal. Lots of the guitars got squeezed with my Scully 280s. The whole album has the vocals going through my BG2 -- although this one has some snippets that were ITB... Ryan was constantly tweaking the production throughout the mix process, hence the many versions. A fun collaborative process with a record I still get excited to listen to.",

    "content": "So for this song I was hired to produce and mix it. I got the stems from the demo and did the production in ableton. Then vocals were recut in London and I was sent a Pro Tools session. I always cut and edit in Pro Tools, so I used this session to comp and arrange the new vocals, but then I wanted to just bring it back into ableton and blend with the existing production. So I bounced the vocal from Pro Tools dry  (no verb or delay) but with tuning and some compression and EQ. Then I used some of the demo vocal and some of the new vocal in the final mix.\n\nI'm pretty comfortable committing eq and compression on my vocals (the confidence of years of doing this... ps you should do it more, it's good for the workflow). But if I needed to go back for some reason I could go back to the Pro Tools session. I think I did go back once to remove tuning on an ad lib that was part singing, part talking. \n\nI'm getting much more comfortable mixing in ableton. The only thing that really sucks about it is that the sessions do tend to slow down when there's TONS of vocals with autotune inserts (the equivalent number of tracks and autotune instances in pro tools does not tax Pro Tools nearly in the same way). So thus far the only way that ableton really works for me to both produce and mix in is if I don't have raw vocals in there. Hence, bouncing from pro tools works best anyway.",

Sometimes the mountain analogy doesn\u2019t quite click with me because I feel it infers challenge, met with triumph. \n\nBut I never feel like I\u2019ve triumphed!

And even if they were, nobody is marking this stuff empirically out of ten (hear me out @BatMeckley \ud83d\udc40).\n\nI produced + mixed a single early on in my bedroom (Rokit 5s, baby!) that attained certain undeniable metrics of success, but listening back, it\u2019s so clear that it did so *in spite* of my (in)competence as a mixer. It still *feels* great, but sonically it\u2019s all over the shop. I\u2019ve since wandered the great valley of intuition-knowledge-intuition, and the only really crucial thing I\u2019ve picked up is that if it *feels* great, the rest is largely (obvs take that lightly) inconsequential. I know this is not a novel thought, especially recently here. But anyway\u2026\n\nAnother reason for my certainty about this is that there are so many records I listened to in my teens (pre any recording/mixing/critical listening experience etc) that *felt* amazing and blew my mind then, and still do now - even though now I can step back and hear the abrasive guitars, out of tune everything, etc etc.\n\nAll this to say that the reason I don\u2019t ever feel like I\u2019ve triumphed / bested a climb is that in 1/2/5 years from now, I\u2019m going to listen back on my work from today and cringe at the over brightness, the congestion, the brickwall filter ringing at 732Hz \ud83d\udc40, the mixbus compression folding too hard on that downbeat\u2026",

I found out the hard way that I tended to fiddle with things unnecessarily and records ended up sounding tweaked and weird. I developed a couple of techniques to avoid this, to keep me from messing with things while still paying attention enough to catch problems. For a long time I would read, but it had to be really dry un-interesting stuff. The magazine the Economist was perfect, as were things like technical manuals and parts catalogs. I had a stack of them by the console. It can\u2019t be anything interesting or with a story line like fiction because then you can get engrossed and stop paying attention to the session. It has to be really dull, basically so you are looking for an excuse to put it down and do something else. This has proven to be a really good threshold, so that if anything sounds weird or someone says something you immediately give it your full attention and your concentration hasn\u2019t been ruined by staring at the speakers and straining all day.\n\nLately I play Scrabble, and it serves the same purpose_",

Certain meters move faster than others, not all 10ms attack times will actually attack the same, certain GUIs that imply some sort of analog modeling may not actually do so, etc. Just listen and trust your ears.\n\n2. If you can't hear certain aspects right away, that's fine too. You can't force it, don't rush it. Still just listen and trust your ears.\n\n3.

The really magical part of what they're doing is knowing, for themselves and Billie/Finneas, what was the right stuff to add/take away. The NOT magical part was how they did it- just instantiating two different LA-2A's and flipping between them and saying \"yeah i like that\". I do that shit every day, but do I always make the right string of choices one after the other throughout the mix? Probably not.

Song I was on the other day had horns, vocal, and occasionally gtr were leading and everything else was just supporting (either octaves of the same part, rhythmically the same, or pads on keys). So I got those 3 rocking together without worrying about every track, it was easy to identify the kind of space I needed. I wanted it in the same room as the brass, but really forward on the stage. If I\u2019d had the pads up while trying to do this I was always either too wet or too dry and couldn\u2019t find the happy place. The tl;dr is, if you\u2019re struggling to find a satisfying construction of ideas, you may be trying to treat leading and supporting parts as equally important, and you\u2019re challenging your ear to grab what\u2019s really important at that moment. \n\nAlso in Brauer\u2019s template there are a folder of verbs that everything in the session shares including vocals. So you get a sense of cohesion from that, and the vocals have their own folder of delays that are unique to them. That helps create separation.",

I usually just put a time delay on it before reverb if I want musically timed reverb, but I personally tend not to go towards that direction very often. I\u2019m also a big throws person so mostly my main reverb that are sent to aux tracks have medium to longer predelay and throws would have shorter predelay. Sometimes it\u2019s the other way around too. I also like to make decisions based on how long I want the vocals to be closeup for before I hear the reverb kick in. Or I also print reverb sometimes and nudge it around in different parts and play with fades if I wanna get really sculpt-y with it. I do this with reverb throws (dups clips to audio tracks rather than sends) more often than send verbs.",

I guess what I meant to say is that through the dozens of interviews with Jon and Matt, it's clear that he's averse to using compressors and tends to use saturators more to do the job. While I fuckin' LOVE me some saturators, I honestly don't see the two as interchangeable... they're just two very different tools. One is leveling volume and the other is distorting a waveform to generate harmonics. I think saturators are a great next level tool for people who have wrapped their brains around compression.... but you really need some form of compression on an un-treated vocal. I feel in contemporary music, people are leaning too much on high-end saturation to get things to sound exciting and hyped. If I'm ever using saturators to distort things (which is often), I'm always trying to find some sort of un-distorted high end source to help the ears cling to clarity in the mix. Sometimes, things will distort in a way that will add this clarity -- or even manufacture it. But most of these multi-band saturators are just adding a layer of fuzz to the entire midrange up and the whole mix just ends up sounding hazy. IMO, a great example of modern hip-hop mixing is Mac Miller's Circles. The high end on that record sounds just as exciting as anything else, but it doesn't sound like everything got ran through a buzz saw (shoutout Greg Koller/Jon Brion). Just my 0.02.",

When you learn to do it and to hear it, you learn why it's so important (pulling low end plosives out of a vocal so it doesn't pin the compressor, for example).

As the release lets go and brings up the room gain you get this urgent and explosive energy. When the room is good, and the compression timing is set right it can really make things sound bigger than real life. Remember we're trying to tell a story here, we can't jam the *actual* real power and size of stadium rock drums into that mono speaker at Target but listen to Paradise City and it tells the story pretty well ... our brain does an amazing job of filling in the rest\n\n- The last example is using something like a good tube compressor on vocals. With a nice soft knee and lots of gain reduction we get bring up a bunch of low level and emotional detail, breathy whispery stuff at the end of lines etc that can really help a lyric connect. Often with something like a good tube compressor we get a healthy amount of harmonic distortion too along for the ride which adds weight to the vocal and draws the listeners attention",

Wanting this to be a hybrid of the two sounds, not a live show and not a spotify release but somewhere in the middle, so I premixed the snare/kick/tom samples and triggered them in. My favorite element for this is that I can work with the overheads in addition to the close mics and sculpt those to fit each drum. For example, the toms I'm blasting the overhead with tape saturation that is giving them a nice airy attack. then when I trigger them in, I'm essentially getting that tone from the overheads without applying that processing to the entire overhead mix (which has loads of cymbals). If most of my snare tone was coming from just close mics, I wouldn't care as much about triggering it would just be more for a consistent sound. but since I can sculpt the overheads so distinctly for each drum, it's making a much bigger impact on the mix to use these samples. additionally, i'm triggering in the kick and snare from the original track, which are kind of pop/electronic sounding, and just blending them in enough to get the attitude of the studio version.\"*",

The amount of times I\u2019ve worked with an artist and (it\u2019s usually in logic in these scenarios) they say let\u2019s turn that word up and they clip gain it up 3db and it doesn\u2019t get louder but the compression and tone change.

Looking back on mixes I\u2019ve done, there were mixes that effortlessly turned up without being squashed and still felt good and there were mixes that I couldn\u2019t get loud whatsoever. Being able to get balance and competing things out of the way and placing density in the right place is something I\u2019m working on my mixes these days. Low pass filtering surprisingly has been helping a lot. The resonant peak can give presence in intended areas while the filtering also creates room for bright elements to shine.",

I mix banjo a lot (country music,) and I\u2019ve got a couple thoughts that might be helpful if you\u2019re not already finished. \n1) choose the top carefully. Where the \u201cbrightness\u201d of the track is changes so much of how it\u2019s perceived in the track. Chances are the top end is actually much lower than you\u2019d expect. \n2) try compressing the shit out of it. Squash it allll to hell, kill the dynamics, RUIN the performance. There\u2019s a good chance if it\u2019s performed well it\u2019ll turn into a punchy percussive element that adds size and excitement. \n3) make sure it\u2019s balanced with another instrument on the other side of the the stereo field. If you don\u2019t have one that\u2019s playing something similar or has a similar top end, give it the old mono-verb/delay and see if that helps balance and keep it from being too distracting.\nHope that helps!",

Saturation is a great way of doing this without making things pokey... but might be good to audition with an EQ first to see what zones you should focus in on.

Not to be a purist at all but try and figure out what it is that it\u2019s actually doing and how you can achieve something similar at the source.

Wildest Pro-Q curves you ever seen, split across a bunch of tracks with different EQ and compressors for each word in some cases. I was pretty happy with the results in the end though, pretty imperceptible after everything went through the vocal mix chain.Took ages but it was a good ear training lesson. \n\n@jantrit \u2018s recipe above is a good methodology\n\n*Went back and dug it out, it was second verse of this track - 1:58 \"a lot to learn, a lot to earn\" was recorded on iPhone https://open.spotify.com/track/2yhKDrTVMCLBWYd0aIfOfy?si=1a2914797e6843d8\n\nIt's got a low double and the FX are such a part of the character; it's a context that allows this tomfoolery.\n\n\nIncidentally, just remembering some other stuff around that record. It was produced by Philippe Zdar (that particular edit was made less than two weeks before his tragic death), and I remember the stems coming in with all of their character baked in. Wouldn't say it's the band's best album, but some of the parts were awesome.\n\nA bass guitar came in with the hihat baked in to it, so I dutifully went back on emails asking for them separated, but that was how he'd printed it - they were sharing some piece of gear, and for whatever reason that's how they had to go down. Mark Ralph was mixing it, and at the time I might've had a bit of a \"huh, Zdar's supposed to be a professional, why is the hi hat on the bass channel\" sort of bullshit attitude, but that particular instance cleared that right out. Mark's response to anything like that was always pure acceptance and understanding that people work how they work and it's his job to do what he can with whatever he receives.",

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

I find that this is a side effect of everyone having the ability to be able to record from their home or wherever. It\u2019s becoming more rare to have a record made with the traditional producer/engineer team working on a record From beginning to end. It\u2019s more common a band will come in and track basics take it home for a few weeks try a bunch stuff out in their untreated room where they really can\u2019t tell if they are adding something to the arrangement that\u2019s muddying up a the song or if it  needs a different mic, positioning or eq ect. Or if in fact  it\u2019s an orchestration issue.  Regardless they add it and send it to a mixer and say it sounds shitty because it hasn\u2019t been mixed yet.  This is where I disagree with the whole \u201cthey\u2019ve been living with it for however long so just make everything better than what they had\u201d. Serban says somewhere down the line decisions haven\u2019t been made. So even though I might get push back I\u2019m going to try to do whatever  it is I think will make the mix better even if it\u2019s crossing over into  the role of production. I can always give them back what they had but often the mix needs some things muted and calls for some big moves when the scenario above happens.

So dynamics and sonic interest are your friend. If you can find ways to create contrast and change over 30 second intervals that will go a long way towards engaging the listener. Then again, let's assume that the artist knows what they're doing and has it the way that they want.\n\nIf possible, I think it would be fun to invite them in to the mix session and collaborate on the mix with them sitting next to you.

I've been having pretty smooth results since 2020 like this:\n\n\n- Get clients on headphones (unfortunately a necessity for feedback/delay reasons, but I'm finding a lot of times that's how they listen to most music anyway, so they're very familiar with their headphones of choice). \n\n- Have them open your Audiomovers link.\n\n - Start a Facetime/Zoom call on your phone with whoever needs to be there. Mute your own Facetime mic on your phone, but clients leave theirs open. They'll hear your chat via the talkback mic you've set up in Tools.\n\n - Use talkback mic routing as pictured. If you're a Pro Tools nerd, you can probably work out what's going on by following the routing and sidechain assignments in the screenshot, but:\n\n\nI print mixes and the limited ref (usually just tickling Pro-L 2) at the same time, so I make a Pre-Fade send to the Audiomovers bus from my Mix Print channel. This is also where the limiter lives, so their Audiomovers feed goes out at a healthy level.\n\nMy talkback channel (usually a 57) has a ducking compressor on it, sidechained from the Listen Print send and set to stun. This means my TB mic gets (more or less) muted during playback, so I can work on speakers while I make their tweaks. Muteomatic is still in my template, but I think I opted for the sidechained compressor because delay tails etc were getting double piped down to clients through my mic the moment playback stopped, whereas the compressor has adjustable release so it can come back up more or less as the tails die.\n\nIf any of that doesn't make sense, just lemme know and I can amend this post.",

I stick it out for around 10 minutes, and when I go back I'm almost always hearing things the way I should be.\n\nAnd if I've the time, for an extra boost of awareness, when I come back from my shower I spend about 10-20 minutes just listening to music of a similar genre to what I'm working on, without changing the volume level between songs or when I go back to my DAW. When I stick to this routine I usually do my best work.\n\nI've also *really* fucked up some mixes due to attempting to get them done when I ain't hearing things right.

Starting with the biggest section of the song helps as well. I can then automate the other sections up or down *including the master fader feeding the 2bus*  As far as clipping/limiting on sources/busses I find it good to shape the sounds how I want (more heavy lifting) then the busses/2bus end up just glueing it together with a lighter touch.

I would suggest having the dynamics tamed to your liking before boosting low end in a vocal because it can easily get out of hand\n\nYou could try duplicating the take, use RX de-reverb or whatever you can to remove as much ambience as possible, compress it heavily and blend it in. Obviously compression will bring out ambience so as to not let that become an issue try removing it beforehand. \n\nAVOX duo is a neat trick I use sometimes to help give a vocal some dimension.

Then i will mess w the EQ settings of the delay signal to give it the right freq content. I personally only use the ping pong and stereo modes (never really use the M/S). \n\nThen in the third tab i set up the ducking  and mess with the threshold and release settings to duck out of the way of the lead. I love the sound of the echo swelling up after the phrase is done so i'll usually start at -15 for theshold and ~100ms for release and experiment from there. that third tab also has noise, gate, and a wobble option to add some more character. Then just like the diffusion setting in valhalladelay - you can use the reverb and decay settings to add verb to the delay signal pre/on feedback/post in the chain to give it more softness/space. \n\nBut the killer feature is then you can modulate these settings in the 2nd tab... then i add a little percentage change to one side of the ping pong delay ~1.3% so it's not completely locked in and just adjust settings from there. on the first page, you can also drive the input super hard to get a distorted sound and bring down the output level (like a preamp). It's super versatile and you can get big swelling verb echoes or overdrive space echo type sounds.",

    "content": "This is also the biggest reason that analog synths have so much more solid of a lowend than any digital synth. It\u2019s not the saturation giving you that solidity. It\u2019s that hardware LPFs don\u2019t have anywhere near the same amount of cascading delay differential. I.e. a software bass synth by default has a slight reverb that is phase canceling itself wellllllll into the passband (like all the way down iirc) just by the nature of it having a digital LPF bottlenecked at 44.1, where a moog filter has very little of that going on because the sample rate of the real world is infinite, or the speed of light, depending on how you look at it.",

The warmth slider that makes a sound feel warmer or cooler is super fun to me. It's not transparent, but the limiting is gentler, so I like it guiding a sound into its place. Its goal is to make the overall artifacts of limiting more pleasing\n2) I find it faster, more versatile, and better for limiting than a Vari-Mu emulation. Not to mention the UI is way more helpful than what I'm used to with a plugin looking to remind us of a Fairchild or similar\n3) Yes, it just doesn't brickwall, and it has a vibe\n4) You don't Need Tupe if you have a saturator you already like, but I adore it. I was skeptical at first, but I demoed it on drums, and it changed my life. Always on drums and bass guitar for me. Again, Goodhertz's UI makes it more versatile than any other Tube and/or Tape emulator I've seen. It has a million options to tailor the saturation. The Opto Compressor and simple EQ are fast and versatile. It sounds good",

People are referencing vocals that feel like this.

Beyond that my main thought is that I don\u2019t want to hear the microphone. ie. mechanical sounding capsule buzz is something I tend to attenuate. \n\nAll of this happens without me being able to hear the instrumental context (though I wish I could. RX integration into a daw context would be a game changer for me). \n\nRuairi will rebalance the harmonics in a vowel, and while I also do that some in a vocal prep context, it\u2019s harder because the undulation of resonances in a full musical context sometimes feels exciting while in solo it sounds off-putting. Ruairi gets to have the whole song in his RX window where I\u2019m often only hearing the vocal, so I have to be a little more careful to imagine context and hedge my bets Hippocratic oath style, lest it looses some life.",

And I think part of the reason it works for him is that he's probably right, obviously he's at a level where the productions are professional, and again obviously his mixes bump hard.\n\nBut I also think there are situations out in the world where sounds are 100% finished and those moves would be a step back. And obviously many situations where sounds are nowhere near 90% finished and need a heavier lift from the mixer. So if your producer clients are at a different place, then you'll need to be at a correspondingly different place to still add up to 100%.\n\nHe\u2019s of course smart enough and skilled enough to perceive what\u2019s what.",

I have a few thoughts:\n\nI am skeptical of the sense of security that comes from what you call the 'overly busy' feeling. If 'constantly busy with work' = safe, then the moment work dries up you're under threat. That's a tough way to be and can undermine well-being in the long run.\n\nThe sense of security I derived from 'feeling busy' in the past was largely financial based. New projects meant a longer runway of cash-flow. I think we all have our own threshold with the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that stems from financial instability. Looming financial ruin can be motivating. Personally it makes me motivated and dumber. Past motivated dumb me hasn't always made good decisions for future me.\n\nHowever one such decision that turned out to be good was starting about 7 years ago when my client work would slow I started making instrumental music and releasing it under anonymous artist projects. Client work would eventually come in then slow again and I'd make more inst music. Fast forward to now and it pays for all of my living expenses, I can invest more in my studio and the projects I truly care about. The downside is that time spent holing up alone making music is time that otherwise could have been spent building relationships and connecting with other people / artists / writers / producers. Oftentimes we are just a conversation away from the next great project.",

You can get a lot of cool subtle movement. That can fill in the audio spectrum nicely. As example above could use subtle movement to fill out a pad. Or there are more adventurous circular 3D panning options that I find work well top end arps or vox chops. It was an idea born out of how people use 1/8 ping pong delays to fill out behind Bass guitar. Basically a different way to have the audio swim around subtly behind the main source. Try it.

I have noticed that many of my favorite mixes are, in fact, IMPERFECT! There are things I notice about them all the time that I, myself, as a preeminent mixer to be, would change: SOmetimes they're too compressed, sometimes they're a little harsh, sometimes I can't really hear the snare, sometimes the snare sounds like a tyco toy... I just found it interesting that all these mixes that I've idoloized and resonated with for so long had things that, to me, were glaringly imperfect... Back to my 3-day old wine. Thanks, guys!",

    "content": "@diamndsdancin \n\nThis is good advice. Early on I spent a lot of time using exclusively plugins that modelled \"magic\" analog pieces. These plugins were supposed to add \"vibe\" and \"mojo\" and \"that sound.\" \n\nSome of these plugins are indeed great, but the hyperbole use to describe them distracted me from learning about compression as a tool to solve a problem. These standard controls, like attack/release times, are the key to making the tool effective. \n\nOnce you understand the mechanical stuff a bit, the esoteric \"vibe machine\" plugins become even more fun. Like, you're telling me your new favorite compressor looks like a soviet radio and only has one knob labelled \"BLAST?\" Well now your trained ear can hear that the BLAST knob shortens the attack time as you turn it and that's why it pulverizes the leading edge of your sounds. You knew you liked the sound of it before, and that gut feeling is valuable, but now you know you can use this fictional soviet radio compressor plugin anytime you identify a problem that can solved by fast attack compression. Brain meet gut.\n\nYou also know that if you're in a situation without your new favorite fictional soviet radio compressor plugin, you can likely achieve similar results using a different compressor.

    "content": "I think that might be a limiting factor on top of the artists' abilities (Pop Smoke already sounded dope before his setup got professional https://youtu.be/317TP4JOSSE). I've recorded not-so-great rappers through nice chains and mixing wasn't the answer to save a (lacking) source. It never gave you *that* feeling. But even if you are recording great rappers cheaper mics tend to lack body and rarely have \"boostable\" or pleasant top end as you said. So it's a bit complicated before you even get to \"mixing\". Felt that was important to mention so you're not too hard on yourself.\n\nBut assuming that the limiting factor really is just mixing there's a bunch of options. First things first: is your monitoring and listening environment decent? Or are you on headphones? This could make placing vocals even harder for you. \n\nThen do you have a process that starts with vocal cleanup to get rid of or reduce unappealing harshness or performance issues? Despite being simple, people tend to skip basic tools like clip-gain to even out a performance. This should usually also give you some leeway for strategic boosts. Maybe instead of EQ look at harmonics. Fresh Air by Slate is free. Gem Dopamine is nice. Spectre is great. All of these should give you that \"sizzle\" you might be missing.\n\nThen to get the presence and even out the performance you could try some parallel compression with something like an 1176. Also, try out Multiband Compression with the Mcdsp 404 or C6 or whatever you have to control the performance throughout the song once you've got a vocal sound you like.\n\nI also find mixing the 808 & drums together with the vocal the most useful when it comes to gain staging and getting the song to feel right.\n\nObviously, there's more that could be said but I find processes more helpful than tools. It's art at the end of the day. Attached what Serban's assistant sees as their/his \"mixing process\". Mix more and experiment with what you have. Get feedback from the artists.",

Another thing I'd try if you have it is soothe2 if you can get it to mostly work on that resonance without killing the tone (even maybe these both in combination) and then finally I'd try something like Saturn or Kclip in multiband and try and use a combination of dynamics and saturation within that band to tame it further.  If it's really bad maybe a combination of those 3, or just automating an EQ but that sounds grueling and time consuming if it's throughout the entire performance.  Maybe Surfer EQ could also accomplish this but I don't have that plug.  I also think there's a Surfer EQ type function in Nectar or Neutron?  Somebody that knows Izotope's stuff better than me can probably chime in.\n\nMy 2 cents and probably there are some better solutions out there but this is where I'd start personally!",

This allows the limiter to examine the incoming audio in advance and predict the amount of gain reduction needed to meet the requested output level.

They're aiming for the same target (emulate an analog 1176), but they were both built by different teams, and thus there will be variations that keep them from nulling, even if they're designed to do the same thing.\n\nThat said, I don't hear any appreciable difference between the two OTTs. For me it comes down to the Xfer Records plugin having  a more intuitive set of controls, so it's got my vote. \ud83d\ude42",

So I\u2019ll saturate high end on vocals or bass to get more openness without harsh high end boosts, I\u2019ll use the same sort of settings on close mics on acoustic drums to get more attack and punch. \n\nThis is an Oversimplification but Nothing is bad in excess if it sounds good.

I love the way MAAT Santa Cruz does this ever so smoothly. \n2. I compress the bass with a compressor sidechained to a LPF(!), to get some low end body which is usually severely lacking. The LPF is set between 1000-2000 hz, attack 0-8 ms and release 200-400 ms depending on the tempo of the song/bass part. Reducing 3-5 dB on peaks. This gets me really far.\n3. If the bass is a shortscale, I\u2019ll use Goodhertz Tiltshift to move the low mids from around 200 hz to around 100 hz, out of the way of the guitars. \n4. Then I put an amp emulation on the channel. Whichever one floats your boat. Plugin Alliance B15, Guitar Rig, TSE BOD, whatever. I\u2019ll be boosting low end and cutting high end here, or before with a separate instance of Tiltshift. \n5. If I want the bass to sound \u201erock\u201c and cut, I send it to a parallel distortion, which can be anything. I like TSE BOD, which is another sansamp copy which  has a lot of sub. My trick here is to add a clipper before the sansamp to really get extra gnarl. Logic\u2018s stock Bitcrusher works great, but I\u2019m sure anything works.",

I think with sustain, there\u2019s a lot of nuance in how you want the sustain to sit- performance is a huge part of this. Sometimes there\u2019s too much bright stuff and it doesn\u2019t allow the sustain to be audible, if you can tell something\u2019s down there but you can\u2019t really feel it or hear it that might be the issue.

Usually on loop edges, so you can deal with them and make a new loop (you might have to copy-paste a kick transient or guitar attack from elsewhere).\n\nVast majority of cases are mouth noises, often on in-breaths or ends of words (but everywhere in between too - squelchy mouth closes and opens, all sorts really).\n\nTotally depends on the singer. Some are fiends for it, some less so. Especially if they need a drink - a sip of water can save work down the line.\n\nThey\u2019ll usually be more apparent in quieter phrases, closer to the mic etc. where the \u201csignal to noise\u201d (ie vocal to clicks) ratio is lower.\n\nI work largely in pop, so layers of compression and generally a brighter vocal balance exaggerate them, plus the lead vocal tends to be forward in mixes, in arrangements that lend themselves to vocal clarity in the upper mids and above.",

Mute everything.\n2. Pull up kick in and out (+ sub or whatever they've recorded). Play with balance and phase of kick out until it feels good (good is context dependent - sometimes that's deep/subby/slow, sometimes that's punchy/percussive etc).\n4. Bring up overheads along with kick mics. Flip overhead phase and play with balance til it sounds cool, or punchy, or whatever you're after. Sometimes there's a very obvious right or wrong answer, but often just figure out whatever works for the drum groove + arrangement + song. Where the bass sits can often help tell you what config will work best.\n5. Solo snare mics, get them in phase with each other (just listen together and flip usually snare bottom until the blend sounds cool to you - often I'm looking for whichever configuration has more \"thud\", but that's context dependent). \n6.Unsolo and check snares against kicks and overheads. If you need to flip the snares, flip both top and bottom (or whatever combo) together so their relative phase remains intact. \n6. Add in rooms, again flipping and balancing til shit feels cool. Do same for crush mics, any other flavour stuff.\n\nToms are usually my last concern. Unless the groove is tom heavy, they might do only 2 or 3 hits across the whole song, so as Ryan said - hand gate those fuckers and deal with them once the general sound is dialled in.",

Super handy for lots of functions - either very precise and malleable gate open and close on the audible drums themselves, but also for instrument sidechains, maybe Pro-MB ext input on a bass track, a sine generator under the kick / noise generator on snare, the Slate Trigger feeds etc. \n\nHaving the gate triggers as audio allows you to slide them a couple samples back and forth as needed for groove or faux lookahead. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s easier ways to do things (it\u2019s a somewhat old school technique), but making them is one of my prep steps and they do get used in every session.",

Even with \u201cinclude return and master effects\u201d checked in the export settings in Live, your tracks won\u2019t 1:1 with dynamics processing or non linear processing (saturation) without using external side-chain routing.\n\nI\u2019d have a discussion with your mixer about if they\u2019d like you to remove your mix bus or if they\u2019d like it baked into each track/stem you are printing.  If it\u2019s the latter, you can create sidechain source tracks to feed plugins that allow for an external sidechain input to keep it closer to 1:1 (still likely not fully accurate with the nonlinearities in some analog modeled plugins).\n\nThis is a pretty tough thing to type out but if we can find a few minutes today where our time overlaps I\u2019m down to hop on a VC and show my workaround for this situation in Ableton.",

We\u2019re still on this learning journey so happy for any pushback or insight\n\nFor the most part, our group felt the tradeoffs of very subtle multiband often outweigh the benefits, since just putting those crossovers in the signal makes a bigger difference than, say, a dB of control.\n\nWe felt more liberal use of multiband can add an aggression and excitement that is very familiar and unique, and prefer treating it as a sweetener or energizer over the whole mix more than trying to control problem areas that could be addressed on tracks.\n\nIn the signal chain, its position can drastically effect how other tools behave. Up front, it can help a bus compressor or saturation device behave more predictably, but may mush things too much. Near the end, it allows those devices to play a more colorful role but may cause weird behavior when using fast, \u201ctransparent\u201d limiters afterward. I like it first right now, most of our group like it near the end.\n\nThe hallmark signs of overuse for us were mixes that sound overly strident or when a vocal becomes inconsistent tonally from section to section as density changes.\n\nTools-wise, the group unanimously preferred minimum phase tools over linear phase or dynamic phase. OTT is a starting point, ear training to recognize that color. Once you hear it at 15-20%, you won\u2019t be able to unhear it on many pop records. After ingraining that color, ML4000 and C4 both have their own flavors that can do a thing while offering tweakability when needed.",

    "content": "So, I\u2019m a long-time follower of this thread, but have been to scared to post any questions as I\u2019m afraid to look like a total dumb ass\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a singer/songwriter/guitarist who has been teaching myself how to record/mix over the past few years. I don\u2019t totally suck, but I have a long way to go.\n\nI\u2019m working on a mix for a client\u2014yes that\u2019s new for me\u2014and I want to kill myself \ud83d\ude42\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a big, dumb rock song (I.e. Foo Fighters), and I can\u2019t for the life of me reign in the drums\u2014in other words, there\u2019s freaking cymbal bleed in EVERY mic. So, I have this situation where I tame the shitty cymbals\u2014then get something that sounds like kick and snare samples playing along to a vacuum cleaner. Mostly because I\u2019ve put every stinking plug-in like Soothe, multi-band compression and dynamic EQ on the overheads and rooms. Yeah! My cymbals don\u2019t poke your ears out\u2014but, they also sound like a Rumba.\n\nAnd gating did not work as the drummer is hitting his shitty cymbals on every freaking beat! I ended up sampling a god forgive\u2014clean snare hit and using that as a sample. It\u2019s okay, but without being able to raise the level of the rooms and overheads, I\u2019m kind of fucked.\n\nI found myself referencing this Joel Hamilton production/mix of a Highly Suspect song as it\u2019s kind of similar to what I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s on Puremix. He\u2019s pretty amazing. And while the music isn\u2019t my thing\u2014it sounds awesome. His mix sounds big and organic\u2014while mine sounds like an electric ham sandwich.\n\nWithout hearing the song, I don\u2019t know how much advice I can expect. I just mostly want to vent\u2026\n\nI sometimes wonder if I\u2019m the one that sucks, or is it the source material? When do you know you\u2019ve done the best you can with what you\u2019ve been given? You can\u2019t polish a turd. \n\nAnd as a newbie dipshit, I\u2019m trying so hard to make whatever I do be super awesome, badass\u2014whatever that means. But, maybe I just need to make the rough mix sound 20% better. I don\u2019t know.\n\nWow! That was long. Thanks for any advice\u2026",

Lowest note on this upright track was hitting about 7db louder than the higher notes. Sounds like the mic was close up to the body/ f hole and not getting enough of the neck. After trying different EQ + compression techniques, automation just sounded a bit more pleasing to my ears. And made it easier to stick with the up and down dynamics of the song. Which is also very up and down. I could compress then ride a fader to match the track, but either way I\u2019m automating. This song is more in the chamber music world and super dynamic, so EQ / compression moves I would do on other stuff felt more aggressive.",

A compressor doesn\u2019t differentiate between a word or phrase that should stand out from the others. That\u2019s why he uses clip gain to level out stuff beforehand. \n\nOfcourse you can make the point of leveling out with a compressor and then automating up poignant words or phrases. But most modern vocal recordings have to be edited anyway so why not go in and do it all there?",

I was using a pretty rudimentary clipper EV had developed but still, even with the modern standards, I find similar results.\n\nI\u2019m definitely having success with them upstream though, particularly on drum bus. I think it\u2019s a great, transparent way of lopping unnecessary transient material before bus compressor and  limiters start doing their thing. That way, I can use those tools more for tune shaping and texture and less for just getting the level up.",

I tend to buy plugins to save time when projects come in. \n\nIn the order I'd range these kind of tools mentioned here:\n\n1. soothe\n2. speccraft\n3. reso and all others\n\nIf you have soothe, you're good imo. \n\nI liked this one (speccraft) because it gave me more control when I needed to chase a more targeted frequency without affecting the rest (i.e vocals, bass gtr, etc), stuff like that, but I use these kind of tools sparingly. cymbals, egtrs cabs, things like that, almost never on the mixbus because IMHO (don't shoot me), soothe-like tools, affect too much of the signal - suppressing resonances/frequencies \"killing the depth\" because of the pushing down of reverbs, delays, etc. That is not to say I never use it, there are times for everything, and every tool has its place but yeah. There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

Freezing tracks first can make it go way faster. As for mixbuss, I take off my final limiter (or turn down the input, however the song was sent to mastering)\u2026 I\u2019m usually not compressing the buss hard enough for it to matter. Sometimes the sum of the stems ends up sounding better than the mix! Generally people are using them for their MD to create a live show, or for dance remixes etc. For sync most people seem happy with instrumental and accapella in my experience so far?  Also if your trying to key your mix buss compressor from a printed mix, freezing most of the session first (besides fx etc and aux tracks) seems to help the side chain feel pretty close to what the mix was. I don\u2019t bother with it though most of the time as I\u2019m doing a couple db at most on the buss comp.\n\nEdit: one other idea I\u2019ve messed with pre soundflow, is, if your just doing subgroups and have the routing setup, save your mixbuss as a track preset and when your ready to print recall it on all your masters and commit the tracks.

The way this is setup is also based around the philosophy of heavily compressed mid range that\u2019s added back in level but remains more controlled. While the top and bottom are only hit subtly to tame peaks. Luca from Studio DMI does this as well.",

I disengaged the limiter and set the compression sidechain to EXT so the compression wouldnt happen (I didnt like that sound of it. Took out punch) and it was a super good enhancer. i even like the high band for smooth air. low band is not really nice to me cuz i like to boost subby lows on the mixbus but this low band reaches too high on the spectrum. So ya, all in all good plugin. may needa grab it. Highly suggest people check it out and report back on here",

Good to hear that it's not just about mindlessly throwing clippers on everything.\n\nApart from that I think doing anything to dynamics is always better if done in stages. Different stages of compression, limiting and in this case clipping, so I definitely think that's a good approach",

    "content": "Come on dude, there's a reason this type of misleading promotional pricing is ruled illegal - at least in the UK.\n\nI'm sure we're all savvy enough in here to understand that marketers earn their wage by exploiting weaknesses (widely documented and scientifically substantiated) in human psychology. The felt urgency created by countdown timers and sale price indicators (\"normal\" prices slashed out, bold colours advertising \"temporary - don't miss this\" pricing etc) causes consumers to make irrational decisions and hurriedly complete purchases they otherwise wouldn't have made. I guarantee everyone in here has felt those psychological pulls. I think that satisfies the definition of predatory.\n\nI was generally aware of rulings here, but looked into examples before posting, so here you go (https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/promotional-savings-claims.html):\n\n\n*\"Ads for a mattress sale which stated \u201c\u201cHALF PRICE\u201d, alongside a box with numbers counting down from \u00a3399 to \u00a3199 were ruled against by the ASA. Over the previous year, the mattress was shown at the higher price for 49.85% of the year, and at the lower price for 50.14%, and the price had alternated between the two each month. Because the promotional periods were essentially equivalent in length to the periods when the full price was charged, the ASA did not consider that higher price was the  established usual selling price (Dormeo UK Ltd, 13 October 2021). Similarly, complaints were received about a sale for Simba mattresses.  The advertiser did not provide the ASA with any pricing history to demonstrate that the usual selling price was genuine, however, the complainant provided screenshots which demonstrated that the reference price of the product had fluctuated over a three-month period, and that the mattress had been on sale for 71% of the year. Therefore, the complaints were upheld (Simba Sleep Ltd, 21 September 2022). See also J Sainsbury plc, 06 June 2018.\"*",

I havent been on that board in a decade but have moved that workflow to the plug-in compressor. Should I be incorporating a VU meter there or is the meter on the SSL essentially doing the same thing ?",

Tradeoffs there. Could also play around with formant shifting some with melodyne or alterboy.

Insane job to u and the rest of the MB crew \ud83e\udee1 (also ur presets specifically r so good)",

    "content": "I'll be honest and say that everything is in flux at the moment. I've installed tons of new plugins these past few weeks and am hunting for inspiration in new workflows. So far the biggest change has been simplifying my mix template bussing -- the hardware chain used to suck out all the subby low end so I would bus around it. Now I can strap the UnF & Sontec across the whole lot and really glue things together, which I'm enjoying. As far as drums, I'm usually leaning much less on the parallel bus and just using the unfairchild for overall compression with good results.",

He has his workflow with lots of reductive eq, soothe, compression and so on, but in the broader picture it\u2019s very much about tone shaping and loudness. A ton of loudness. And then he just slides the fader to just the right place which is such a huge part, but he never talks about it from what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nI\u2019ll mention he was very surprised Jon didn\u2019t mix like this. And the other way around!",

    "content": "I find it's rarely necessary to compress a synthesizer if you're the one programming it. You already have control over the attack/sustain ratio on the instrument using the ADSR controls. And you can balance the harmonics through your choice of filtering or oscillators. Synthesizers rarely have low-level information to be revealed that can't simply be turned up at the source.\n\nOf course, you might want the distortion artifacts from compression, but I'd probably use a saturator module.\n\nThat said, if you're a mixer who has received an audio bounce of a synth, then... sure! Compression would be good for balancing poke-y stuff, controlling boomy low-end, or there could be some room tone from a re-amp signal, or some attack that needs to be accentuated. So compress away!",

Such a quick workflow.

Rarely I get stems too quiet and in these cases I usually clip gain all stems down. \n\nThen I usually have ozone vintage limiter on at -2.5db which will add a bit of loudness with the auto gain and then set the maximizer to +2dbs.\n\nBy the time I\u2019m done doing my thing with bus processing, eqing etc\u2026 I\u2019m usually in a good spot lufs wise and then it\u2019s a matter of turning up or down either the makeup gain on my compressor or the output of the maximized",

    "content": "Loudness question: I\u2019ve been struggling with drum samples and bass/808s specifically. A lot of these sounds come in so dense and compressed, they sound good in level close to 0dbfs but they don\u2019t have the knock and energy they had when they are turned down to create headroom. Especially when it\u2019s playing with other instruments that are more dynamic. A lot of times they even sound smaller and thinner too. So I\u2019ve attempted using samples that have taller peaks but at the end of the day I end up doing similar treatments (distortion, clipping) to get the level of density and aggression. Which also leads to another question about transient treatments. I\u2019ve watched tutorials on this topic and some people used clipper to have the limiter work less, and the others work slightly differently by preserving the peak and using parallel to create density. I tried both ways, but still left me with the issue of not being able to crank it louder without messing things up. With the dense drum samples, the rest of the mix would start choking every time the drums hit. Generally I find it so much easier to get things to compelling loudness when there\u2019s no drum instrument (I find percussive elements with higher pitches easier to fit in the mix). How can I work around this?",

It has random parameter set feature and can unexpectedly bring in interesting sounds quickly too. Other than that, I also like Soundtoys stuff for phaser and tremolos, ubermod for chorusing and other phase effects on the delays. For reverb, Dverb is actually pretty cool especially when it\u2019s mixed in with delays. I like Valhalla vintage verb and eventide ultraverb as well. And for post verb or delay saturation, decapitator and spectre. Saturn if I wanna use the dynamics control on it. I also like messing with the polarity, sometimes flipping it can get the presence of the tail heard better without obscuring the dry sound as much.",

My guy pulled up the stems, pressed play and there was a literal mixed (albeit improvably so) song coming through. \n\ntl;dr: just remember that the nature of the audio your working with is likely vastly different than what someone like Jon Castelli is working with.

To go into some of your questions; I'm using Adam a7's (not the newer a7x's, although I tested them and they're wasn't as much of a difference as I had expected in my room). My room has been treated with diy panels, 14cm thick Rockwool and it sounds decent for a home recording studio. the dimensions aren't great and low lend monitoring isn't top of the charts but it's workable. Any peaks and valleys i did have have been sorted out further as much as possible with sonarworks which has really outdone my expectations. I also use Beyerdynamics dt770 pro's. \nUsually a lot of time does actually go into clip gaining, cleaning up and taking harshness out of vocals. I often take as much time just manually leveling a vocal, taking out esses etc as I do mixing. Fresh air and dopamine have indeed been big helpers and have been big steps towards that sizzle. Also the waves exciter in parallel has been working okay.\nI never seem to be able to get a multiband compressor to work well. Either I'm overdoing some of the setting or something because often i feel like it attenuates too much and other times to little in the places I want it to. I've noticed that a little boost in the low mids on pro-q3 that then also attenuates dynamically can work. \nCould you go into a bit more detail on what you mean with phase bringing a vocal more forward?\nI've also noticed that a lot of the sound I'm looking for comes from a certain sort of rolling kind of sound that might be coming from the rappers throat? I'm not sure at all about this but it seems like it's almost vocal fry but in a very natural way that is inherent to the singers/rappers voice. Idk if this is a rapping technique thing or if this is more accentuated in the mixing process, but it sounds really nice.\nDefinitely a big thankyou for all the tips!",

    "content": "man I need some advice here. got paid up front to mix an album and it's taken over a year to complete, just feeling not worth it anymore. The issue we keep running in to is really terrible engineering and production caked into the vocals by this very large/random span of producer (14 total songs), then the artist says that every vocal feels over compressed (I can assure you that none of it is coming from me). I've told her time and time again that perhaps these notes would have been more effective during production or recording, but it still feels like it's my fault. (also, fun tidbit: her verbage is \"the eq on the vocal feels too compressed\"). she references the mixes on very old Apple earbuds and has the most ludacris notes about the bass n stuff. I'm mixing on PMC IB1s and Airpods, FWIW. just feels like this endless uphill battle where I'm worried I'm running thin on patience.",

I dont use compression for dynamics control either....you may have heard of the \"clip to zero\" strategy? i do a similar thing but then output my limiters/clippers at -6db instead of 0. Its similar to what johns doing just catching peaks and not squashing the life out of everythin....mike dean does it too IIRC. \n\nRe: spectral shaper : I didnt actually spot jon using his spectral shaper in that 1-6khz region, i saw it in the low mids....so having heard you and @oaklandmatt both mention it ...it seems hes defo already using this high mid scoop trick then! Ill still research the maths of the lufs algo because i like to really understand the psycho-acoustics and science of these sorts of things. Im after the ultimate mix in this life, lol .....i come from underground club music, where drums and bass and a sweet vocal are everything so its a constant balance/re-balance between lows/mids and highs as i learn more advanced techniques\n\n..re: jons mix yesterday and clipping, and you mention clipping the attack portion of a sounds adsr , did you notice how much he uses transient shapers on almost everything? v clever. Personally, i love transients and fight hard to keep them and jons trick of putting a transient shaper after a clipper/limiter has been a revelation....(thanks @oaklandmatt , that gem came from your LWMR) .....bruce swedien said compression is for children, and i believe he evangelised about not killing transients ...i love a transient shaper and a clipper ....compressor , not so much.",

It is smart, and for his workflow it\u2019s also fast and easy.\n\nI use compressors a lot, but I\u2019m also working in mostly indie rock with acoustic drums and bass guitars not 808\u2019s and drum machines, which is a drastically different world. I also think I\u2019m doing what most people don\u2019t do and I don\u2019t always love the artifacts of compression so I generally use slow attacks to maintain transients and fast releases to recover quickly (I adjust so that I get the fastest release before audible distortion)\n\nBTW Bruce Swedien while he may have evangelized not using compression don\u2019t underestimate that his greatest works were done to tape and even when you were conservative and didn\u2019t hit tape hard, the transformers going into tape and out of and the tape as a medium itself would peak limit attack heavy instruments like drums",

The drum stems they get aren\u2019t gonna add up to what I\u2019m hearing right? Because they\u2019re going to hit my drum bus compressor one by one?\n\nI think a good example is Disclosure sending Jon the stems for Talk. Guy always has a drum bus with Oxford Inflator, Saturn 2, and an API-2500. But when Jon gets the stems the drums are going to be individually compressed and thus not what Guy was actually hearing right?",

When I send a signal out to a parallel compression track, compress it and then EQ, that EQ will be in parallel to the main signal. Since EQ causes fase shift this could create problems (I think?). I've noticed from doing some test and research that bell and shelve curves wouldn't really have any weird behaviors in this case, only that bell curves would have a slightly different Q and shelves would be shifted up or down in frequency ever so slightly. Filters seem to be where the real problems are, since they introduce a full 180\u00b0 phase rotation in the frequency area around the cutoff (i forgot where exactly) kinda similar to what an all pass filter would introduce but with added shift below or above the cutoff frequency depended on HP or LP. So bell and shelve curves should behave very predictably, but filters would behave in more unexpected ways. It's all kinda messy in my head because of different information sources. The internet is an amazing place but it's really hard to get good, clear and correct information sometimes.",

    "content": "A hard clipper will behave differently than the digital clipping that occurs when you clip your converters or when you export a signal that exceeds 0db at a bit depth of 24bits. Your daw works internally at 32bits floating point, which means that your individual faders will have a lot of headroom above 0 db, so you can go pretty much as high as you want with them, as long as you turn the signal down in a later stage before it hits the final output. Otherwise you will be clipping your converters like you said. This clipping will be different for every converter, and it's why mastering guys buy converters that are worth more than your car, just so they can get a certain flavour when clipping their a/d (although I'm pretty sure most have stopped doing this, because it often just sounds like shit lmao). Clipping your signal with a plugin will introduce different distortion/saturation/artifacts. It will even be different between different plugins and between different algorithms inside of those plugins (if you are able to select those)  (some clipping plugins actually use the exact same algorithms, so those won't have any differences ofc. EDIT: the only differences here would be in the oversampling functionality etc. of the plugins used, not in the actual clipping algorithm. There actually aren't a lot of hard clipping algorithms out there, so most differences between plugins will be in the way the anti-aliasing filters work)",

Mix quiet and you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nForgot to mention, because DT 770s are closed back, making sure you have a good seal and taking breaks are critical. You need a 15 minute break for every hour you put in on cans, bare minimum IMO. Without that, attention loss and fatigue kick in. \n\nTools like tonal balance control 2 are important. I recommend setting up a Pro-MB with 3-5 bands across the entire frequency range but make them all neutral with no compression. Sub, low, mid, high mid, top end. You can monitor specific ranges now. And for sub/low end, you can turn the gain up on your headphone mix a bit, isolate the low end, and you can hear it a bit better. Make sure you turn your headphones down a bit before you un-solo the low or the sub, but this has helped me massively",

THEN you can use something ultra transparent and awesome like a Dave Hills titan to control dynamic on the way in and really increase your chances of keeping the vocal right in the magic spot without risking overs. \ud83e\ude84 You can do it with a studio\u2019s 1176, you just have to figure out the sweet spot before the artist gets there and be willing to adjust on the fly",

    "content": "I can relate to this . I think first impression notes are a great tool and I\u2019m challenging myself to \u201cdo less \u201c not more to roughs:demos . Often times when I\u2019m tracking vocals it is to a two track (rnb/hip-hop) and I\u2019ve learnt that just about any \u201cvocal sound \u201c I want to go for I better get it whilst we are tracking because the artists always want a rough vocal mix to go away with at end of session . Invariably , whatever that rough sounds like I can\u2019t stray away from (for good or bad ) once they\u2019ve heard it . And then when it comes to a final mix , it gets even more complicated getting the actual stems for the two track and mixing it all down with the vocal tracks as it often (imo) sounds better but doesn\u2019t feel the same as that on the day rough vocal mix to the two track . I realised there\u2019s no way I can get an artist to unhear that first  rough mix and I\u2019m wasting hours mixing it all over again with the stems , like I\u2019m re inventing a wheel no one wants . I\u2019ve noticed @Bainz_  telling @oaklandmatt he had the same issues with thugs punk album and also have heard Jason Goldberg and Stuart white embracing the idea that you\u2019re possibly mixing the final mix/pre master as you track . It\u2019s a very raw and quick approach and it does keep you miles away from overmixing something . I embraced it as a workflow only recently and it\u2019s less stressful than working your ass off on a \u201cperfect\u201d mix only to get back they prefer the vibe of the first day mix .   top tips not to overmix I am meditating on currently are : don\u2019t lose your dynamics , watch your phase relationships don\u2019t change , leave some mistakes in , automate more than compress and be quick",

I started moving away from the pres a few years ago just because I wanted more options and went out of the box, but occasionally I still use them when I need the extra channels. In my experience the preamp emulations are a bit noisier than w/o.\n\nI own a black face Apollo 8p and the newer silver face x16. I think the converters in the newer models are far superior than the early ones. I've worked on the past three generations.",

I even had her rerecord her part (to which it sounded better than the first take), but the noises are still present and it's hindering the song from shinning. To be more descriptive it sounds like she is breathing/singing from the back of her throat which causes some type of almost \"snoring\" sound, if that helps?Is there any advice on how to fix this, time is of the essence? I appreciate all your help and advice in advance!",

I found myself having to turn up the low shelf a lot to account for how bright it is.\n\nThe level rider seemed pretty good. And the compressor gets pumpy quick, but it was alright in small doses.\n\nThe doubler felt great and the two verb options sounded excellent, but I could see them being limited because they only have a dry/wet control.\n\nOverall I like that it can act as an instant-vibe plugin for when you want to move quickly through a session. It\u2019s got zero latency, which is great and seemed very light on CPU. But it\u2019s not a fit for every style. Seemingly just for big pop stuff.",

The slowest attack on a SSL GComp is 30ms. \n30 ms is around 33hz, which is around 1 full cycle of the lowest perceivable musical note for us (B0). \n\nI wonder if thats why that setting is so popular. allowing a full cycle to develop, will lets us hear that pure sinewave without distortion while still compressing. \n\nYou could make presets for attack settings for all the 12 notes in the lowest octave. To always have the fastest attack that lets through at least one cycle of the lowest note in the song/key. \n\nI wonder if Letting the tempo decide the release to dictate the kind of groove/feel the song has. Maybe a Rythmic value? a 16th? and 8th? swung 16th or 8th? \n\nFood for thought. I know \"use your ears\" and i do, always. but i just noticed that i and others gravitate towards settings that land around these points of interest and or their multiples.",

Now I grab compressor only when I want compressor pump/pinch or tame pokey transients without adding too much harmonics. \n\nDuring the early phase of this, I was going overboard with saturation and driving stuff and started dialing back a bit.\n\nCian\u2019s mix bus curve and saturn preset changed the way I mix, I\u2019m now less heavy handed and can start from a place of having things sound pretty good- but I do end up having to bypass or back off on them every now and then. \n\nTrying these things made me occasionally deliver something weird at first but in the big picture, they benefited me.",

As an outsider to the major label stuff , it often sounds to me like stuff is pushed way way too hard and comes across as insecure . The substance isn\u2019t there , so the compression gets put in it\u2019s place . If all things mix wise are relative , maybe the big studios mixes need re calibrating a bit with that top end",

Acoustic instruments may take compression, editing and some aggressive band limiting and EQ moves to make it work in the mix, but those moves tend not to work for synths in my experience. So other things need to be done like parameter automation and layering\n\nBass guitar is probably not gonna have as consistent in your face subs like 808s, but the life of it always felt more massive than 808 to me. \n\nSoft synths sound huge on their own because they have very consistent presence but when you turn the faders down for balance, it gets smaller again. So  as many mentioned it takes making it smaller to make it bigger again. I guess this also applies to distorted guitars",

If you're working with a Hans Zimmer style production, the orchestra will record a separate pass of long notes (everyone on the melody/chords) and a pass of shorts (ostinatos and riffs). So if the parts are really that distinct, especially if they overlap, then it makes sense to deliver them split. \n\nI have longs and short notes split to different inputs in Cubase so that I can get granular with how much reverb to add (longs usually need a little bit more to help glue the transitions together), but if they're meant to be performed as a single line, then I would deliver it merged.

Probably a weird one, but I think I'm missing something.\nI've been looking into SSL Bus comp schematic \u2014 there are several going around the internet and based on what I see in SSL 500 unit are quite interesting in a way how the sidechain envelope follower is generated.\nThere are several approaches I see in various models:\n1. Original SSL mixes left and right channels with OR principle \u2014 basically the envelope is generated based on the strongest signal coming from either L or R channels. \n2. Some of the models suggest mixing left and right channels \u2014 essentially you get the average signal between channels which is then generates into an envelope.\n3. True stereo (or rather dual mono with a single set of settings) \u2014 which calculates envelopes for the left and right channels independently.\nSome SSL comp models have a switch to trigger between various modes, but if I understand correctly, none of the SSL original models have used true stereo (fully independant) sidechain processing.",

Sometimes just a compressor directly on the channel will do something similar and less dramatic than ducking if that\u2019s what is needed for the song, \n\nAlso I find faders very helpful in automating effects. Because I don\u2019t always want them to duck in the same shape or ducking is something I\u2019d do to change the nature of the tail and will still need some additional shaping to give specialness to different moments.\n\nFor vocals I like copying the audio track and make separate fx tracks because I only want it on certain words. Even for overall effect, I use a separate track so I can take out certain words from reverb or clip gain them.

    "content": "Yeah, the way I've seen it (and am dragging my feet to start doing on scores) is each group has its own aux, and that aux has (say) a compressor and an EQ on it. Each aux has the identical comp and EQ, and all are grouped. So then you can treat it *like* a more traditional 2bus, but then hit commit to last insert when you're done, and that's it. All these auxes just go through one limiter on the actual master. Of course, you don't get the effect of the proper sidechain on compression this way, but it seems like a decent compromise.",

So far I've used a usual suspects \u2014 pair of COMP-2A and 1176, I've tried my variable gain compressor (which I don't usually use for vocals) and both worked okay-ish, but I was looking for maybe a good plugin so I can streamline my process a little bit rather than bouncing the vocal tracks through hardware all the time.\nAppreciate your input.",

They ended up mixing it themselves, but they did so many of the mutes and changes I did in my mix version.  When they released it they credited me as \"additional mixing by CK Koch\".  At first I was annoyed, but then I decided to listen to each version of the mix critically and try to see if I could understand what it is they possibly did not like about my mix, and what they were going for in their mix. I do feel my mix had light years more vibe and glue and just sounded like a record....BUT....their mix had a really airy top end that was way brighter than how I usually mix.  I think I actually tend to mix too dark, which I have come to realize is very likely because of my monitoring and room. I now see how that extra octave on the top really does add something I wasn't putting in there.",

If you know where the sweet spot of a compressor is on a drum bus for example, you can calibrate 0 on the VU meter to that sweetspot. then mixing into your compressor isn't such a guessing game every time (because you get the needle bouncing around 0, not too far under or not too far over). \n\ni use a digital one on the way out when i'm hitting my analog chain so everything goes out at the relative same level. i use an analog one on the way back in calibrated to a \"safe\" level and i know when it's coming back in ultra hot or i need a little extra gain to get it to the sweet spot. when you're monitoring stays at a consistent level, VU meters can help you judge relative relationships quite easily. i could see it being useful in the use case you described if you've calibrated the VU accordingly. say you want to generally hit -10 at the mixbus...calibrate a -10 signal to 0 on the VU. everything you then feed into the mixbus will show on the VU + or - where you want to end up.",

I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

I mixed the whole thing in one Pro Tools session, with a separate set of channels for each song which I\u2019d then make inactive and move onto the next song. When printing the continuous mix at the end, I\u2019d make active two songs at a time for any overlap, and constructed the long printed mix like that.\n\nIn this case though, there are multimiced drums, bass, electric guitars, keyboards, vocals. The recordings are good (from the stereo board mixes I\u2019ve heard) and the scale is such that I want to have the fidelity I\u2019d approach a studio record with, and the room to shape an identity for each song (while still sounding like they all happened on the same stage on the same night) so I\u2019m thinking to use my usual elaborate drum mix routing with parallels etc, all the bells and whistles.\n\nThis complexity would put me off mixing 23 songs in one session, but I\u2019m thinking of the inevitable crunch at the end of the project and the potential frustration of jumping between sessions.\n\nAm I thinking too deeply about this? Should I just get a drum sound and leave it there for 23 tracks, with a few rides here and there?\n\nNot much experience with this stuff so any thoughts would be very welcome please!",

I will say it's nice to have the vocals all coming out the same aux so I can pop them all down 0.3dB at the end or tame some unneeded brightness. Also not doing much compression on either buss. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

    "content": "\u201cThe Inflator is not the same as the Enhance feature in the Oxford Limiter, although the effects might be considered similar. In simple terms, the Inflator is a special kind of distortion generator which has no dynamic activity over time. It's a static process. It gives the impression of loudness by providing the harmonic cues we associate with loud and stressed sounds, increasing the harmonic density of the material in a way that is sympathetic to the ear.\n\nThe Oxford Limiter's Enhance function is a special kind of 'dynamic' process that does not add distortion to steady state signals. It works over time, programme history, peak and average levels and left/right stereo differences to limit the signal and squash peak events, while providing the listener with the impression that the peaks are still there. It can sympathetically remove peak events so that you can provide more transparent limiting, or make the programme even louder without causing sample value overs.\u201d",

    "content": "And from the manual:\n\u201cThe enhance process improves the perceived loudness and presence of the programme material by modifying the dynamic and harmonic content of the signal. Since the method used is different from the Pre-Processing section, it can further enhance the perceived volume of a previously processed signal, while suppressing all signal overloads. As the limiting action does not involve conventional sample value clipping, harsh distortions are avoided, and programme detail and dynamic information is largely retained.\n\nAlso, since the plug-in has internal headroom, transient levels greater than notional maximum modulation can pass from the Limiter section into the enhancement stage. This means that percussive overshoots, that would normally be lost in a conventional limiter (or would give rise to overloads), may be included within the sonic results of the plug-in, producing both richer dynamic sonic detail and a useful reduction in the perceived artefacts of the limiting process, all without giving rise to any sample value overload.\n\nThis property enables slower attack times to be used in the Pre-Process section, without creating output overloads, which would otherwise result in a need to reduce output levels.\u201d",

(and Pearl, and Milab, and a few others). I build DIY mics from kits and mod existing mics and those diaphragms are all pretty standard, and derivative of old german mics in basically almost all cases. And the diaphragms dominates the sound... it's just fascinating to see a company like Sanken say \"let's put two capsules in a body, optimized for lows and highs, and a crossover\" and have it work so well.",

Let\u2019s say a producer hires me specifically just to consult, take a look at their session and we tweak together then master, but I think their mix is at a 60% and they think it\u2019s at a 95%. That could of course be a conversation and I could possibly convince them to pay a full mix rate if I say I can make it a lot better, but if they\u2019re really hanging on to their mix and don\u2019t want me to change too much, then I feel I can\u2019t do my job and I might not even want to be credited. At that point it\u2019s just a business transaction and not a true collaboration. \n\nI can just see some trickiness here for mixers specifically. For mastering engineers it\u2019s a great deal if they get a higher rate and more control over the session, but for mixers it just really depends on the situation. And for people like Jon and Cian to accept half their rate or less when they can pull their normal rate most of the time\u2026I don\u2019t know where the line is. Of course for long time friends and collaborators with high levels of trust, that could be arranged.\n\nSuper open to thoughts about this, I\u2019m not closed off to the idea at all, it is totally the right move at times with producers who genuinely take the mix really far!",

For instance, you are seeing a waveform that is made of the entire frequency spectrum and the amplitude will be different depending on the sound/frequency makeup of each word. When you just \"make it look even\" and play it back, many times it sounds worse than before. Full-band and multi-band compression+saturation can sound much more natural, and is wayyyy less time consuming. You are able to get a result very quickly and remain objective. \n\nClipgain is very useful...just something to be aware of!",

My question is this: Should I mix these records like they're an album cut (read: loud/hot) or should I approach the mix knowing that there's going to be available headroom in the TV audio mix?\n\nIt's been my experience that loud/squashed records end up sounding puny in TV programming because the broadcast mixers turn it down.

Everything looks fine, but on the last chorus it gets weird. The snare disappears behind the kick when they hit simultaneously. It doesn\u2019t do it elsewhere in the track and I\u2019m unsure as to why. \n\nCould this be some kind of phase cancellation? Frequency masking? I\u2019ve tried to do some sidechaining, dynamic EQ work and flipping the phase but it doesn\u2019t quite do the trick. Almost at my wits end so any pointers for further exploration appreciated!

I've noticed lately, that when I go God Particle to Fabfilter L2, the sides of the music push out significantly more. I've been getting more clarity in the instrumentation of my mixes. The compromise is less saturation, but I think I like the separation (the fabfilter or Ozone limiter was only ever doing 1-2dB of work, but still completely changing that final spectrum. I'm having trouble telling how soon my mixes overload with the Pro L-2 unfortunately. Do you think wider is better? or is a trick and it's too wide, and all that width is overload? I have trouble detecting overload in my Insight2 Plugin, I only notice it on phone speakers after the fact. any advice to help decide?",

    "content": "...im aiming for the dynamic range between the moments where the kick and bass hit seperately...to when they hit together....to be my low end dynamic overall (if that makes sense)....so i dont want to flatten that range there....and instead prefer to compress the kick and bass seprately on their own buses . Im using parrallels of my kick and bass to get my loudness and harmonics, pre Low End Bus . If id want more control id consider a hz-dependent side chain on the bass from the kick, but dont like how that f's with the attack of the bass. Trying to do less processing at all stages......and get there with better balancing ..... So...a tiny bit of  comp on the kick and bass buses (0.5 db slow attack, fast release...usually neutron comp) and only an eq and standard clip on the kick bass bus to only catch random peaks and not jam the final  limiter . i like a littler expansion also , playing around with the pro G expnasion mode is fun",

See, here's my thing with compression: I do like to absolutely smash my bass with compression because I like the sound of a really pinned down bass, and vocals is a given, but other than those two sources, I really don't compress. What I've found is that once I compress one thing,  I find myself going,  \"Oh, this thing needs to be brought up, and then this thing and then this thing...\" and then I end up in a \"loudness war\" with myself. I know tons of people who compress the day lights out of everything, and more power to them. Sometimes I wish I could make it work for me... I also find compression somehow takes away from the impact of things as well, in a way.",

And as far as I can tell and as far as my experience listening to great mixes, all of these things are common across any style except the differences are in how much it calls for and the aesthetic preferences of how each styles like to sit things dynamically. \n\nI\u2019m not a mixer, so I\u2019d be curious to see what mixers have to say about this topic.",

I'm going to add that output attenuator but I'll leave the unit stock. I love the way it sounds! Now I'm curious to hear the ones modded for Electrical Audio though. Did you have the chance to hear them during the St. Vincent recording? Anyway, this is what Greg said about it:\nHello,\n\nYes, my typical modification will change the sound of the preamplifier. The distortion and noise is much lower when the conversion is done. If you are happy with the way yours sounds, you could simply add an output attenuator, like you say. There is a part that is popular in the DIY world for making 1176s.  It is a 3-section 600 ohm \u201cT-pad\u201d potentiometer. You can find it on the Capi website.  \nIf your unit does not currently have a 600 ohm output load resistor, you may want to add a switch to engage the attenuator. Simply having it in the circuit will load the output with 600 ohms. This might lower the headroom and change things a little bit. \n\nGood luck with your project,\n\nGreg Norman",

It would never be my first choice for clean loudness but if someone has mixed into it you can\u2019t replace it with anything else\n\nRe enhance it sounds good but I just had a record this week where the mixer used it on 100% into Ozone Maximizer and it was causing wild crackles. Enhance on its own, no crackles \u2026 Maximizer on its own, no crackles \u2026. but the combination did. I backed off to 50% and changed limiter modes and solved while keeping the vibe. So I guess be mindful if using it heavily on the bus",

I've also used RX De-bleed to try getting a little more separation before diving in so that i only have to melodyne the vocal in monophonic mode. And of course comping between multiple takes is sometimes the only way to go, but not everything is done to a click. What has worked for you?",

But no matter what it ends up with me looping sections and rebuilding the mix to match the rough vibe before I get into the actual creative fun part of the mix.\n\nI have one producer i work with often who mixes into a comp on his all vocal buss and it\u2019s slow and hitting like 3-6 db compression. It totally bones me while mixing so I usually end up rebalancing all the vocals section by section to match his mix before I \u201cstart mixing\u201d. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll just work into their buss shit and bypass the stuff/bands of each of plug that are only hurting and not helping. \n\nReal can of worms tbh. \n\nLast week I ran into the vocal buss issue- luckily it was a comp w side chain input so I did try out the sidechain, I pre fader sent all the tracks feeding it while copying automation to that send, then used a master fader to match the buss sc level to the original comps gain reduction  and it worked well in that situation and untied my hands while saving me from a whole vocal rebalance session. First time that approach ever actually worked though for me tbh. If its a comp that drums are driving into i find the sc input doesnt end up feeling the same usually.",

So the sound i'm hearing is the outcome of all the tracks being processed by this chain, and especially, compressed by the IRON compressor.

When the kick is fed to a compressor on your 808 channel - the compressor \u201clistens\u201d to the kick and applies the compression curve from the kick onto the bass.\n\nSo in your case of printing stems with a mix bus compressor - you want the SPL Iron plugin to \u201clisten\u201d to the entire mix as it heard it before but then apply that compression to one track at a time.\n\nWe can do this in Ableton with some clever workarounds, which would be a lot more efficient to show you on a video call on the server if you are free later.  Essentially you need to print a version of your song at each point in your mix bus chain where there are dynamics plugins (just before the Slate plugin, just before the Iron Compressor but after all the other plugins) and then send that audio to those corresponding plugins\u2019 external sidechain inputs and then you can use the \u201cinclude return and master effects\u201d and get the result you are looking for",

If I'm a little out here and there (usually in the upper mids / highs for me) I'll put an eq (usually Weiss EQ MP or Pro Q3 - something that's not going to add \"analog\" saturation) right before it and make the changes it's suggesting, watching it to see if I got it close.\n\nI think flip the EQ off and on to see if I like it more or less. Maybe half the time I DO like it more, though I often \"back it off\" a little, such that I'm like 50% or 70% of the way to what it's saying would be a \"normal\" mix.\n\nThe other ~half of the time I'm like \"naw, don't like that\" and disable the EQ.",

Then again multiple times on his website etc. etc. I noticed this phenomenon that after listening to his tracks I would lose interest after about 30 seconds. They would sound great at first - all the tape shit and analog gear and whatnot - but I just consistently lost interest in all his tracks for whatever reason. Couldn't listen to them all the way through... Ran into him at the bar and started talking with him about compression and what compressors he uses on what and blah, blah, blah. To my surprise he's a big fan of compression and uses a lot of them at different stages - I think mostly because he has them and he can. Told me about how he'll have one taking off some and then another taking off some and then the master bus taking off some... I know this is a common technique to have different compressors taking off little bits, and one I've started to employ in the box, but I've concluded that by the time his tracks hit the master they're already pretty \"smooth\" and that master just takes the last edge off them - That's why I lost interest in his songs. Not dynamic enough for my ears. The end. Also, the fact that he only uses one inch tape could have something to do with it. The End.",

Me - I only consistently find it useful in two places. 1: Vocals as essentially a volume leveler. 2: Bass - For whatever reason, I really like the sound a very \"pinned down\" bass. Other than that, I haven't found compression very helpful. I'm always hearing of people going crazy with it and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out?? - Especially with drums?? I can see what it's doing when I apply it - to the drums - but I just don't find that I ever produce a very helpful or flattering result... And golly - A little while back I was working on one of my songs with a mixer whom I hold in VERY high regard. He was guiding me through my mix with his methods - Basically using parallel compression on everything, and I remember distinctly feeling several times as though my \"hands were tied\" - The session felt very \"stiff\" with all that going on.

Recently have been using it for back-bus compression, a technique I heard Andrew Scheps talk about which is basically a copy of the mixbus minus drums. Mix bus stays uncompressed or less compressed. Back bus gets compressed more aggressively than I would do a mix bus. Blend that under the mix bus to taste. Really good for locking all the instrumentation together around vocals without dynamics getting pulled around by the drums. I think Andrew uses some kind of 1176 but the idea works with all kinds of compressors.\n\nMix bus and backbus both feed into a 2-bus where more processing may happen. Something like Pultec EQP1q, tape emultion, Pro L2? But I like to change things up!",

Every extra minute spent on trying to iron it all out there will save you hours in editing and mixing. I\u2019ve often considered selling a piece of gear and then had a really stellar vocal go through only to realise there was nothing wrong with the gear. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of reading it but the performance is everything. You can\u2019t REALLY EQ air and body into a vocal that isn\u2019t there. You can\u2019t try simulate it alright. And you can\u2019t create actual excitement with compression, just try and trick the brain into thinking there\u2019s excitement. A 57 into any preamp into any interface with a stellar performance will sound amazing. \n\nAfter that is just treatment, and it\u2019s essentially pointless discussing chains because it\u2019s so song and vision dependant. \n\nA boring answer I know but you\u2019ll save a lot of headache and heart ache the sooner you learn it. \n\nIt\u2019s like when you hear a new compressor plugin just explode a drum room and it sounds amazing. Analogue glue, explosive release, so much groove. And then you slap it on the lacklustre room and performance you actually have in front of you and it doesn\u2019t seem to sound so amazing any more.",

Don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel here. Trying a longer release time and a different compressor IS definitely helping.",

Then I drive it through the free TSC 808 plugin for further emphasize the harmonics the bluey brings out. (EQ too)\n- Then, I use Audreio on the master to play the mix through my phone instead of my monitors. Once on the phone, you can blend the parallel with the bass in a way where there\u2019s little to no audible difference on a monitor, but the illusion of a bass can be heard through the harmonics playing on the phone.\n- It\u2019s a balancing act, but there\u2019s almost always a nice sweet spot to be found where it doesn\u2019t change the quality of the sound enough to be intrusively perceived on HD speakers, while giving life to the bass on lesser speakers.\n\nThis has helped my bass translate to more systems, and is the only time I find myself wanting to use the CLA76.",

There's also the question of more granular clip gain for de-essing or plosives, etc., that makes me wonder what would be overdoing it or what is even needed and how to judge that.\n\nUsually any \"mixing\" or editing I do is related to ideas I create or am part of capturing and have vision/inspiration and get some level of enjoyment out of it. This inspiration usually provides intention or some direction even in my ignorance. In this case I'm completely detached and uninspired essentially, while this makes me more objective, I have a hard time hearing where I want to take the vocal. \n\nI would appreciate some perspective and insight into the granular thought process one might take with the source material I have, having more experience and know-how. I will push through on my own and seek out feedback that way as well, but some live soundboarding would be nice. I appreciate you regardless if you read this and if you have any input at all. ty!!\n\nIf you are interested in listening or discussing it, ping or DM me.

To be fair my question was very open ended since in reality I'm also just wondering how to approach a vocal chain and vocal production beyond simply copying a preset or blindly adjusting settings on various plug ins. Something like an eq, or even other things like saturation or simple sidechain on a reverb is simple enough to somewhat understand, but the culmination of various settings and layered effects does start to get complicated and a bit unintuitive.\n\nI think fundamentally I need more attempts and practice struggling on my own, but I also think it's helpful to see if at some point I can find a bit of guidance or collaboration to accelerate my learning and focus my vision and efforts more efficiently.

I\u2019ve messed with the volume, EQ, saturation, etc., and I can\u2019t seem to figure out what\u2019s limiting it. \n\nI was listening back to it in the car, and I ended up tweaking with the car\u2019s bass settings. Turning up the bass in the car made it sound exactly like what I\u2019m looking for\u2014 only question is, how do I translate that to my mix? I\u2019m not sure if something I need to EQ on the bass bus or the mixbus.\n\n(I also might put a subharmonic but we shall see.)",

    "content": "@Juliette Ok having heard the track, there\u2019s a solo synth bass in there which is well designed sonically, when that drops out and the bass guitar comes back in, everything from about 60-70 cycles and below disappears except for the kick. So yeah I\u2019d first try pumping low end into it, be it with EQ or subharmonic, followed by some (a lot) of compression. I\u2019m sure better people here have a better way to do this. \n\nThe DI itself doesn\u2019t have any overtones other than stuff you\u2019re finding unflattering, so you could try mult\u2019ing the DI signal out to an amp sim (even some guitar amps work here) to fill out the spectrum that the guitars aren\u2019t fulfilling \n\nI\u2019d also say the bass drum could use some augmenting of the low end  and maybe a bit of length in order to emphasise that impact. Because the synth bass atm has all the power, and isn\u2019t omnipresent, so it\u2019s leaving the rest of the arrangement even _more_ neutered as a result",

I think ive heard of people using certain compressors to like add attack to the beginning of consonants and stuff like that.

They all sound cool you really can just build the vocal by messing with the faders. Most important thing to that amount of parallel is that each one is only doing like 1 dB of compression. So sometimes you need pre compression to even things out before they hit all those. And yes you definitely need to pull back some 300 which really starts to build up.

    "content": "Hi there, new here \ud83d\ude42 \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f I\u2019ve been getting more into mixing lately, especially trying to understand transients better. A lot of stuff online focuses on transient shapers, but those are mostly just volume tweaks. What I\u2019m noticing when I\u2019m sound-designing is that transients also feel super tied to little bits of pitch movement. Like, if I make a kick with a soft pitch sweep, it hits way less, but if the pitch shift is more obvious, it feels way punchier. I also saw a video showing that Skrillex snare trick: duplicate the snare, pitch up an octave, chop it so only the short transient stays, then layer it back on top. And yes it slaps. So what do you think about that? If you use a transient shaper to change the shape of a sound over time and then compress it again to tame peaks, what\u2019s really the point? Sorry if that sounds basic, I\u2019m still learning \ud83d\ude4f",

Usually I\u2019m low passing with ISOL8 to listen for limiting/clipping clicks. These artifacts are unable to be heard unless I have a low pass filter active but I theorize that they, along with the extreme compression subconsciously degrade the listening experience by discretely assaulting your ears to the point of needing to take a break from listening. \n\nMy music can be related sonically to clara la sans \u201canother night\u201d give or take more or less busy. (Keep in mind her stuff is cranked to the point of audible artifacts sitting around -7ish lufs integrated across the chorus).\n\nI arrange the mix well and leave 1db of headroom for summing on individual instruments whilst they are loud enough for my target of -10 LUFi across the chorus, meaning my mix is actually 1db louder than -10 with space to sum on the pre master bus. Leaving headroom means I can introduce less artifacts at the cost of having to squeeze the dynamic range of individual instruments more than otherwise.\n\nMy issue is that If I want to aim for let\u2019s say -8LUFSi across the chorus in a relatively clean way with minimal artifacts, I\u2019m forced to squeeze the mix to -7.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear y\u2019all thoughts on whether or not technically inaudible artifacts/distortion matter and whether or not it\u2019s really worth for me to squeeze my mix 2db more in the name of competitive loudness?\n\nPs.
