Part of what makes this community so unique is that people are sharing and participating and not just asking for things. We're here to give and help first, receive second. I definitely don't want to discourage people from seeking help, but I think the best way to do that is to OFFER help, and then sort it out in the DMs. We're doing a great job of keeping it helpful without spamming, so let's keep it that way.

    "content": "Man. I am loving the De-emphasis section on Tupe. It lets you squeeze so much saturation out of a signal without driving things too hard. \n\nFirst, you drive your signal to the point where the loudest part starts to break up, then you use the de-emphasis to subtract that frequency from the saturation circuit and then you push the gain up even harder until you're on the edge of breakup again. Wash, rinse, repeat. \n\nWhat you end up with is a signal that's evenly saturated across the entire frequency range instead of only having the loudest parts treated, because they're all hitting the saturation at roughly the same level. This thing is amazing. It's the sound that I've been searching for for soooo long.",

The monthly tailspin, I know it well \ud83d\ude02\n\nOne thing that I have found to be very helpful to reduce masking / increase clarity  is to simply start by going track to track and listening for / EQing out non musical resonances and non-musical buildups. \n\nI am definitely NOT suggesting the aggressive hyper notching you see in a lot of YouTube tutorials, but a general track to track cleanup of obvious issues. Don\u2019t over think it, only attack the obvious things \n\nHypothetical Examples:\n- weird 1.5k resonant ring in the hats and overheads\u2026notch that thing down a bit. You\u2019d be surprised how much space that takes up in a dense mix. \n- high lead guitar part with extraneous rumble at 200hz\u2026not contributing to the musicality of the part\u2026byeeee\n- piano building up at 300hz in the choruses when everything is competing for midrange - automate EQ in chorus to create space \n\n\nEtc etc etc. \n\nSmall moves like that have made some of the biggest differences for me. Definitely not the fanciest tip, but simple EQ moves have been the biggest contributor to midrange clarity for me.",

Eric came from tape and he was always cranking the high end on the record side going to tape to account for noise on mix down (easier to tame low end than it is to boost when you're mixing off of tape)... but there was a cool high end sheen that you'd get. So with Saturn, you just separate a high frequency band above what is really audible and just crank the gain on the warm tape setting. Obviously you can adjust to taste, but it's a great way to add a little air & excitement to some dull recordings.",

Soft has what I understand to be a \"smart\" floating threshold that kind of rides the signal, versus hard is closer to a fixed threshold (and I believe depth then affects the ratio and threshold in it's own way). So, if you were trying to zone in on a frequency that only occasionally rears it's head, hard mode with a lower depth will be generally more accurate and not affect the other parts of the audio nearly as much. I don't like using Soothe on sibilance, but I actually found it quite effective after learning this by setting it to hard mode with a very broad \"sharpness\".",

And if an Ess is too apparent, you can clip gain it down in the source etc.\n\nPlus once you have your verb throw set, when you in turn commit that throw, whatever it is about seeing the audio just suggests further details like having it cut abruptly on a beat, or reverse it, or fade it in, or EQ it etc.",

    "content": "This is tangentially related, but I think Gullfoss can be a helpful guide-rail for new/intermediate mixers, but it requires commitment to the premise to be effective. I'll explain:\n\nWhen used on the Master Buss, Gullfoss can provide a positive improvement in mixes. The trouble comes if you have a habit of solo'ing your tracks or groups when you mix. When you solo, Gullfoss will adjust it's curve to optimize for the solo'ed sound. This can lead mixers to make changes to the solo'ed elements that are even *less* effectual than if they'd been solo'ing on a non-Gullfoss buss. It can lead inexperienced mixers to chase their tail even more if they aren't careful.\n\nSo I'll summarize it like this: To gain benefit from Gullfoss you have to commit to mixing without solo'ing (generally a good practice), otherwise it will continually re-adjust itself and exacerbate the tail-chasing that comes from mixing and making moves while solo'ed.",

This will only help you if there's some breathiness to bring up that isn't buried at the level of the noise floor.\n\nIf you don't want to do a whisper track + vocalign you can also play around with a Vocoder with the carrier being noise or a sample of breath and blend that in parallel.\n\nI think new whisper track plus vocalign will get you there the fastest and most convincing.",

Also can do something similar across a whole mix / sub groups using standard clips built in filter. Can help get a more focused top. Also can completely ruin things! Fun to play with",

I\u2019ve had it make a mix really work and I\u2019ve had the opposite too.  I\u2019m thinking out loud here but I\u2019d say the downside of mixing in the box is the amount we over think about the things. It\u2019s easy to get into a phase or template and a mindset of what you should or should not do. I think I can be good to  forget some of these \u201crules\u201d  and go back to listening. sometimes it\u2019s good to work into something and it may not be the best right when you Insert it and you might have to change the bass relationship ect\u2026  but at the end you might find yourself in a more interesting place.",

In the past my thought process has been - this element buried in a dense mix is really poking out at xyz frequency, so i'm going to reduce that frequency to make it sound more \"balanced\". (take for example something like a screeching ambient guitar solo or vocal riff sitting in the background during ~big chorus 3~). Lately i've been challenging myself to actually push UP the frequencies that really make up the certain track's identity, then focusing on it's volume in the mix instead. so far this has felt like things in an arrangement each have a more tangible attitude, instead of where I was at in the past where everything was silky smooth and balanced, thus becoming a soft-midrange-soup. The instinct is as simple as something like make believes MBSI strip, with the midrange EQ knob that can boost or cut, where I would usually use it to cut a dense part of that element, i'll now *boost* it and just turn the track down. Been sounding so much cooler.",

It's achievable both ways.\n\nBut since you're having trouble getting your verbs to pop out in the way you want, here are a few things that will get you there. Usually a combination of these things:\n\n**1.** Turn up the verb - Simple, I know.\n**2.** Make space for the verb - Mute or EQ competing elements.\n**3.** Increase your pre-delay time to the range of 60ms - 150 ms. This \"disconnects\" your verb from the source and makes it stand out more. And this sometimes means you can turn it down and still have the clarity. \n**4.** Use an echo instead of a verb - This sometimes does the thing and takes up less space.\n**5.** Use a slap echo instead of a verb - One and done. Gives you that room-y feel without taking up a lot of space.\n**6.** EQ muddy/thick/harsh frequencies out of your verb, so that you can turn it up louder without overwhelming the mix.\n**7.** Gently apply an effect (distortion, phaser, etc) that will make it contrast and catch the ear easier.",

    "content": "It seems like you might be spending to much time in the micro nuances of mixing. (Easy to do that)  try a new approach. Make quick moves and jump to something else, if the kick is too\u2026.. it will remind you everytime you listen. Try  to step back and listen to your mixes like a ME. Is there too much or not enough of a certain frequency range?  Then dive back into the micro move adjust and move on. This helps  you stay in the flow and to not get lost  in the weeds.  In my experience the music tells you most of what you need to know. Tempo has a huge effect on how the low end can work. Density often determines how midrange and upper mid/ high freq should work.  The elements in the mix should be serving particular roles and that informs where things should sit and ultimately equal how it makes you feel. I don\u2019t think very much when I mix but I react to what\u2019s in front of me . \nThe more you do this the more this will lock in. Another thing that comes to mind, is sometimes if I\u2019m feeling like something isn\u2019t right I\u2019ll do a save as or In your example I\u2019ll mute the kick and duplicate it and start from scratch and see if I can beat it. Sometimes order of operations can lead you down certain paths and as other elements enter the original moves might not being working",

I've always strayed away from it in lieu of keeping things fluid for easy recalls. However, since I've been doing 100% of my mixing in this studio and this gear probably isn't goin anywhere, I've been more comfortable leaning on a hardware chain with (what I think are) great results. \n\nFirst, I'm going into an old UTA Unfairchild. This was the first model that came out with the 6BC8 tubes instead of the current 6386 tubes. I always preferred the older model and was lucky to snatch one when Barefoot kicked the bucket. I'm not actually doing any compression, I've just got gain at unity and signal passing through. The second stage is a pair of UTA MPEQ-1's. I *thought* that I was doing a high shelf boost starting at 8.3k going into a LPF @ 22k. \n\nI've really, really been enjoying the sound of this. I notice a little midrange clarity from the unfairchild and I find the additive high end on the buss is much more musical than boosting individual elements.",

    "content": "this is answer might not be the most exciting.\n\nActual Separation does not come from EQ, Compression and Saturation. These are just tool to help manipulate a sound into how you want it to sound. \n\nSeparation comes from Arrangement. If you have a Piano and a Guitar playing full chords in the same octave, you'll never get good sounding separation, no matter how much you try and manipulate the sound.\nSounds are made from a fundamental and certain overtones/harmonics. If they overlap, then they overlap, even if you add a random eq boost on each sound some Freqs apart, because someone on youtube did that. (not that you can't do it, and it wont work)\nBut Instead of removing good sounding parts of a sound forcing them to fit together(whatever that even means at this point), arrange the parts so they naturally fit together with separation. This way you'll be able to act more, creatively and instinctively on how you want the sounds to sound while mixing, instead of fitting a triangle into a circle. As the good old saying says, it starts at the source, for the best results. \n\nFx, in a typical jazz band, often a Bass will play roots on 1 & 3,  a piano will of then play the root and 5th an octave above that, and a guitar could play the 3rd and 7th, and together all the instruments make big full chords while also having their own space. this way there is now plenty of room for a singer or a Sax player to do its thing and not worry to much about cutting through a dense mix.",

To go one step further on the controls for a beginner- If you are using eq, that implies that you have already diagnosed a problem, which you'll be solving with eq. When you think of that problem, what words do you use? (i.e., this is way too dark, this needs a little more highs, that frequency hurts, etc.). \nIf you find yourself talking about broader things like \"highs\" or \"lows\", that probably indicates a wide Q is appropriate. If you find yourself talking about \"that ringing\" or \"the fundamental\", that probably indicates a narrow Q is appropriate. \n\nFrequency, Bandwidth (Q), and Gain are all balance elements, as eq is a tool for balancing frequencies with one another. I'd avoid using the key of the song or phase when considering eq choices as a beginner. Just train and trust your ears.\n\nA tool that can be helpful in training your ears for EQ usage is \"Blindfold EQ\" by Audiothing (https://www.audiothing.net/effects/blindfold-eq/), which is a free EQ plugin with no numbers or indicators for the controls.",

'Descriptive language' = 'frequency' like @NoahNeedleman mentioned feels of limited use depending on whether you are a starter or finisher of the record perhaps. It's all relative and everything effects everything. I've started to imagine my arrangements / mixes in a sort of dynamic spherical (ish) three dimensional anti-gravity space where I can push and pull the objects of my arrangement / mix forward and back or up and down. I am still exploring this model / searching for better language. My producer brain asks is all the information already there. My mixer brain asks what unnecessary information came along with the objects of my mix. You can pull up or out and forward on an object with a shelf or bell shaped boost or you can push back and away or remove altogether the unnecessary information (HPF or low shelf) suspending what remains above. I have been exploring the latter and I think it has benefited my mixes with the perception of height and informing high frequency mix decisions.",

Everything came from Ryan very well cooked with his analog futzery and UAD stuff, so lots of coralling with EQ on my end... not much added compression. Looks like the guitar solo went through my old Federal 864 compressor -- which is wild, that thing works on something every 6 months maybe. Some drums went through my old SansAmp pedal. Lots of the guitars got squeezed with my Scully 280s. The whole album has the vocals going through my BG2 -- although this one has some snippets that were ITB...

You can create a lot of space in your mix by reducing all but a few key elements to mono. Keyboards and synths are a huge offender here.\n\nA lot of mixers/producers assume that the instruments need to be stereo, when in fact it's the *mix* that should be stereo. And the most \"stereo\" mix is often created by panning mono instruments in the stereo field. Getting those pan balances right is going to remove a lot of conflict between instruments sharing similar frequency ranges.\n\nYou can still have stereo reverbs and echoes, but they can often be far more narrow than the default setting of 100% width. So don't overlook narrowing your stereo elements too.\n\nIt's amazing how much you can do with nothing but faders, pan knobs, and EQ.",

    "content": "So for this song I was hired to produce and mix it. I got the stems from the demo and did the production in ableton. Then vocals were recut in London and I was sent a Pro Tools session. I always cut and edit in Pro Tools, so I used this session to comp and arrange the new vocals, but then I wanted to just bring it back into ableton and blend with the existing production. So I bounced the vocal from Pro Tools dry  (no verb or delay) but with tuning and some compression and EQ. Then I used some of the demo vocal and some of the new vocal in the final mix.\n\nI'm pretty comfortable committing eq and compression on my vocals (the confidence of years of doing this... ps you should do it more, it's good for the workflow). But if I needed to go back for some reason I could go back to the Pro Tools session. I think I did go back once to remove tuning on an ad lib that was part singing, part talking. \n\nI'm getting much more comfortable mixing in ableton. The only thing that really sucks about it is that the sessions do tend to slow down when there's TONS of vocals with autotune inserts (the equivalent number of tracks and autotune instances in pro tools does not tax Pro Tools nearly in the same way). So thus far the only way that ableton really works for me to both produce and mix in is if I don't have raw vocals in there. Hence, bouncing from pro tools works best anyway.",

I\u2019ve used the pencil technique before and was surprised how effective it was at taming esses and plosives, but it was a scenario where I couldn\u2019t reach for another mic. Also angling the capsule slightly can help, but you have to be careful not to get the singer outside the pickup pattern. Much like micing an acoustic, you can do some real Eqing just by angling up more towards the nose or down towards the chest. I tend to like a vocal mic a bit lower than most people seem to put it. \n\nAlso, @NoahNeedleman  can attest, if I\u2019m in the session I\u2019m proactively fighting against S lyrics, especially if you\u2019ve decided that that\u2019s the sound you want to aliterate in a verse. Straight to songwriting jail. \n\nAlso, like Noah said re: eq ing esses, you can usually see on pro q3 the shitty part of the ess and eq it out\u2026 because it also tends to be a combination of the singers resonance and the mic resonance, it\u2019s almost always the same across all of the esses in any particular track.

If you grab the brush tool in RX you can hone in on the most audible parts of the noise and create \"fade-ins+outs\" of noise reduction, maintaining top end clarity in your vocal but masking noise at starts, stops, and ends of phrases.

Different math decisions will get you different amounts of ripple, ringing, attenuation, phase delay vs group delay differential, etc. Every compromise imparts a different kind of shittiness. \n\nTo hear two filters that are optimized for absolutely opposite aspects, pull up cleansweep, lowpass something pretty hard, and switch the LPF back and from being a chebyshev filter to being bessel filter.  \n\nWith eyes open one would be tempted to explain the differences entirely as being related to the amplitude ripple differences, but with eyes closed instead of just looking at the filter diagram you\u2019ll hear more time domain smearing in the chebyshev as well. \n\nI\u2019m planning on making an educational video on filter topologies if I can ever get around to it.",

When you learn to do it and to hear it, you learn why it's so important (pulling low end plosives out of a vocal so it doesn't pin the compressor, for example).

Then everything else just gets gradually turned up and processed to fit in with or accentuate those primary parts. I\u2019ll often briefly solo them to high pass and usually subtly low pass, then sneak the fader up and not touch any solos again. Getting a track a little too quiet, and then hunting around with Spectre, an API style EQ, or Sie-Q for a pleasing frequency to accentuate works well for finding a spot in the frequency range. Also I will often aggressively scoop out low mids on sampled/software instruments as I find these almost always have way more weight there than needed in even a minimally dense mix. FX may be added at any point along the line: if I know it\u2019ll be integral to the part I\u2019ll pop \u2018em on a bit while soloing at first, if not I\u2019ll sneak the effect in gradually with everything else playing.

A lot of times I\u2019d put the mic slightly above or below the mouth to have the full spectrum of vocals without accentuation of high mids. The idea is that the voice projects through the mic not to the mic. This allows me to boost natural top end without having to make weird or any cuts on the high mids. Key thing is to keep the pop filter at the same height as the mouth so they don\u2019t start looking up or down to match the height of the mic. That can be detrimental to vocal performance as it strains their neck. \n\nSometimes people record too close to the mic. From my experience, it doesn\u2019t take the EQ too well unless you\u2019re intentionally going for the proximity effect to have a little more woomph. If you\u2019re going for that, dynamic mic may be a better choice. \n\nI would spend some time working with the artists to go over mic positions on zoom before recording. For the vocals that are already recorded, I can\u2019t really say much about what to do because there\u2019s no context, but I\u2019d say try not to over process because that would get things sounding dull very easily.",

Where the \u201cbrightness\u201d of the track is changes so much of how it\u2019s perceived in the track.

There\u2019s a good chance if it\u2019s performed well it\u2019ll turn into a punchy percussive element that adds size and excitement. \n3) make sure it\u2019s balanced with another instrument on the other side of the the stereo field. If you don\u2019t have one that\u2019s playing something similar or has a similar top end, give it the old mono-verb/delay and see if that helps balance and keep it from being too distracting.\nHope that helps!",

I would start by going heavy handed on the most innocuous of the pile-up and see where that takes you. Saturation is a great way of doing this without making things pokey... but might be good to audition with an EQ first to see what zones you should focus in on. Once you have an idea of where you're going, then you can fire up Saturn 2 or Spectre or Neutron and go to work.",

But generally my approach might look something like this: First pull down the volume by a bunch. Then usually you\u2019ll want to add in some transients back again. I like Spiff for this to taste. Then sometimes Master Rebalance by Ozone can be a life saver. Especially if say the balance of some instruments are clashing with the vocal or the 808/bass is too loud in relation to everything else. Essentially I\u2019m \u201cunlimiting the beat\u201d. \n\nThen together with the vocal in the mix I\u2019ll try to shape the beat around the vocal with some subtle (usually reductive) eq moves. Something like dynamically sidechaining a bell on the hihat frequencies to the vocal can help a lot. Or I might also play with Spectral Shape. Some people get good results with sidechaining the vocal as a whole with trackspacer or soothe. Then if I\u2019m missing some super lows or excitement I might throw a Pultec/Bax-type EQ or Spectre on it. \n\nSo ultimately I\u2019m creating as much space as possible and give myself enough headroom to still do some typical mixbus moves.\n\nTo me this removes the need to do anything different on the mixbus.

Wildest Pro-Q curves you ever seen, split across a bunch of tracks with different EQ and compressors for each word in some cases.

Mark Ralph was mixing it, and at the time I might've had a bit of a \"huh, Zdar's supposed to be a professional, why is the hi hat on the bass channel\" sort of bullshit attitude, but that particular instance cleared that right out. Mark's response to anything like that was always pure acceptance and understanding that people work how they work and it's his job to do what he can with whatever he receives.",

The instances are running on AUv2 and you'll need Pro-Q3 also to use the device.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/qc2z8z22klxxlxq/AAA0NZWQduIfAqgOznLadmECa?dl=0\n\nI'm planning on doing all 8 channels eventually as well as 7.5IPS and a pass on both speeds with higher gain settings, but it's pretty close honestly - close enough for stems or quick recalls was my goal.",

Not every producer is able to switch hats and approach their sounds the way I do (though of course some can).

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

I\u2019m mixing and mastering, and I have a manager and an assistant. We\u2019re constantly trying to improve our workflow, but some weeks are so busy that it\u2019s hard to keep balance, and I end up overworking.\n\nHere\u2019s my current workflow: I use Asana for project management to keep track of all projects. When something is booked, my manager adds it to Asana, and I assign it to my assistant to prep the mix session for me. Once it\u2019s ready, we schedule it in. I try to do one mix a day (sometimes two..) and then handle masters and revisions for previous projects in the afternoon. But this often gets moved around because mixes or revisions take longer than expected.\n\nFor those of you managing multiple projects, what\u2019s your delivery time like for mixes and revisions? How do you schedule how long a mix will take? How do you decide how many mixes to do in a day while still keeping a clear mind?\n\nAnother issue I\u2019ve been facing is communication. Some artists text me on WhatsApp, others on iMessage, Telegram, email, or Instagram. I\u2019ve tried centralizing to email, but it\u2019s impossible. So I keep all revision notes on the Notes App in a folder to keep track. I try to do \u2018Inbox Zero\u2019 but it\u2019s not easy. How do you deal with managing communications across so many platforms?\n\nSorry for so many questions, haha. I just had a burnout and was a brainless zombie for two weeks. I\u2019m trying to optimize so it doesn\u2019t happen again \ud83e\udd74\n\nAny tips, tools, or advice would be super helpful!\n\nThanks so much! \ud83d\ude0a",

I find that this is a side effect of everyone having the ability to be able to record from their home or wherever. It\u2019s becoming more rare to have a record made with the traditional producer/engineer team working on a record From beginning to end. It\u2019s more common a band will come in and track basics take it home for a few weeks try a bunch stuff out in their untreated room where they really can\u2019t tell if they are adding something to the arrangement that\u2019s muddying up a the song or if it  needs a different mic, positioning or eq ect. Or if in fact  it\u2019s an orchestration issue.  Regardless they add it and send it to a mixer and say it sounds shitty because it hasn\u2019t been mixed yet.  This is where I disagree with the whole \u201cthey\u2019ve been living with it for however long so just make everything better than what they had\u201d. Serban says somewhere down the line decisions haven\u2019t been made. So even though I might get push back I\u2019m going to try to do whatever  it is I think will make the mix better even if it\u2019s crossing over into  the role of production. I can always give them back what they had but often the mix needs some things muted and calls for some big moves when the scenario above happens. I know some productions are not this case and require light lifting but in my world that hasn\u2019t been the case.",

I can\u2019t really think of a reason why I\u2019d share fx unless I want something to melt together.  The fx end  up routing to their prospective group, for example vocal verb would go to vocal group ect and can be processed together if needed. I would almost never insert a verb on an individual track unless I want to push track back more into the mix. Or if I want a verb throw that simultaneously  turns the track down as I turn the verb up.  This is also the primary reason I don\u2019t like inserting fx on a individual track. If you turn the fx up you are also Turing the dry down and in most cases I\u2019m not trying do that. Also tend to process my fx, sometimes compression or saturation and also sometimes send fx to other fx. Example a delay feeding a verb",

Find a sound that sounds like you want it to, that doesn't have any low ned problems. now try a do a High-pass filter and look at the peak meter. It will most likely peak higher than it did before, with no audible benefits. Only do a High-pass filter, if you need to remove low-end, thats creating a problem or taking up space. low cutting to *be safe* is generally not great practice. Also if you do a lot of low cuts, vary the cutoff points or you will get a build up of that frequency. Lets say if you low cut everything at 100Hz... you will end up with a bump at 100Hz.

Starting with the biggest section of the song helps as well. I can then automate the other sections up or down *including the master fader feeding the 2bus*  As far as clipping/limiting on sources/busses I find it good to shape the sounds how I want (more heavy lifting) then the busses/2bus end up just glueing it together with a lighter touch.

    "content": "Yeah dude - it has essentially all of the features of ValhallaDelay already built in... so how i do it is I find the right time pocket (1/4, 1/8, etc) and then set it up in a rack. Then i will mess w the EQ settings of the delay signal to give it the right freq content. I personally only use the ping pong and stereo modes (never really use the M/S). \n\nThen in the third tab i set up the ducking  and mess with the threshold and release settings to duck out of the way of the lead. I love the sound of the echo swelling up after the phrase is done so i'll usually start at -15 for theshold and ~100ms for release and experiment from there. that third tab also has noise, gate, and a wobble option to add some more character. Then just like the diffusion setting in valhalladelay - you can use the reverb and decay settings to add verb to the delay signal pre/on feedback/post in the chain to give it more softness/space. \n\nBut the killer feature is then you can modulate these settings in the 2nd tab... then i add a little percentage change to one side of the ping pong delay ~1.3% so it's not completely locked in and just adjust settings from there. on the first page, you can also drive the input super hard to get a distorted sound and bring down the output level (like a preamp). It's super versatile and you can get big swelling verb echoes or overdrive space echo type sounds.",

It\u2019s that hardware LPFs don\u2019t have anywhere near the same amount of cascading delay differential. I.e. a software bass synth by default has a slight reverb that is phase canceling itself wellllllll into the passband (like all the way down iirc) just by the nature of it having a digital LPF bottlenecked at 44.1, where a moog filter has very little of that going on because the sample rate of the real world is infinite, or the speed of light, depending on how you look at it.",

The warmth slider that makes a sound feel warmer or cooler is super fun to me. It's not transparent, but the limiting is gentler, so I like it guiding a sound into its place. Its goal is to make the overall artifacts of limiting more pleasing\n2) I find it faster, more versatile, and better for limiting than a Vari-Mu emulation. Not to mention the UI is way more helpful than what I'm used to with a plugin looking to remind us of a Fairchild or similar\n3) Yes, it just doesn't brickwall, and it has a vibe\n4) You don't Need Tupe if you have a saturator you already like, but I adore it. I was skeptical at first, but I demoed it on drums, and it changed my life. Always on drums and bass guitar for me. Again, Goodhertz's UI makes it more versatile than any other Tube and/or Tape emulator I've seen. It has a million options to tailor the saturation. The Opto Compressor and simple EQ are fast and versatile. It sounds good",

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering  Thank you ruairi . I appreciate it . Starting with the vocal is actually a very pertinent point for me . \nFor this body of work I\u2019m going  through currently the vocals are all tracked to a 2track instrumental but  with most of the songs  I\u2019m importing all the instrumental multitracks  into a new alternative of the mix and ditching the stereo instrumental , much for the reason you\u2019ve pointed to there . \nThe balance of the instrumental sounds excellent to itself but once you start mixing the vocals , they really need a re balance of the instrumental mix elements to allow space . So this has had me listening to the vocal alone first at length and then bringing back the instrumental elements very much around it. I was thinking yesterday how remarkably different a balance was needed to give the vocal its place.  It feels like trying to matchmake two friends who are going to be great together if you can just find the right setup , \nMain weapons (of love ) have been faders , panning and gentle eq . All of which I learnt how to harness their true power here . I\u2019m back at it again this morning and feel great about the challenge again and do love these songs . The artists are telling true stories and speaking their truth in them and that\u2019s what drives me to excel with a project \n\n\nThere\u2019s also an addictive joy and fear dynamic here atm as I continue my ever deepening realisation that there is no perfect mix to find and attach myself to ! \n\nI have to remain open for the \u201cfeeling \u201c right ? Ha ha . This is Some mystical stuff we engage ourselves in I swear \n\nThanks Ruari , best wishes",

I've recorded not-so-great rappers through nice chains and mixing wasn't the answer to save a (lacking) source. It never gave you *that* feeling. But even if you are recording great rappers cheaper mics tend to lack body and rarely have \"boostable\" or pleasant top end as you said. So it's a bit complicated before you even get to \"mixing\". Felt that was important to mention so you're not too hard on yourself.\n\nBut assuming that the limiting factor really is just mixing there's a bunch of options. First things first: is your monitoring and listening environment decent? Or are you on headphones? This could make placing vocals even harder for you. \n\nThen do you have a process that starts with vocal cleanup to get rid of or reduce unappealing harshness or performance issues? Despite being simple, people tend to skip basic tools like clip-gain to even out a performance. This should usually also give you some leeway for strategic boosts. Maybe instead of EQ look at harmonics. Fresh Air by Slate is free. Gem Dopamine is nice. Spectre is great. All of these should give you that \"sizzle\" you might be missing.\n\nThen to get the presence and even out the performance you could try some parallel compression with something like an 1176. Also, try out Multiband Compression with the Mcdsp 404 or C6 or whatever you have to control the performance throughout the song once you've got a vocal sound you like.\n\nI also find mixing the 808 & drums together with the vocal the most useful when it comes to gain staging and getting the song to feel right.\n\nObviously, there's more that could be said but I find processes more helpful than tools. It's art at the end of the day. Attached what Serban's assistant sees as their/his \"mixing process\". Mix more and experiment with what you have. Get feedback from the artists.",

Another thing I'd try if you have it is soothe2 if you can get it to mostly work on that resonance without killing the tone (even maybe these both in combination) and then finally I'd try something like Saturn or Kclip in multiband and try and use a combination of dynamics and saturation within that band to tame it further.  If it's really bad maybe a combination of those 3, or just automating an EQ but that sounds grueling and time consuming if it's throughout the entire performance.  Maybe Surfer EQ could also accomplish this but I don't have that plug.  I also think there's a Surfer EQ type function in Nectar or Neutron?  Somebody that knows Izotope's stuff better than me can probably chime in.\n\nMy 2 cents and probably there are some better solutions out there but this is where I'd start personally!",

    "content": "A huge majority of the work I do is tracked at home by indie artists and I'm often wearing a lot of hats with a \"mix\" that can vary from a track that hits my inbox completely edited (timed, tuned, audio cleaned) and I can sit down and mix a track in one sitting (2-3 hours) before I feel good about sending it off.  That situation for me almost always involves programmed drums or drums printed by the artist with a committed sound.  However, that being the ideal I can also be completely transforming and recovering tracks that arrive with tons of noise, resonances, artifacts, clicks, multitracked drums not phase or time aligned, sloppy super dynamic playing etc, vocal timing and tuning.  On that side it can take days and days, weeks and weeks, or even months off an on depending on the artist and track count.\n\nMy advice on projects like that #1 is make sure you are negotiating your rate based on the extra work expected of you and #2 try and compartmentalize so that you are doing all the dull tedious work separate from the creative mixing.  Take a lot of breaks, and make sure you are communicating with the artist to manage expectations on why things are taking more time.",

Think of it like changing the tension point on a guitar string by placing your finger on a fret to change the pitch, but at arbitrary points set by how tense your muscles are, and each muscle in your neck and face is acting as a mini speaker driver pushing out these random ass harmonics rather than a nice harmonic structure built off of the fundamental.

Maybe multiple midrange elements will be competing, but the ear can only focus on one at a time (in addition to the drums, bass, and maybe vocal) so YOU choose and shift the focus!\n\nMy second approach is to take two or more of the competing tracks, say kick and bass, and play them together. No point in soloing one. EQ one while listening through it to the other. You may notice that you can subtract quite a bit from the bass without losing its character, but the kick\u2019s punch is improved by the space you\u2019re carving out. I do this a lot with vocals, too\u2014focusing on the vocal inside a dense mix while subtracting from all the other stuff that\u2019s stepping on it.

I love the way MAAT Santa Cruz does this ever so smoothly. \n2. I compress the bass with a compressor sidechained to a LPF(!), to get some low end body which is usually severely lacking. The LPF is set between 1000-2000 hz, attack 0-8 ms and release 200-400 ms depending on the tempo of the song/bass part. Reducing 3-5 dB on peaks. This gets me really far.\n3. If the bass is a shortscale, I\u2019ll use Goodhertz Tiltshift to move the low mids from around 200 hz to around 100 hz, out of the way of the guitars. \n4. Then I put an amp emulation on the channel. Whichever one floats your boat. Plugin Alliance B15, Guitar Rig, TSE BOD, whatever. I\u2019ll be boosting low end and cutting high end here, or before with a separate instance of Tiltshift. \n5. If I want the bass to sound \u201erock\u201c and cut, I send it to a parallel distortion, which can be anything. I like TSE BOD, which is another sansamp copy which  has a lot of sub.

    "content": "Towards @peterlabberton's point re objectivity and consistency... I recently wrapped up a slightly unusual 3 year \"experiment\" on myself.\n\nFor various reasons, I decided to narrow down variability in my life and rely heavily on routines. It wasn't scientific at all - the journals wouldn't touch it - but I set up a structured life with the same waking and bedtimes each weekday, similar exercise routines, identical breakfast every weekday at 8am (quantities measured), the same salad (Greek, since you asked) every weekday at 1pm for 18 months (then I switched to a tuna salad I liked and stuck with that for 20 consecutive months), and one of four batch cooked dinners at 6:30pm that I would rotate roughly weekly.\n\n[I've started typing this and I'm realising I'd need to spend far more time than I have right now to demonstrate the depth of my findings and their Nobel prize eligibility, so I'm just going to wrap it up semi-flippantly]\n\nSome takeaways:\n- When stuff started sounding bad to me like clockwork at 3:50pm every day, I knew it that it was not the mix turning sour - it was just time to eat my 4pm apple. The sugar would kick in, and hey presto, we're back in vibe town. Removing variables can be helpful in diagnosing issues - the diagnostic problem solving approach one develops as a studio assistant can, to an extent, be applied to ones self.\n\n- Limiting variety mitigates decision fatigue and frees up quite a lot of brain power. I like to think of myself as a less dead Steve Jobs - he wore polo necks, I ate greek salads. We both got a lot done.",

Super handy for lots of functions - either very precise and malleable gate open and close on the audible drums themselves, but also for instrument sidechains, maybe Pro-MB ext input on a bass track, a sine generator under the kick / noise generator on snare, the Slate Trigger feeds etc. \n\nHaving the gate triggers as audio allows you to slide them a couple samples back and forth as needed for groove or faux lookahead. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s easier ways to do things (it\u2019s a somewhat old school technique), but making them is one of my prep steps and they do get used in every session.",

It\u2019s almost always an eq question for me\u2026\nOf course I never stopped using compression so we may be on different paths. And of course Cian is 100% right. Now that you\u2019ve learned the \u201cwhy,\u201d it should be very easy to hear what the comps are doing and how to use them to benefit your tracks.",

The manual says it has auto gain to compensate for altering the input level, but with whatever material I was using I didn\u2019t hear any difference. To the point I actually assumed it was just glitching and the dial didn\u2019t work. \n\nMoving to a better monitoring environment coincided with a pro tools update where touching any of the Ruby controls during playback causes errors and stops playback, so since then when I\u2019ve used Ruby I just flip it on fairly early on in the process and mix into it with a high and low shelf and \u201cpreamp\u201d on. If that isn\u2019t the move, changing the settings is so laborious that I just use the UAD Pultec and dial that instead. Writing this now it sounds ridiculous \ud83d\ude02 But sometimes the gentle smiley curve with the kind of softening effect the \u201cpreamp\u201d button has (it sounds like it just dips hi mids around 3k gently) makes things just sound like a record and I keep it on. \n\nNow I\u2019m keen to check again and see if it does something I just couldn\u2019t hear before.

You upload your VO's and it builds out a transcript for you. You then can edit the transcript and it'll chop up the audio accordingly. It works better when the VO's are isolated/have no bleed and not recorded in the same room because bleed can mess up the transcription, but if Descript is analzying just one VO at a time, it works great. Then, you can export an .aaf and upload into PT to make fades, mix, etc. Check it out! I've used it too and it's kinda crazy. Prob the only useful AI thing I've come across. \n\nhttps://www.descript.com/",

    "content": "So, I\u2019m a long-time follower of this thread, but have been to scared to post any questions as I\u2019m afraid to look like a total dumb ass\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a singer/songwriter/guitarist who has been teaching myself how to record/mix over the past few years. I don\u2019t totally suck, but I have a long way to go.\n\nI\u2019m working on a mix for a client\u2014yes that\u2019s new for me\u2014and I want to kill myself \ud83d\ude42\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a big, dumb rock song (I.e. Foo Fighters), and I can\u2019t for the life of me reign in the drums\u2014in other words, there\u2019s freaking cymbal bleed in EVERY mic. So, I have this situation where I tame the shitty cymbals\u2014then get something that sounds like kick and snare samples playing along to a vacuum cleaner. Mostly because I\u2019ve put every stinking plug-in like Soothe, multi-band compression and dynamic EQ on the overheads and rooms. Yeah! My cymbals don\u2019t poke your ears out\u2014but, they also sound like a Rumba.\n\nAnd gating did not work as the drummer is hitting his shitty cymbals on every freaking beat! I ended up sampling a god forgive\u2014clean snare hit and using that as a sample. It\u2019s okay, but without being able to raise the level of the rooms and overheads, I\u2019m kind of fucked.\n\nI found myself referencing this Joel Hamilton production/mix of a Highly Suspect song as it\u2019s kind of similar to what I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s on Puremix. He\u2019s pretty amazing. And while the music isn\u2019t my thing\u2014it sounds awesome. His mix sounds big and organic\u2014while mine sounds like an electric ham sandwich.\n\nWithout hearing the song, I don\u2019t know how much advice I can expect. I just mostly want to vent\u2026\n\nI sometimes wonder if I\u2019m the one that sucks, or is it the source material? When do you know you\u2019ve done the best you can with what you\u2019ve been given? You can\u2019t polish a turd. \n\nAnd as a newbie dipshit, I\u2019m trying so hard to make whatever I do be super awesome, badass\u2014whatever that means. But, maybe I just need to make the rough mix sound 20% better. I don\u2019t know.\n\nWow! That was long. Thanks for any advice\u2026",

A lot of my bread and butter is contemporary classical/microtonal/experimental music and I'm in this world as both an engineer and often as a producer keeping track of how folks relate to the score and each other, take maps, etc. I tend to agree with some of the above that trying to chase down inharmonic relationships with EQ can make things worse, but I appreciate @LAPhill posting about bassoon/flute overtone series. @spectrummasters original question was about understanding the low mids and how they relate to EQing depending on the key; I think for me the way that understanding overtone series, tuning systems, and musical interactions in acoustic/orchestral instruments can relate to pop or rock mixing is like... Sometimes when I hear clashes between instruments playing thirds or clashes in the harmonic series and I'm trying to clear space in the mids/low mids, I do think about what instruments want to be occupying that space. So perhaps in the bassoon/flute example, I'd want the flute's fundamental to be stronger than the bassoon's first harmonic at C5, and that might look like EQing down the bassoon in the ranges of the flute's fundamentals, or in a rock mix looking at the bass's harmonics compared to where the lower range of the guitars are living. Obv instruments are moving and changing notes so none of this is surgical so much as the keys of the songs or the instruments' ranges might inform some general decisions about where to make space rather than just \"cut 300 on the bass\" or whatev",

I have it set up so the 1 key is pitch center, 2 is pitch modulation, 3 is pitch drift, 4 is time tool, and I forget what 5 is off the top of my head haha. I always found the right-click-to-change-tool workflow super cumbersome. Having key assignments makes it a breeze. My left hand is on the keyboard changing tools and right hand is operating the mouse at all times. Not sure if something similar has been mentioned already but wanted to share as it sped up my Melodyning drastically!",

Usually with EQ to darken the panned elements. My master buss ends up being *very* minimal and open to keep me from tying my hands at the end stage.\n\nThen again, I'm also not Luca or Frank.

Lowest note on this upright track was hitting about 7db louder than the higher notes. Sounds like the mic was close up to the body/ f hole and not getting enough of the neck. After trying different EQ + compression techniques, automation just sounded a bit more pleasing to my ears. And made it easier to stick with the up and down dynamics of the song. Which is also very up and down. I could compress then ride a fader to match the track, but either way I\u2019m automating. This song is more in the chamber music world and super dynamic, so EQ / compression moves I would do on other stuff felt more aggressive.",

The deadline isn\u2019t particularly tight so I had the leisure.\n\nI think depending on where you are in your career, it can be really helpful to use someone else\u2019s mixing philosophy as a learning tool, but if people are coming to you for what you do, client projects are probably not the time for that.  \n\nIn my head there\u2019s a pretty big difference between exploring a new reverb plug to potentially generate some inspiration and deciding, \u201con this project I\u2019m SIDE-CHAINING EVERYTHING\u201d when that hasn\u2019t been your thing in the past.\n\nBut also, I don\u2019t really think about this that much, and I think you\u2019ll probably have to develop your own feel for what\u2019s appropriate for you.

I tend to buy plugins to save time when projects come in. \n\nIn the order I'd range these kind of tools mentioned here:\n\n1. soothe\n2. speccraft\n3. reso and all others\n\nIf you have soothe, you're good imo. \n\nI liked this one (speccraft) because it gave me more control when I needed to chase a more targeted frequency without affecting the rest (i.e vocals, bass gtr, etc), stuff like that, but I use these kind of tools sparingly. cymbals, egtrs cabs, things like that, almost never on the mixbus because IMHO (don't shoot me), soothe-like tools, affect too much of the signal - suppressing resonances/frequencies \"killing the depth\" because of the pushing down of reverbs, delays, etc. That is not to say I never use it, there are times for everything, and every tool has its place but yeah. There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

The more you\u2019re actually close to something that could literally be an acoustic event(meaning it could play out that way if you were recording both parts live simultaneously), the less phasey it will be. If vocal doubles are too close to the lead sonically, for example, they can end up sounding like a phasey reverb instead of adding punch. So definitely use a different mic. Like, even Freddie Mercury\u2018s background vocals can sometimes sound a bit one-dimensional because of this, though of course Queen\u2018s performances were utterly amazing(it usually was just one u67 they tracked with)",

A lot of the time I like to pick two elements that are holding it down throughout the track (maybe guitar and Rhodes) and then hard pan those in opposite directions. This maintains the balance left to right.  So I guess try hard panning a mono element and then balancing it out with a totally different mono element the other side.",

But what if you convolved your audio signal with a fixed EQ curve that is 1 sample in duration?\n\nAs we all know, using a normal EQ imparts phase shift around those frequency bands, and an EQ curve with *lots* of bands, is likely to be a big, smeary, mess that distorts your phase relationships.\n\nWhat if you took a big complicated EQ curve (like the type that you'd see on a Sonarworks correction curve), sampled that, and then used it with a convolver plugin to re-apply that same complex filter to your mix buss? Would this method sidestep the phase shift that you get from using traditional EQ bands?",

    "content": "Convolution is a strange technique to describe in a way that is intuitive to understand. But here goes:\n\nIn convolution you have two audio signals, your *input signal* and your *impulse response*. The simplest description of what convolution does is that it multiplies the *input* signal by the *impulse* signal and what it spits out is a new audio signal that includes only the frequencies and amplitude values that both signals have in common.\n\nPractically speaking, what this means is that when you convolve an *input* (let's say, a full frequency drum kit recording) with your *impulse* (let's say a 5 ms burst of white noise that was hi-passed at 500 Hz). What you end up with is a drum recording that sounds like it was hi-passed at 500 Hz.\n\nThink of it like how a vocoder works (which isn't that different). Your vocoder might combine a full-frequency synthesizer patch (input) with the frequency contours and time content of your voice (impulse/carrier). But if your voice doesn't have 100 Hz in it then we never hear the 100 Hz from the synth patch because the input and carrier/\"impulse\" don't share that frequency. What you hear is what both signals have in common. If your voice has a huge peak at 1.5k, then the synth patch is going to be accentuated in that same way.\n\nSo. What I'm saying is that if I have a complex EQ curve (ala Sonarworks corrective EQ) that I use as my *impulse response* and convolve it with, say, the output of my stereo buss, will it impart that frequency curve onto my mix *without* the phase shift that you'd get from a traditional FIR or IIR filter (aka traditional EQs)?\n\nIn short, I don't know because it's hard to search for the answer online. But I'm throwing a hail mary in case we've got any DSP nerds in the forum.",

It begins to work particularly well in conjunction with instances of neutron and ozone eq on your mix inserts because you can adjust them from within tonal balance control without leaving the plug (if I recall correctly ). The neutron eqs are handy again if you want a quick Visual of Where masking is happening , as all the neutron eqs \u201cspeak to each other \u201c and will display masking between channels in any of the eqs. I found the isotope environment really really useful whilst getting my ear training in . I\u2019d never recommend the mix or master assistants but the crosstalk between their mix and master plug ins are really brilliant imo , fwiw",

The standard wild stuff going on...huge amounts of gold clip, all the new ozone bells and whistles, etc etc. Which aren't inherently bad but in my monitoring I can normally just get rid of it and use a simple EQ or something -- and I'm talking huge improvements. I think it's just down to a fresh perspective and great monitoring.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of it honestly, I don't plan on changing how I operate, the move is always to get artists and producers to great mixers IMO whenever possible, and I love the team aspect of that, I think the art is better for it.",

My OG mix had this really aggressive edge to it that I kinda liked but it also felt way too scooped in the low mids. I checked out my old session and turns out I had cranked a ton of 8khz on the mixbus (a move I haven't felt compelled to do since 2021). Related I've been really enjoying thick / dense / full bodied mixes that still have excitement / edge up top especially for vocals and I had previously struggled to achieve a similar 'heft' in my own mixes compared to what I was hearing. I think in the past I was too quick to zap low mid resonances in my vocals / guitars. So I've been experimenting cutting less down around 200hz-600hz and emphasizing more. But then I felt I was losing some of that edge / excitement by see-sawing too much with the low mids relative to up top. I've found cutting some 170hz clears much of that up for me (like oh hey there's my snare or more room for kick / bass), I achieve the thickness above in that 200-600hz range and balance that with the excitement around ~8khz. Pushing and pulling.",

    "content": "Same situation here, I used to avoid the \"reality check\" at the beginning of the mix so I could move primarily by feel. But then I was consistently making macro EQ moves on the mix bus in order to match the references a bit more at the end of the mix (typical 2db presence boost, maybe some 200-300hz scoop). This was a real pain in the ass, cause naturally things change a bit at that point and it's not an effective way to handle the problem. So now I have a preset for MetricAB with 8 reference tracks ready to go that I listen for short periods of time, sometimes 5 seconds or so, just to keep my years calibrated to what \"normal\" feels like in a macro-level. The fact that I don't need to leave the DAW environment (changing the visuals as well) to open a streaming app with different stimulus makes it really convenient to just do the right thing and compare apples to apples. The band-isolation mode really helps me to compare how different frequency ranges are moving also",

Tradeoffs there. Could also play around with formant shifting some with melodyne or alterboy. Could also experiment with high passing some of the layers up a decent bit to create more height / contrast",

To me, this might entail levels, EQ or group compression, but really the main detail that pops in my brain is panning.

If you are flying them you\u2019ll want a case and they barely fit into a backpack.  I\u2019ve also gotten used to running them with an EQ to fill in the 2800hz dip, which makes taking them around tougher as a plug n play travel option.  They also bleed as open back cans so your neighbors in public spaces will definitely hear you working.  \n\nAPM I personally trust less for work as a reference with my ears but the pros outweigh the cons so heavily and they have a high utility outside of work as a travel headphone.",

So I'll give you my general observations and y'all can take me at my word.\n\nI dropped the input signal to -20dB and then played around with boosting at 100Hz (where my test tone is) to see if the harmonics were different for different EQ band types. I tried a *bell*, a *low shelf*, and a *tilt shelf* to boost.\n\nI was able to boost it +16dB in both *subtle* and *warm* mode before I got any of that harmonic breakup that we started to see in my previous tests as we got approached -0.03 dB. It appears that distortion on *subtle* mode (once again) doesn't kick in at all until the output signal gets within -4dB of 0dB on the output meter. The *amount* I boosted did not matter. The distortion only came when the signal crept close to 0 on the output meter.\n\nAll three band types appeared to behave the same when it came to harmonic bloom.\n### tl;dr:\nI did not detect any difference in behavior with different EQ band types. So they appear to behave the same. It's looking like the breakup doesn't kick in until the output level of the signal is within -4dB of 0dB on the output meter. *Then* they start to break up.\n\nThe only exception is the 1st order harmonic at -22dB that appears as soon as you enable *warm* mode. That's always present, no matter how hard you're driving it.",

If you\u2019re gonna go for the modern sound but still record acoustic instruments, tweezing out nasty resonances with EQ plays a big role\u2014no way they could do that with 1073s. Also I think moving to (good sounding) digital made a big difference: you could get loads more bottom end, which was really taken advantage of in the best way with hip hop setting the bar for what we expect in that regard.",

Then once you've possibly got something to work with, go through the usual steps you might process a vocal with  (more additive/tone-shaping tools to get a sound).\n\nThing is, if you don't have all these plugins already it would be much cheaper to just record a better vocal.

To go into some of your questions; I'm using Adam a7's (not the newer a7x's, although I tested them and they're wasn't as much of a difference as I had expected in my room). My room has been treated with diy panels, 14cm thick Rockwool and it sounds decent for a home recording studio. the dimensions aren't great and low lend monitoring isn't top of the charts but it's workable. Any peaks and valleys i did have have been sorted out further as much as possible with sonarworks which has really outdone my expectations. I also use Beyerdynamics dt770 pro's. \nUsually a lot of time does actually go into clip gaining, cleaning up and taking harshness out of vocals. I often take as much time just manually leveling a vocal, taking out esses etc as I do mixing. Fresh air and dopamine have indeed been big helpers and have been big steps towards that sizzle. Also the waves exciter in parallel has been working okay.\nI never seem to be able to get a multiband compressor to work well. Either I'm overdoing some of the setting or something because often i feel like it attenuates too much and other times to little in the places I want it to. I've noticed that a little boost in the low mids on pro-q3 that then also attenuates dynamically can work. \nCould you go into a bit more detail on what you mean with phase bringing a vocal more forward?\nI've also noticed that a lot of the sound I'm looking for comes from a certain sort of rolling kind of sound that might be coming from the rappers throat? I'm not sure at all about this but it seems like it's almost vocal fry but in a very natural way that is inherent to the singers/rappers voice. Idk if this is a rapping technique thing or if this is more accentuated in the mixing process, but it sounds really nice.\nDefinitely a big thankyou for all the tips!",

The issue we keep running in to is really terrible engineering and production caked into the vocals by this very large/random span of producer (14 total songs), then the artist says that every vocal feels over compressed (I can assure you that none of it is coming from me). I've told her time and time again that perhaps these notes would have been more effective during production or recording, but it still feels like it's my fault. (also, fun tidbit: her verbage is \"the eq on the vocal feels too compressed\"). she references the mixes on very old Apple earbuds and has the most ludacris notes about the bass n stuff. I'm mixing on PMC IB1s and Airpods, FWIW. just feels like this endless uphill battle where I'm worried I'm running thin on patience.",

SO WEIRD that this contract represents both things?? Anyways, the consensus I've come to is to pull out the calculator and figure out what my \"kill fee\" is for the amount of work I've done already, then subtract that from the flat fee I got upfront for mixing (7 out of 13 mixes are approved). The valuable lesson I've learned here is: A. the artist has to like their own music (I just don't think this is true with her...lots of insecurities). B. the artist has to like what I do (again I don't know where I'm going wrong, but she seems to think mixing can save a song). C. I have to like the music (I don't, and I haven't from the beginning). I think all 3 of these points are valuable before committing to a full album.",

A bad room can really make it painfully hard to make confident decisions that translate in the moment or even later in mixing.\n\nTemplates to me speed up your workflow not necessarily help you make better decisions if that makes sense. It\u2019s like, setting up several busses you ALWAYS make, so instead of doing 100 keystrokes and commands to get your busses and FX built, two clicks and they\u2019re there for you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what genre / style / level you\u2019re working at, but I\u2019d say just keep working at it. I love recording music because you can ALWAYS do it again. Time is the only thing you have to lose. With enough time, anything is possible. \n\nThat said, looking at a frequency analyzer of a whole mix you like isn\u2019t a horrible thing to do. Maybe you\u2019ll see your mix is way too dark, or way too thin simply.",

It\u2019s Preferable to me , to make the right sound / sample selection at source , and  put the instrumental parts in the right octaves to begin with and try to use less eq generally , not more . I\u2019m a producer who is only at the beginning stages of learning to mix properly though and understand enough that my approach will keep changing and im not mixing live tracking except for vocals . I was impressed by al Schmitts no eq mixing approach tho and like someone else said already , I\u2019ll go all pass (ssl x phase ) before HP in the lows everytime , dynamic shelves , side chain and delay ialso . Eg I often feel the dirty wu tang mixes have something the super clean super loud mixes of today lack . (Just my humble 2 pence enjoying the convo not saying I\u2019m right \u270c\ud83c\udffc) .",

When I send a signal out to a parallel compression track, compress it and then EQ, that EQ will be in parallel to the main signal. Since EQ causes fase shift this could create problems (I think?). I've noticed from doing some test and research that bell and shelve curves wouldn't really have any weird behaviors in this case, only that bell curves would have a slightly different Q and shelves would be shifted up or down in frequency ever so slightly. Filters seem to be where the real problems are, since they introduce a full 180\u00b0 phase rotation in the frequency area around the cutoff (i forgot where exactly) kinda similar to what an all pass filter would introduce but with added shift below or above the cutoff frequency depended on HP or LP. So bell and shelve curves should behave very predictably, but filters would behave in more unexpected ways. It's all kinda messy in my head because of different information sources. The internet is an amazing place but it's really hard to get good, clear and correct information sometimes.",

So if you are really struggling with a mix, it can be very helpful to try and shift things up and down an octave, while also having good communication with the producer, explaining why you are doing such moves.",

Additionally, sonarworks for your headphones is definitely worth it esp. for only 70 USD. It will smear transients a bit, but you can get over that if you reference well. Mix quiet and you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nForgot to mention, because DT 770s are closed back, making sure you have a good seal and taking breaks are critical. You need a 15 minute break for every hour you put in on cans, bare minimum IMO. Without that, attention loss and fatigue kick in. \n\nTools like tonal balance control 2 are important. I recommend setting up a Pro-MB with 3-5 bands across the entire frequency range but make them all neutral with no compression. Sub, low, mid, high mid, top end. You can monitor specific ranges now. And for sub/low end, you can turn the gain up on your headphone mix a bit, isolate the low end, and you can hear it a bit better. Make sure you turn your headphones down a bit before you un-solo the low or the sub, but this has helped me massively",

It\u2019s a curious thing , its a bit like soothe sometimes, its a bit like ...I\u2019m making v light touches that are really delicate...but when you a/b it back in the context of the mix...in some meta way it feels so different. It made me wonder if theres some phasing issues to watch out for in certain frequencies , or some tools to really keep away from. If i can best describe it, I\u2019d say it sounds a little boxy after RX ...but no frequency moves have been made, apart from sub 80hz. Ill do a reprint with no mouth de-click. Thanks again",

I found myself having to turn up the low shelf a lot to account for how bright it is.\n\nThe level rider seemed pretty good. And the compressor gets pumpy quick, but it was alright in small doses.\n\nThe doubler felt great and the two verb options sounded excellent, but I could see them being limited because they only have a dry/wet control.\n\nOverall I like that it can act as an instant-vibe plugin for when you want to move quickly through a session. It\u2019s got zero latency, which is great and seemed very light on CPU. But it\u2019s not a fit for every style. Seemingly just for big pop stuff.",

Sometimes thickening and/or darkening the drum bus (Pultec 100Hz, Studer Tape, whatever) renders this upper mid/high stuff less abrasive.\n\nSometimes addressing too much of this stuff sucks life out of drums. I leave most mad snare ringing in as I work on the drums - it often winds up being cool stuff to add to the pumping energy with heavier parallel compressors, or distortions.\n\nIs it apparent/interfering with the mix as a whole?",

Izotope insight has a very good spectrograph that clearly reveals what\u2019s happening down at 20-30 hz and how much energy is there . We ve also discussed izotope tonal balance here as well , but it\u2019s really a very handy diagnostic when used to investigate where your low end energy is against a referenced track you like . Izotope Match eq is another tool that again allows you to compare and contrast what\u2019s happening in your low end . I\u2019ve also found the Shawn Everett trick mentioned here , useful for investigating low end (put a brick wall low pass filter on your mixbus and sweep it down to the 20-30hz with your subs on and see what that actually sounds and feels like . The other thing I find helpful is my gain staging and buses are set up so that I know how much gr and level should be arriving at each bus , so you soon know if you\u2019re too hot just by looking at the comp / limiter . The last thing I\u2019d say is know your speakers . I apply all this to myself because translation is my main point of focus right now . I forget where I heard it said , but I heard it said that the listener hears the inverse of what we the mixers hear .",

Acoustic instruments may take compression, editing and some aggressive band limiting and EQ moves to make it work in the mix, but those moves tend not to work for synths in my experience. So other things need to be done like parameter automation and layering\n\nBass guitar is probably not gonna have as consistent in your face subs like 808s, but the life of it always felt more massive than 808 to me. \n\nSoft synths sound huge on their own because they have very consistent presence but when you turn the faders down for balance, it gets smaller again. So  as many mentioned it takes making it smaller to make it bigger again. I guess this also applies to distorted guitars",

Because I don\u2019t always want them to duck in the same shape or ducking is something I\u2019d do to change the nature of the tail and will still need some additional shaping to give specialness to different moments.\n\nFor vocals I like copying the audio track and make separate fx tracks because I only want it on certain words. Even for overall effect, I use a separate track so I can take out certain words from reverb or clip gain them.

But IMO you don\u2019t want to rely on the limiter as a way to achieve loudness or excitement in a mix because you\u2019ll likely end up with a crushed muddy mess\u2026 The limiter is not very good at those jobs.\n\nAlso LUFS is perceived loudness meaning EQ plays a huge role in that.. Distortion / Saturation plays a big role..  \n\nSo limiting should be one slice of the pie when it comes to achieving level\u2026 the rest should be done within the mix with the correct EQ moves . Correct distortion and some compression (not too much)",

Focus on getting the EQ targets dialed in with your mix, and the input target not clipping..  This taught me SO much about loudness.  My mixes consistently hit -9rms and -9 lufs when I get them dialed with EQ, and I no longer get the \"smushed\" feeling I used to get when trying to get loud. The mix actually breathes and is loud AF. Then when I get the eq targets dialed in, I see where I am hitting large amounts of peaks over 3-4db on the limiter, and then I address those peaks at the source in different ways. The God Particle I truly think can be a teaching tool, as well as a great sounding mix bus tool. I am now using it less and experimenting with my own chains. But seriously, this may help you as it helped me. The GP does not suck and I will always have it in the bag as sometimes it is just the right sauce.",

Tame reduces things it counts as dominant and recover adds things it thinks are being masked. Bias and brighten modulate how those things happen, but only affect the audio if tame and recover have a non zero value. The red lines on the edge of the freq display are range limiters that can be dragged to limit the processing to above the first and below the second(like a band pass) or dragged over each other to limit processing to just the high or low freq ranges.\n\nIn your screen shot you have 80% recover with a lot of heavy lifting below 200 and above 2k, that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t a ton of audio info there so gullfoss is trying to bring out whatever is there, if you range limit to where the audio is, or where you want to effect the sound gullfoss will on work on that freq range and not add a bunch of 26hz and 20k to a synth that is all midrange",

All these auxes just go through one limiter on the actual master. Of course, you don't get the effect of the proper sidechain on compression this way, but it seems like a decent compromise.",

    "content": "I think this is important to realize WHY this is working. The polarity flip is making the drums (as a whole) sum the waveforms in a more pleasing and additive way. \nThe way I theorize this is happening is because while all of the drum mics relative phase relationships remain the same, the frequencies that the drums produces slightly vary during a performance. These are NOT one shot samples going through the microphones. The 4 on the floor makes it much more complex because BOTH the snare and the kick are producing different tones (with variances) at the same time\u2026The frequencies that are additive (in-phase) are relative to all of the drum mics positioning/distance from the source, BUT different frequencies will add/subtract in magnitude\u2026that is what we are quickly checking with polarity. If you change the tuning on a snare drum for instance, it can start to become less \u201cin phase\u201d with the overheads because the fundamental frequency has changed and may not be complimentary between the OH/SN mics anymore at the same distance.",

Issue I'm having is that I'll get it dialled for one part of the song, then the key changes (it's a funk odyssey) and what was satisfying and round becomes boomy because of where I've boosted/cut in relation to fundamental/harmonics.\n\nSolution so far is to chop it up and treat each section differently, but I still don't feel like I've fully done it justice. Essentially I was hoping there'd be a EQ preset [edit - this is a joke, in case not clear] that could sort my shit out for me, but also generally interested as it's not really come across my desk before, and I know there are some funky monsters in here.\n\nGreat shouts from all though, thank you!",

It\u2019s basically a group volume ride for frequencies instead of tracks. You can also do this on individual stereo tracks if just panning isn\u2019t granular enough. \n\nThe why & when is mostly about taste. I tend to mix into a proQ3 setting that has the sides hi passed around 100 for the same reason I have a pultec boosting highs & lows on the master- it just ends up doing a lot of work for me.\n\nIt can become problematic if I\u2019ve got big toms in a song and, after I\u2019ve got a mix starting to cook I\u2019ll toggle it on & off to see if I\u2019m doing more harm than good. For the kind of music I mostly do, it works more often than not, but the one song I sent to Cian for mixing he basically blasted me for doing that. (In his own kind and gentle way.)\n\nBut m/s eq isn\u2019t just for the master buss. You can think about it for any stereo track. Sometimes, I have an acoustic that\u2019s carrying the whole song, but the fundamentals are fighting with the vocal, so I\u2019ll turn the mid down at that frequency (or side chain that to the vocal if it feels anemic when the vocal is out.) that leaves the sides as big as you like cause it\u2019s not fighting with my mono vocal.",

For instance, you are seeing a waveform that is made of the entire frequency spectrum and the amplitude will be different depending on the sound/frequency makeup of each word. When you just \"make it look even\" and play it back, many times it sounds worse than before. Full-band and multi-band compression+saturation can sound much more natural, and is wayyyy less time consuming. You are able to get a result very quickly and remain objective. \n\nClipgain is very useful...just something to be aware of!",

Attenuating a few frequency hotspots and clicks is more than half of it. Unlike Jack, I use mouth declick far more than spectral repair or declick. \n\nThere\u2019s other things I\u2019m doing as well but they vary from song to song. I\u2019ll manually smooth out plosives, mic stand bumps, clothing rustles etc. I\u2019ve even gone through and reduced the aliasing in a processed vocal (which takes fucking forever to lasso tool). \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve never seen anyone mention before is fades in RX. It\u2019s a little hard to explain so I\u2019d have to make a video for this, but I do frequency dependent fading.

I\u2019ve only been able to make parallel work on really obvious distortion on the bass \n\nthis goes for both bass guitar and 808/synth bass",

It doesn\u2019t do it elsewhere in the track and I\u2019m unsure as to why. \n\nCould this be some kind of phase cancellation? Frequency masking? I\u2019ve tried to do some sidechaining, dynamic EQ work and flipping the phase but it doesn\u2019t quite do the trick. Almost at my wits end so any pointers for further exploration appreciated!

Some of the songs sound like they were tracked with the damper pedal fully on and were also playing lightly.  The chord voicings are pretty dark and a lot of overlap in the singer's range (baritone/low tenor).  In other words I am trying to manage a ton of soupy low mids.\n\nLong story short - any go to things you try for treatment in this type of situation?  Heavy handed EQ left the piano feeling pretty unnatural - soothe2 is the closest thing so far to working well but also wondering if there's anything else I can try.",

    "content": "Great, we\u2019ve all kind of known that. Back to FFT, which works in a LINEAR  way. If we run a 16 \u201cband\u201d FFT on a 48 kHz signal it will divide the audio spectrum (0 Hz to 24 kHz) into 16 evenly spaced bins or bands. Each bin is 1500 Hz wide. Think about that for a second. That means we have a a single bin that contains everything from 16500 to 18000 Hz, a very \u201cnarrow\u201d slice as it pertains to musical interest. On the flip side we are left with only a single bin that represents everything from 0 Hz to 1500 Hz, a huge chunk of the music. If the whole point was to slice up this signal so we could do something interesting to it then that is often not the resolution we hoped for. \n\nI see the hands going up!! \u201cLet\u2019s just increase the number of bands to get more frequency resolution\u201d. And herein lies one of the confounding things about FFT. We are caught in a frequency domain/time domain tradeoff. The finer the bands or slices the more things blur in the time domain when we reconstitute via the iFFT (of the bands we have processed any or all bands). If no processing then you can run any length FFT and then the iFFT and perfectly reconstruct the original signal. (This is what you\u2019ll often see 16 to 48k FFT on signal meters).\n\nSo some practical examples to help you guys get a handle on this. Open a file in RX and get the spectral repair module in attenuate mode set to a strength of 1. Set bands to the lowest possible (128?), figure out how wide your bins are. Now try to do a detailed edit in the low end, you\u2019ll notice that you don\u2019t have much \u201cresolution\u201d, but up high say above 10k it\u2019s razor sharp. Now bump up your bands to the max 4096. Do the same LF edit and you\u2019ll suddenly have nice narrow frequency slices but you\u2019ll see things getting very blurry in the time domain, tight kicks become smeary whooshes",

    "content": "Yeah. Less and less these days. A full mix might only have 2-3 effects sends on it. I've moved to a workflow where each channel (or group of instruments) get their own \"send effects\" right on the channel.\n\nThis is partly because a lot of the tools I use now include EQ and dynamics processing that allow me to sculpt within the plugin, and it's is partly because Ableton's rack tools enable me to easily set up parallel processing for effects within the channel without the need to mult-out or send the instrument to separate channels. It's way more efficient and easy to manage my sessions now.",

That\u2019s fine if you want it to sound unison. But if the goal is clarity and separation then you need to find a place where one isn\u2019t in the way of the other. I like to think of this as guiding the ear. Example: I\u2019d like to hear the vocal close but I want to feel longer.  In this instance I\u2019d use pre delay in the reverb and darken the reverb  to achieve this.",

Im using parrallels of my kick and bass to get my loudness and harmonics, pre Low End Bus . If id want more control id consider a hz-dependent side chain on the bass from the kick, but dont like how that f's with the attack of the bass. Trying to do less processing at all stages......and get there with better balancing ..... So...a tiny bit of  comp on the kick and bass buses (0.5 db slow attack, fast release...usually neutron comp) and only an eq and standard clip on the kick bass bus to only catch random peaks and not jam the final  limiter . i like a littler expansion also , playing around with the pro G expnasion mode is fun",

Beyond reps and intuition, are there things that have helped you hone in on this? And are you consciously adjusting your \u201cthreshold\u201d based on the music or genre you\u2019re working with or do you have a general taste for how you like to hear things regardless of the style and use other tools to get the character and vibe you\u2019re going for.\n\nIn other words, do you think about how far you go with these tools as a creative and stylistic decision or more of a functional one?",

    "content": "I can't speak to the mixing aspect of it (I only master), but a few points I've found helpful:\n\nI use notion, but any type of board thing would be fine -- colums for \"confirmed/files here\", \"sent\", \"revisions needed\", \"alts needed\" (after approval usually), etc etc have helped. Trello or Notion allows you to keep any notes in the actual card itself, which may be helpful with management or more people involved. I have a separate Notion board for potential projects until files are in, then they go in the \"actual\" project tracker.\n\nFor the multiple messaging fronts...I use texts.com. All messaging apps in one place (email included, though you can't reply there) in an iMessage like format. I know @Nomograph Mastering has concerns about anything like that in regards to security, but I've looked into it and it seems very secure for where I'm at (anything sensitive I am password protecting files, etc as well).\n\nAs far as revisions, I'm sure most of us try to keep it as timely as possible. Normally I try to do it ASAP, same day or next day latest. And as you know, when you are busy revisions are a very real thing to consider, especially if your number of projects is high. I do revisions very fast -- take the note, implement it, send. For instance just yesterday was sailing along...BOOM. Revision from something two months ago. If you're working on hundred+ projects a month that's just the norm, even if 90 percent get approved first pass. Gotta be able to roll on that very fast, people really appreciate it (I know you know this, saying for others here too). Which requires good tracking, session management, etc etc.\n\nThe real trick is handing the very difficult revision processes where people go down rabbit holes, doing whatever is required for the result there but not letting it destroy the schedule. It can be tough.\n\nAll that said, I definitely have pain points I'm working on (being slow invoicing as one, sometimes there just aren't enough hours in the day)",

    "content": "Hello guys! I'm mixing a Trap hiphop song that i've produced. At the moment, i'm exporting the stems for a mastering engineer and a question comes up to my mind: As i playback when mixing, i'm listening to my 65 tracks all going through the mixbuss (Slate MixBus - Maag MagnumK - Bx_digital - SPL IRON - ProQ3). So the sound i'm hearing is the outcome of all the tracks being processed by this chain, and especially, compressed by the IRON compressor. So If i bounce every single track/stem individually, will they be compressed? When printinting the stems like this they would hit the bus compressor or not? Any ideas?? Thanks in advance ^^",

When mixing ITB though I tend to think more about it and it kind of breaks the flow. Now I\u2019m curious how you guys approach it.

Other than that, I haven't found compression very helpful. I'm always hearing of people going crazy with it and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out?? - Especially with drums?? I can see what it's doing when I apply it - to the drums - but I just don't find that I ever produce a very helpful or flattering result... And golly - A little while back I was working on one of my songs with a mixer whom I hold in VERY high regard. He was guiding me through my mix with his methods - Basically using parallel compression on everything, and I remember distinctly feeling several times as though my \"hands were tied\" - The session felt very \"stiff\" with all that going on.

Recently have been using it for back-bus compression, a technique I heard Andrew Scheps talk about which is basically a copy of the mixbus minus drums. Mix bus stays uncompressed or less compressed. Back bus gets compressed more aggressively than I would do a mix bus. Blend that under the mix bus to taste. Really good for locking all the instrumentation together around vocals without dynamics getting pulled around by the drums. I think Andrew uses some kind of 1176 but the idea works with all kinds of compressors.\n\nMix bus and backbus both feed into a 2-bus where more processing may happen. Something like Pultec EQP1q, tape emultion, Pro L2? But I like to change things up!",

    "content": "I\u2019m struggling with some vocals that have a sort of \u201cgrain\u201d or distortion in the top end.  Something around the 6-7k region but it extends across most of the top end.  I didn\u2019t notice it really when tracking. It\u2019s paired with a very low mid heavy vocal so it\u2019s making adding high end and clarity difficult. I blamed my chain for days but when I opened another vocal done through the exact same chain the following day from another artist it was like butter so it\u2019s obviously inherent to the vocal which makes sense in hindsight.  \n\nAny ideas on how to bring out some more clarity in the top end and not exaggerate that? I\u2019ve tried sooth, had a brief look at declicking in rx, spectre. What\u2019s worked the best so far has been using Accentize spectral balancer to clamp the top end and then clariphonic to bring it back up and that has helped. \n\nIt\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019d imagine rx to reduce the noisy component in that frequency range would help but your air is essentially a noisy component. \n\nAnyone ever came across this grain? \n\nThe style of music doesn\u2019t demand crazy top end so I could just embrace the warmth but I\u2019d love a bit more articulation. \n\nSorry for the long post",

Every extra minute spent on trying to iron it all out there will save you hours in editing and mixing. I\u2019ve often considered selling a piece of gear and then had a really stellar vocal go through only to realise there was nothing wrong with the gear. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of reading it but the performance is everything. You can\u2019t REALLY EQ air and body into a vocal that isn\u2019t there. You can\u2019t try simulate it alright. And you can\u2019t create actual excitement with compression, just try and trick the brain into thinking there\u2019s excitement. A 57 into any preamp into any interface with a stellar performance will sound amazing. \n\nAfter that is just treatment, and it\u2019s essentially pointless discussing chains because it\u2019s so song and vision dependant. \n\nA boring answer I know but you\u2019ll save a lot of headache and heart ache the sooner you learn it. \n\nIt\u2019s like when you hear a new compressor plugin just explode a drum room and it sounds amazing. Analogue glue, explosive release, so much groove. And then you slap it on the lacklustre room and performance you actually have in front of you and it doesn\u2019t seem to sound so amazing any more.",

    "content": "Yeah, love soothe, using it to control  the low mid resonances on this thus far. Maybe I could dig in a bit harder for the highs with it. Bloom didn\u2019t work, it made it sound a bit more plastic-y and actually made the grainyness more pronounced. I haven\u2019t gotten good results with bloom on female vocals so far, but I know that one day it will be just the thing needed. I think that probably RX will yield the best results, but for some reason I find myself resisting digging in with RX on this, probably because I know it\u2019s going to be hard work and I\u2019m a little lazy. Good lazy, though, because if I\u2019m not I try too hard and end up taking away what\u2019s good. \n\nI don\u2019t have Ozone, but maybe this is what will push me over the edge to try it, hmmm. \n\nI was thinking that maybe some sort of tape thing could work, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work with Tupe inmediately and the UAD Ampex made it brighter and more distorted. It kind of feels like it\u2019s already on the edge of breaking up too much and becoming unpleasant, a bit like being touched softly on the arm when you have a fever and it\u2019s almost painful. Hmm, now I\u2019m just blabbering on. I\u2019ll stop for now. Thank you for your suggestion!",

I'm the type to bite off more than I can chew, but I usually don't mind the consequences of that. I actually have another song from a different artist that is much better, maybe I'll start with that. To be fair my question was very open ended since in reality I'm also just wondering how to approach a vocal chain and vocal production beyond simply copying a preset or blindly adjusting settings on various plug ins. Something like an eq, or even other things like saturation or simple sidechain on a reverb is simple enough to somewhat understand, but the culmination of various settings and layered effects does start to get complicated and a bit unintuitive.\n\nI think fundamentally I need more attempts and practice struggling on my own, but I also think it's helpful to see if at some point I can find a bit of guidance or collaboration to accelerate my learning and focus my vision and efforts more efficiently. I appreciate your response and will try to not overthink it and focus mainly on leveling the bars to taste and moving on to practice some tuning on the vocal after. Thanks again !",

So yeah I\u2019d first try pumping low end into it, be it with EQ or subharmonic, followed by some (a lot) of compression. I\u2019m sure better people here have a better way to do this. \n\nThe DI itself doesn\u2019t have any overtones other than stuff you\u2019re finding unflattering, so you could try mult\u2019ing the DI signal out to an amp sim (even some guitar amps work here) to fill out the spectrum that the guitars aren\u2019t fulfilling \n\nI\u2019d also say the bass drum could use some augmenting of the low end  and maybe a bit of length in order to emphasise that impact. Because the synth bass atm has all the power, and isn\u2019t omnipresent, so it\u2019s leaving the rest of the arrangement even _more_ neutered as a result",

As I said, a lot is about simple volume shaping, but that doesn\u2019t always give me what I\u2019m after. For example, how that octave layer trick translates to kicks. If I have a kick that I want to feel snappier on top, could I duplicate it and pitch it up an octave, or would that mess with the mid/low end? Or is it more about lifting the top with EQ to bring the transient forward? That always feels a bit strange when it\u2019s pushed too hard, so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right approach either. Just curious how pro mix engineers handle it.",

It's really a useful plugin and I use it a lot, especially for more kind of hi fi-y jazz stuff.",

Usually I\u2019m low passing with ISOL8 to listen for limiting/clipping clicks. These artifacts are unable to be heard unless I have a low pass filter active but I theorize that they, along with the extreme compression subconsciously degrade the listening experience by discretely assaulting your ears to the point of needing to take a break from listening. \n\nMy music can be related sonically to clara la sans \u201canother night\u201d give or take more or less busy. (Keep in mind her stuff is cranked to the point of audible artifacts sitting around -7ish lufs integrated across the chorus).\n\nI arrange the mix well and leave 1db of headroom for summing on individual instruments whilst they are loud enough for my target of -10 LUFi across the chorus, meaning my mix is actually 1db louder than -10 with space to sum on the pre master bus. Leaving headroom means I can introduce less artifacts at the cost of having to squeeze the dynamic range of individual instruments more than otherwise.\n\nMy issue is that If I want to aim for let\u2019s say -8LUFSi across the chorus in a relatively clean way with minimal artifacts, I\u2019m forced to squeeze the mix to -7.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear y\u2019all thoughts on whether or not technically inaudible artifacts/distortion matter and whether or not it\u2019s really worth for me to squeeze my mix 2db more in the name of competitive loudness?\n\nPs. Please bear with me as I am trying to figure this all out solo. Feel free to criticize my approach.",
