    "content": "Man. I am loving the De-emphasis section on Tupe. It lets you squeeze so much saturation out of a signal without driving things too hard. \n\nFirst, you drive your signal to the point where the loudest part starts to break up, then you use the de-emphasis to subtract that frequency from the saturation circuit and then you push the gain up even harder until you're on the edge of breakup again. Wash, rinse, repeat. \n\nWhat you end up with is a signal that's evenly saturated across the entire frequency range instead of only having the loudest parts treated, because they're all hitting the saturation at roughly the same level. This thing is amazing. It's the sound that I've been searching for for soooo long.",

Yours sounds huge.\u201d\n\n\nBasically what I did, besides level & panning, was carve out a bunch of like 400 in all harmonic elements. All the tracks sounded good, but the density was all bunched up down in that range. \n\nAs I was explaining it to him, I had a moment of clarity about headroom. Doesn\u2019t matter if all frequencies are present for a big and tall mix, if all the headroom is getting eaten up by everything hitting the same frequencies, the collective volume of that is gonna make everything else feel quieter. \n\nI usually think of headroom in regard to low end and transients, but it\u2019s true for every part of a mix.",

    "content": "@BoozleBAM This is a GREAT question, and having read the whole convo twice I don't think it was really answered. Honestly I probably won't be able to answer it either, but here are some thoughts in no particular order\n\nFirst the usual caveat, I'm not a mixer and I haven't mixed a record in a decade. But I did record and mix for 20 years before that and followed the whole arc from beginner not understanding compression, to pro finding my way and getting to own or use all of the baller dream hardware. All that to say I have a lot of empathy for where you are at with it. These are not definitive statements, just aspects to think about..\n\n1) First something of a hot take that I don't see represented online. IMO compression often makes an individual instrument sound \"worse\". If you play and record something like drums well or acoustic guitar well, a compressed version will often sound *less real* and less vital. So why in the world would we do it???\n\n- The first reason is that we mostly don't care about how individual instruments sound, we care about the whole song. Often a compressed sound will play nicer in an arrangement than something dynamic, real and recorded in a \"documentarian\" way\n\n- The second reason is a trade off that isn't often spoken about. Compressed instruments often translate better into the wild. Take a beautiful, dynamic, real sounding, hifi & documentarian recording of say upright bass, drums and acoustic guitar. Listen in your studio in great monitors and it's a dream. Now go to Target and play it in mono on the overhead speaker on a busy saturday.....it just won't survive ... the song gets lost. Or drive with your window open, or cook dinner with the AC on etc etc.",

Eric came from tape and he was always cranking the high end on the record side going to tape to account for noise on mix down (easier to tame low end than it is to boost when you're mixing off of tape)... but there was a cool high end sheen that you'd get. So with Saturn, you just separate a high frequency band above what is really audible and just crank the gain on the warm tape setting. Obviously you can adjust to taste, but it's a great way to add a little air & excitement to some dull recordings.",

    "content": "Mind if I ramble? I'm working on what is probably the most challenging mix I've done this year. I've been at my first pass for close to 2 weeks, and have probably started it over 4 times. For context, it's a very dense country rock song with like 80-90 tracks, heavy heavy buss processing, many layers hitting exceptional stages of compression and saturation. The most challenging part is that, despite my philosophical differences from the producer's template, the rough mix really works. Anytime I try to strip it back, import my template, do my own thing, make the mix fit into my \"mixing philosophy\", it just falls apart. I've considered stemming it out with Bounce Factory through his template to then put the tracks into my template, but that would be a zero sum game I can already expect to lose. \n\nUltimately I've had to shift my perspective of wondering \"why am I here?\" I'm learning that my role is not to run this song through some proprietary process I take pride in, but to simply just help them reach the finish line by trying to understand and continue within the process they've already deeply baked this song through. I've found that I can apply my perspective while setting my \"process\" aside, and explore what small tweaks or decisions I *can* make that get us the last couple % we might be missing. Any previous approach I've tried I already know would result in a 10+ revision nightmare trying to get back to the original magic of the rough.\n\nAnd on the interpersonal front, I've decided against sharing any of this struggle with the artist. Maybe the mix that gets approved of the 4 that I've done is the one I spent 30 minutes on, but the many hours of me feeling like I'm \"failing\" on the other 3 passes were needed to understand that this track only needed 30 minutes of my time. Excuses don't get us to the finish line. \n\nWhat has been your experience in these situations?",

Inspiration is a slave driver. \n\nThis held true over into the recording world for me as well. When I was trying to capture something in my head I was a slave to it, but when I\u2019m trying to capture something in someone else\u2019s head, I\u2019m merely curious and experimental.

    "content": "Any of you all ever used the Gaffel Synced Band Splitter? I was treated to a bit of a real life MWTM with Chris Coady last night (super kind guy) and he was showing me this plugin to mix a big pop vocal sound. He duplicated the lead vocal twice to have three tracks and had this plugin as the first insert on each track, split into three bands for each channel, low vocal, mid vocal, high end vocal. The plugin auto syncs the band settings in all instances whenever you adjust a band. He was saying Serban uses this plugin and does that exact thing on some songs. After treating each track with some eq/comp/saturation the vocal sounded really big but balanced. And it\u2019s like $60 so I think I\u2019m going to have to grab it. Probably could do this with other plugins but I appreciated the auto-syncing function and also didn\u2019t notice any weird phase issues which you could maybe run into trying to create the bands by hand?",

Big pillars for me were connecting arrangement to mixing, glue vs contrast, LCR awareness, front to back awareness\u2026 dynamic range, harmonics vs fundamental\u2026 how shit really makes you feel\u2026stuff like that. The basics are always being applied..  Another big one is the balance of when you need to get the fuck out of the way of the music and when you need to roll up the sleeves and insert some vibe.. after that comes technique, then gear.",

    "content": "theres so many ways to interpret this question. so here's my take. Mixing to me at least, is all about bringing out the intent of the record to the best of your abilities. Fx. if you are mixing a Classical record, all you aim for is probably getting something as close to being in the room as possible, and therefore fidelity. If you are mixing some new urban underground cultural music, you want to respect the grittiness as that can sometimes be part of the sound and/or culture, and you never want to remove the inherent DNA of what makes that thing exciting(even tho it might be unconventional). So in the end, it's OUR job to make the decisions on when to be rough and when to be high fidelity. It's all about what you want out of the music. For most mainstream music(aka. radio oriented) i would personally get a bit of both. Get the mix sounding somewhat exciting as to pull in the listener, but also have certain aspects be high fidelity as to make it easy to listen to. FX, in a pop record, Vocal intelligibility is super important if you want people to sing along, where are in a techno track or hyperpop track you can have some grittier vocals, as they aren't as intended to be the in the car sing along song. They would be much more about the energy and feeling. \n\nIMO theres nothing more boring than a perfect mix, where every sound is perfectly inline and has no personality that makes it memorable. \n\nThe creativity of a mix is just as, if not more important, than the technicals. Thats what those cyborgs called Mastering Engineers are for.",

It's achievable both ways.\n\nBut since you're having trouble getting your verbs to pop out in the way you want, here are a few things that will get you there. Usually a combination of these things:\n\n**1.** Turn up the verb - Simple, I know.\n**2.** Make space for the verb - Mute or EQ competing elements.\n**3.** Increase your pre-delay time to the range of 60ms - 150 ms. This \"disconnects\" your verb from the source and makes it stand out more. And this sometimes means you can turn it down and still have the clarity. \n**4.** Use an echo instead of a verb - This sometimes does the thing and takes up less space.\n**5.** Use a slap echo instead of a verb - One and done. Gives you that room-y feel without taking up a lot of space.\n**6.** EQ muddy/thick/harsh frequencies out of your verb, so that you can turn it up louder without overwhelming the mix.\n**7.** Gently apply an effect (distortion, phaser, etc) that will make it contrast and catch the ear easier.",

He uses peak limiters and clippers everywhere, so nothing has a chance of peaking out from where he placed it. That\u2019s in effect trimming all the Attack of an instrument but not really messing with the decay sustain or release because with a peak limiter it\u2019s acting so fast that you can use it to manipulate a sound without it drastically changing the other aspects of it ADSR in synth world works the same in all audio. A clipper does the manipulation for \u201csaturation\u201d to get the desired grit that we might have gotten in yesteryear from things like tubes tape and transformers.\n\nI think that it\u2019s likely a smart fast and easy way to get a result like JC is looking for where it\u2019s loud and sounds open still. Because you can\u2019t really hear the peak limiting like you can hear a compressor doing 4:1 compression. Also know JC has a 1k \u201chandicap\u201d as he calls it on his mix bus, pulling out a few db and he is using the spectral shaper from 1-6k to tame harshness on the mix bus. (Don\u2019t do this just because he does) These are things he\u2019s added because it helps him get to his desired result faster, and when you mix one or two songs a day everyday for years you\u2019re going to develop \u201ctricks\u201d or \u201chandicaps\u201d or whatever you want to call them to help you get to your desired result.\n\nLearn everything you can about mixing if that\u2019s what you want to do, and use only the things you try that YOU like, not because someone else makes work you like, your mileage may vary",

    "content": "this is answer might not be the most exciting.\n\nActual Separation does not come from EQ, Compression and Saturation. These are just tool to help manipulate a sound into how you want it to sound. \n\nSeparation comes from Arrangement. If you have a Piano and a Guitar playing full chords in the same octave, you'll never get good sounding separation, no matter how much you try and manipulate the sound.\nSounds are made from a fundamental and certain overtones/harmonics. If they overlap, then they overlap, even if you add a random eq boost on each sound some Freqs apart, because someone on youtube did that. (not that you can't do it, and it wont work)\nBut Instead of removing good sounding parts of a sound forcing them to fit together(whatever that even means at this point), arrange the parts so they naturally fit together with separation. This way you'll be able to act more, creatively and instinctively on how you want the sounds to sound while mixing, instead of fitting a triangle into a circle. As the good old saying says, it starts at the source, for the best results. \n\nFx, in a typical jazz band, often a Bass will play roots on 1 & 3,  a piano will of then play the root and 5th an octave above that, and a guitar could play the 3rd and 7th, and together all the instruments make big full chords while also having their own space. this way there is now plenty of room for a singer or a Sax player to do its thing and not worry to much about cutting through a dense mix.",

We sat and I asked him basically if I\u2019m trying to hear something in the drums that isn\u2019t there (we discussed the tracking and how he played ) . He explained that he was playing totally to the OH mics and the kick was not the point but was only a supporting role (like a jazz performance ) . He jokingly told me off that it \u201cwasn\u2019t fucking hip hop \u201c, \u201cwith a kick and snare and some shit sprinkled on top \u201c. We were both in stitches (laughing ) at this point . So we co mixed the drum sound with almost nothing but the overheads and it sounded fuckin amazing . Mind blown . I love this game . I called someone in to spank my mix and became instantly better . Ego death = growth . Can\u2019t wait for the world to hear these mixes too .Ps . I would love to hear flood discuss his work . I think he did the Joshua tree right ?  I\u2019ve been listening a lot to that record lately for inspiration",

Certain meters move faster than others, not all 10ms attack times will actually attack the same, certain GUIs that imply some sort of analog modeling may not actually do so, etc. Just listen and trust your ears.\n\n2. If you can't hear certain aspects right away, that's fine too. You can't force it, don't rush it. Still just listen and trust your ears.\n\n3.

I guess what I meant to say is that through the dozens of interviews with Jon and Matt, it's clear that he's averse to using compressors and tends to use saturators more to do the job. While I fuckin' LOVE me some saturators, I honestly don't see the two as interchangeable... they're just two very different tools. One is leveling volume and the other is distorting a waveform to generate harmonics. I think saturators are a great next level tool for people who have wrapped their brains around compression.... but you really need some form of compression on an un-treated vocal. I feel in contemporary music, people are leaning too much on high-end saturation to get things to sound exciting and hyped. If I'm ever using saturators to distort things (which is often), I'm always trying to find some sort of un-distorted high end source to help the ears cling to clarity in the mix. Sometimes, things will distort in a way that will add this clarity -- or even manufacture it. But most of these multi-band saturators are just adding a layer of fuzz to the entire midrange up and the whole mix just ends up sounding hazy. IMO, a great example of modern hip-hop mixing is Mac Miller's Circles. The high end on that record sounds just as exciting as anything else, but it doesn't sound like everything got ran through a buzz saw (shoutout Greg Koller/Jon Brion). Just my 0.02.",

You could try is slightly different EQ curves for each side, compressing each side independently, even a subtle flanger on each side can be cool, or maybe different styles of saturation. The options are pretty endless. I believe @oaklandmatt has mentioned in an episode that he'll pitch one double up a few cents and the other down a few cents to give a wider image.",

In theory, this emphasizes what @Zack Hames and others said\u2014good choruses shines because of contrast. Often times, if you have a build up to a chorus or a transition into it, I like to look at the \u201ceasy to undercook\u201d elements like risers/rev reverbs, beat cuts, and harmonic layers/white noise to ensure there\u2019s that layer of \u201cooo,\u201d \u201caaa,\u201d and \u201cwow\u201d. Good rev verbs/risers shouldn\u2019t just be random white noise, I find a lot of success in tuning them and then automating the tuning so the pitch rises as well. Play with that. A great beat cut on the last count before a chorus is a killer idea. Try cutting the melodic elements and leaving the bass, maybe cutting everything\u2014listen to some Neptunes era stuff for inspo, or just more Neptunes in general honestly for pop music references.",

As the release lets go and brings up the room gain you get this urgent and explosive energy. When the room is good, and the compression timing is set right it can really make things sound bigger than real life. Remember we're trying to tell a story here, we can't jam the *actual* real power and size of stadium rock drums into that mono speaker at Target but listen to Paradise City and it tells the story pretty well ... our brain does an amazing job of filling in the rest\n\n- The last example is using something like a good tube compressor on vocals. With a nice soft knee and lots of gain reduction we get bring up a bunch of low level and emotional detail, breathy whispery stuff at the end of lines etc that can really help a lyric connect. Often with something like a good tube compressor we get a healthy amount of harmonic distortion too along for the ride which adds weight to the vocal and draws the listeners attention",

Wanting this to be a hybrid of the two sounds, not a live show and not a spotify release but somewhere in the middle, so I premixed the snare/kick/tom samples and triggered them in. My favorite element for this is that I can work with the overheads in addition to the close mics and sculpt those to fit each drum. For example, the toms I'm blasting the overhead with tape saturation that is giving them a nice airy attack. then when I trigger them in, I'm essentially getting that tone from the overheads without applying that processing to the entire overhead mix (which has loads of cymbals). If most of my snare tone was coming from just close mics, I wouldn't care as much about triggering it would just be more for a consistent sound. but since I can sculpt the overheads so distinctly for each drum, it's making a much bigger impact on the mix to use these samples. additionally, i'm triggering in the kick and snare from the original track, which are kind of pop/electronic sounding, and just blending them in enough to get the attitude of the studio version.\"*",

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

Tbh I use higher octave stuff to help narrative development so usually the higher stuff is intentional. But if you\u2019re in a chorus and this is happening in spaces it shouldn\u2019t be, than I\u2019m with Cian- compressions & parallel distortion should go a long way to evening it out. BUT, there\u2019s a bunch of great subsynth plugs out there too, and for more modern stuff it\u2019s really useful to use them especially on electric bass. No new info here, just confirming what everyone else is saying.",

That\u2019s probably me jus being superstitious on the last one . Logic time delay compensation isn\u2019t where I\u2019d want it to be personally (even paralleling is a bit dicey sometimes ) .

Starting with the biggest section of the song helps as well. I can then automate the other sections up or down *including the master fader feeding the 2bus*  As far as clipping/limiting on sources/busses I find it good to shape the sounds how I want (more heavy lifting) then the busses/2bus end up just glueing it together with a lighter touch. I think the 2bus doing too much of the lifting is where it can start to fall apart.",

Then i will mess w the EQ settings of the delay signal to give it the right freq content. I personally only use the ping pong and stereo modes (never really use the M/S). \n\nThen in the third tab i set up the ducking  and mess with the threshold and release settings to duck out of the way of the lead. I love the sound of the echo swelling up after the phrase is done so i'll usually start at -15 for theshold and ~100ms for release and experiment from there. that third tab also has noise, gate, and a wobble option to add some more character. Then just like the diffusion setting in valhalladelay - you can use the reverb and decay settings to add verb to the delay signal pre/on feedback/post in the chain to give it more softness/space. \n\nBut the killer feature is then you can modulate these settings in the 2nd tab... then i add a little percentage change to one side of the ping pong delay ~1.3% so it's not completely locked in and just adjust settings from there. on the first page, you can also drive the input super hard to get a distorted sound and bring down the output level (like a preamp). It's super versatile and you can get big swelling verb echoes or overdrive space echo type sounds.",

Its goal is to make the overall artifacts of limiting more pleasing\n2) I find it faster, more versatile, and better for limiting than a Vari-Mu emulation. Not to mention the UI is way more helpful than what I'm used to with a plugin looking to remind us of a Fairchild or similar\n3) Yes, it just doesn't brickwall, and it has a vibe\n4) You don't Need Tupe if you have a saturator you already like, but I adore it.

Again, Goodhertz's UI makes it more versatile than any other Tube and/or Tape emulator I've seen. It has a million options to tailor the saturation. The Opto Compressor and simple EQ are fast and versatile. It sounds good",

Beyond that my main thought is that I don\u2019t want to hear the microphone. ie. mechanical sounding capsule buzz is something I tend to attenuate. \n\nAll of this happens without me being able to hear the instrumental context (though I wish I could. RX integration into a daw context would be a game changer for me). \n\nRuairi will rebalance the harmonics in a vowel, and while I also do that some in a vocal prep context, it\u2019s harder because the undulation of resonances in a full musical context sometimes feels exciting while in solo it sounds off-putting. Ruairi gets to have the whole song in his RX window where I\u2019m often only hearing the vocal, so I have to be a little more careful to imagine context and hedge my bets Hippocratic oath style, lest it looses some life.",

I have noticed that many of my favorite mixes are, in fact, IMPERFECT! There are things I notice about them all the time that I, myself, as a preeminent mixer to be, would change: SOmetimes they're too compressed, sometimes they're a little harsh, sometimes I can't really hear the snare, sometimes the snare sounds like a tyco toy... I just found it interesting that all these mixes that I've idoloized and resonated with for so long had things that, to me, were glaringly imperfect... Back to my 3-day old wine. Thanks, guys!",

Starting with the vocal is actually a very pertinent point for me . \nFor this body of work I\u2019m going  through currently the vocals are all tracked to a 2track instrumental but  with most of the songs  I\u2019m importing all the instrumental multitracks  into a new alternative of the mix and ditching the stereo instrumental , much for the reason you\u2019ve pointed to there . \nThe balance of the instrumental sounds excellent to itself but once you start mixing the vocals , they really need a re balance of the instrumental mix elements to allow space . So this has had me listening to the vocal alone first at length and then bringing back the instrumental elements very much around it. I was thinking yesterday how remarkably different a balance was needed to give the vocal its place.  It feels like trying to matchmake two friends who are going to be great together if you can just find the right setup , \nMain weapons (of love ) have been faders , panning and gentle eq . All of which I learnt how to harness their true power here . I\u2019m back at it again this morning and feel great about the challenge again and do love these songs . The artists are telling true stories and speaking their truth in them and that\u2019s what drives me to excel with a project \n\n\nThere\u2019s also an addictive joy and fear dynamic here atm as I continue my ever deepening realisation that there is no perfect mix to find and attach myself to ! \n\nI have to remain open for the \u201cfeeling \u201c right ? Ha ha . This is Some mystical stuff we engage ourselves in I swear \n\nThanks Ruari , best wishes",

I've recorded not-so-great rappers through nice chains and mixing wasn't the answer to save a (lacking) source. It never gave you *that* feeling. But even if you are recording great rappers cheaper mics tend to lack body and rarely have \"boostable\" or pleasant top end as you said. So it's a bit complicated before you even get to \"mixing\". Felt that was important to mention so you're not too hard on yourself.\n\nBut assuming that the limiting factor really is just mixing there's a bunch of options. First things first: is your monitoring and listening environment decent? Or are you on headphones? This could make placing vocals even harder for you. \n\nThen do you have a process that starts with vocal cleanup to get rid of or reduce unappealing harshness or performance issues? Despite being simple, people tend to skip basic tools like clip-gain to even out a performance. This should usually also give you some leeway for strategic boosts. Maybe instead of EQ look at harmonics. Fresh Air by Slate is free. Gem Dopamine is nice. Spectre is great. All of these should give you that \"sizzle\" you might be missing.\n\nThen to get the presence and even out the performance you could try some parallel compression with something like an 1176. Also, try out Multiband Compression with the Mcdsp 404 or C6 or whatever you have to control the performance throughout the song once you've got a vocal sound you like.\n\nI also find mixing the 808 & drums together with the vocal the most useful when it comes to gain staging and getting the song to feel right.\n\nObviously, there's more that could be said but I find processes more helpful than tools. It's art at the end of the day. Attached what Serban's assistant sees as their/his \"mixing process\". Mix more and experiment with what you have. Get feedback from the artists.",

Another thing I'd try if you have it is soothe2 if you can get it to mostly work on that resonance without killing the tone (even maybe these both in combination) and then finally I'd try something like Saturn or Kclip in multiband and try and use a combination of dynamics and saturation within that band to tame it further.  If it's really bad maybe a combination of those 3, or just automating an EQ but that sounds grueling and time consuming if it's throughout the entire performance.  Maybe Surfer EQ could also accomplish this but I don't have that plug.  I also think there's a Surfer EQ type function in Nectar or Neutron?  Somebody that knows Izotope's stuff better than me can probably chime in.\n\nMy 2 cents and probably there are some better solutions out there but this is where I'd start personally!",

Taken from the fabfilter Pro L manual \n\u201cLookahead\nThe Lookahead knob sets the look-ahead time for the initial 'transient' stage. This allows the limiter to examine the incoming audio in advance and predict the amount of gain reduction needed to meet the requested output level. If the look-ahead time is very short, the limiter doesn't have much time to move to the desired level: this will generally have the effect of preserving transients better and increasing the apparent loudness, but at the expense of possible distortion. Longer look-ahead times are safer, but less loud, and transients might appear to get lost in the mix a little more.\u201d",

The worst offenders usually have their larynx touching their hyoid bone when they sing and have a fuckload of muscular tensions that cause harmonics that resonate at the frequency of the tension of the muscle. Think of it like changing the tension point on a guitar string by placing your finger on a fret to change the pitch, but at arbitrary points set by how tense your muscles are, and each muscle in your neck and face is acting as a mini speaker driver pushing out these random ass harmonics rather than a nice harmonic structure built off of the fundamental.

I love the way MAAT Santa Cruz does this ever so smoothly. \n2. I compress the bass with a compressor sidechained to a LPF(!), to get some low end body which is usually severely lacking. The LPF is set between 1000-2000 hz, attack 0-8 ms and release 200-400 ms depending on the tempo of the song/bass part. Reducing 3-5 dB on peaks. This gets me really far.\n3. If the bass is a shortscale, I\u2019ll use Goodhertz Tiltshift to move the low mids from around 200 hz to around 100 hz, out of the way of the guitars. \n4. Then I put an amp emulation on the channel. Whichever one floats your boat. Plugin Alliance B15, Guitar Rig, TSE BOD, whatever. I\u2019ll be boosting low end and cutting high end here, or before with a separate instance of Tiltshift. \n5. If I want the bass to sound \u201erock\u201c and cut, I send it to a parallel distortion, which can be anything. I like TSE BOD, which is another sansamp copy which  has a lot of sub.

Even with \u201cinclude return and master effects\u201d checked in the export settings in Live, your tracks won\u2019t 1:1 with dynamics processing or non linear processing (saturation) without using external side-chain routing.\n\nI\u2019d have a discussion with your mixer about if they\u2019d like you to remove your mix bus or if they\u2019d like it baked into each track/stem you are printing.  If it\u2019s the latter, you can create sidechain source tracks to feed plugins that allow for an external sidechain input to keep it closer to 1:1 (still likely not fully accurate with the nonlinearities in some analog modeled plugins).\n\nThis is a pretty tough thing to type out but if we can find a few minutes today where our time overlaps I\u2019m down to hop on a VC and show my workaround for this situation in Ableton.",

We\u2019re still on this learning journey so happy for any pushback or insight\n\nFor the most part, our group felt the tradeoffs of very subtle multiband often outweigh the benefits, since just putting those crossovers in the signal makes a bigger difference than, say, a dB of control.\n\nWe felt more liberal use of multiband can add an aggression and excitement that is very familiar and unique, and prefer treating it as a sweetener or energizer over the whole mix more than trying to control problem areas that could be addressed on tracks.\n\nIn the signal chain, its position can drastically effect how other tools behave. Up front, it can help a bus compressor or saturation device behave more predictably, but may mush things too much. Near the end, it allows those devices to play a more colorful role but may cause weird behavior when using fast, \u201ctransparent\u201d limiters afterward. I like it first right now, most of our group like it near the end.\n\nThe hallmark signs of overuse for us were mixes that sound overly strident or when a vocal becomes inconsistent tonally from section to section as density changes.\n\nTools-wise, the group unanimously preferred minimum phase tools over linear phase or dynamic phase. OTT is a starting point, ear training to recognize that color. Once you hear it at 15-20%, you won\u2019t be able to unhear it on many pop records. After ingraining that color, ML4000 and C4 both have their own flavors that can do a thing while offering tweakability when needed.",

A lot of my bread and butter is contemporary classical/microtonal/experimental music and I'm in this world as both an engineer and often as a producer keeping track of how folks relate to the score and each other, take maps, etc. I tend to agree with some of the above that trying to chase down inharmonic relationships with EQ can make things worse, but I appreciate @LAPhill posting about bassoon/flute overtone series. @spectrummasters original question was about understanding the low mids and how they relate to EQing depending on the key; I think for me the way that understanding overtone series, tuning systems, and musical interactions in acoustic/orchestral instruments can relate to pop or rock mixing is like... Sometimes when I hear clashes between instruments playing thirds or clashes in the harmonic series and I'm trying to clear space in the mids/low mids, I do think about what instruments want to be occupying that space. So perhaps in the bassoon/flute example, I'd want the flute's fundamental to be stronger than the bassoon's first harmonic at C5, and that might look like EQing down the bassoon in the ranges of the flute's fundamentals, or in a rock mix looking at the bass's harmonics compared to where the lower range of the guitars are living. Obv instruments are moving and changing notes so none of this is surgical so much as the keys of the songs or the instruments' ranges might inform some general decisions about where to make space rather than just \"cut 300 on the bass\" or whatev",

I tend to buy plugins to save time when projects come in. \n\nIn the order I'd range these kind of tools mentioned here:\n\n1. soothe\n2. speccraft\n3. reso and all others\n\nIf you have soothe, you're good imo. \n\nI liked this one (speccraft) because it gave me more control when I needed to chase a more targeted frequency without affecting the rest (i.e vocals, bass gtr, etc), stuff like that, but I use these kind of tools sparingly. cymbals, egtrs cabs, things like that, almost never on the mixbus because IMHO (don't shoot me), soothe-like tools, affect too much of the signal - suppressing resonances/frequencies \"killing the depth\" because of the pushing down of reverbs, delays, etc. That is not to say I never use it, there are times for everything, and every tool has its place but yeah. There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

It\u2019s a very particular setup that was derived from what he hears and simply using a small fragment of the compiled setup isn\u2019t going to be much helpful to me at least. What would have been useful is probably Waves Manny Marroquin plugin style package. \n\nThe reason why it made me think he may not use the plugin is because he had a few different ozone presets that he uses on different mixes.

Took out punch) and it was a super good enhancer. i even like the high band for smooth air. low band is not really nice to me cuz i like to boost subby lows on the mixbus but this low band reaches too high on the spectrum. So ya, all in all good plugin. may needa grab it. Highly suggest people check it out and report back on here",

It's indeed important to use it where needed tho, I see it as just another tool in my toolbox, but I will use saturation or compression when I feel like that's what the sound needs. Good to hear that it's not just about mindlessly throwing clippers on everything.\n\nApart from that I think doing anything to dynamics is always better if done in stages. Different stages of compression, limiting and in this case clipping, so I definitely think that's a good approach",

Handy tools for starting points if you need them.

The only problem I see with this is that you don\u2019t know how other consumer dacs are going to respond to a signal that goes above and stays over 0db. It\u2019s probably just going to clip anyways cause it won\u2019t be able to handle the level. Honestly I would recommend trying an experiment with a limited, clipped, and just gain driven version and listen to them everywhere you can (Bluetooth speaker, phone speakers, AirPods, car) and see if it distorts over 0 - and then make your decision from there. It\u2019s a different loudness game in electronic festival music for sure so they may not even mind the distortion but most mainstream leaning tracks won\u2019t benefit from it",

Generally I prefer the sound of shifting things separately - and at least on my system Soundshifter almost always has unpredictable and inconsistent stereo imaging artifacts so I usually prefer using other tools for as many tracks as I can do.  Most of the time since I'm working in Ableton I'll use the pitch shifting modes there (Beat warp on drums for example, tones or complex on individual harmonic instruments).\n\nPlay around with different shifting algorithms to get the results you want.  Be warned though that Soundshifter definitely has its own character/tone so if the producer/artist are really used to that sound they may wonder what happened if it goes away.  At the very least I'd try and warp your drums and vocals separately from the main instrumental if it were me!",

In theory I get that you want to clip your transients to get them even and then maybe you can have exacting control over how much transient you actually want in a mix with the shaper post clipper, but I've yet to a find a situation where I'd ever want to bring back transient post clipping. Maybe that's because I'm mostly working in the live instrumentation / drum kit space where I'm basically trying to lessen the 20 dB+ of dynamic range on a kick or snare or drumkit at large. Shaving off 6 (or more!) dB of transient on a played snare drum still leaves you with a pretty transient rich snare drum. But I'm still curious about use cases...",

    "content": "Hey everyone, so a couple months ago I went to a workshop with one of the guys who worked on the loudness standard team for the european broadcast union and it was really interesting how he thinks about all that and how it translates to his mixing workflow in particular. So for those of you who don\u2019t know in broadcast you have to hit a loudness of -23 LUFS +-1dBTP throughout the program. This is especially tricky with live program as you can imagine. But having this fixed loudness target also has a major advantage, it\u2019s that you can have a fixed volume setting on your monitoring and with time you kinda know how loud you\u2019re mixing compared to if you\u2019re mixing for peak loudness, where you\u2019ll always land on different loudness depending on the program. This was the first time I really understood the advantage of that way of working, because with time you\u2019ll be so tuned to the loudness target you\u2019ll be able to really intuit every move. And since -23 gives you boatloads of headroom you can really push things during mixing and then still get the density through clipping/limiting after that. It kinda ties in with what @Nomograph Mastering  was saying about fixed monitoring level. What do you guys think about that?",

The way I approached it was to build the mix with loads of headroom, then when it was all sitting roughly where it wanted to be, I\u2019d alt+drag the input/output of Saturn to wherever it sounded good. It was usually followed by The Glue or another compressor (not always). When I first started using it I was thinking about where the harmonic stages would happen in a (Un)fairchild. I guess probably pre and post compression? There\u2019s probably arguments to compress pre saturation, but I auditioned compression before and after Saturn and preferred it post on that occasion, so that\u2019s how it stayed in the template.\n\nThe Pro-Q curve hedged against a tendency I had/have to mix too smiley, and all in all it seemed to make things sound more gooder so the duo lived on in my template\u2026 until it didn\u2019t.",

    "content": "I wouldn't think of it that way, unless the partials are really, really prominent. The first few harmonics can layer up to make a pronounced 5th or octave that's stronger than the sum of its parts, which can have unintended consequences. Like the 5th an octave higher on a power chord interacting with something on a bass note an octave lower. Sounds great until you have, say, a third instead of an octave between the guitar and bass. Suddenly your overtones are interacting in non-musical ways that usually create an unpleasant and out of tune smearing right where you want musical harmony to speak clearly. Again, all of this can be used with intention.",

So I'll give you my general observations and y'all can take me at my word.\n\nI dropped the input signal to -20dB and then played around with boosting at 100Hz (where my test tone is) to see if the harmonics were different for different EQ band types. I tried a *bell*, a *low shelf*, and a *tilt shelf* to boost.\n\nI was able to boost it +16dB in both *subtle* and *warm* mode before I got any of that harmonic breakup that we started to see in my previous tests as we got approached -0.03 dB. It appears that distortion on *subtle* mode (once again) doesn't kick in at all until the output signal gets within -4dB of 0dB on the output meter. The *amount* I boosted did not matter. The distortion only came when the signal crept close to 0 on the output meter.\n\nAll three band types appeared to behave the same when it came to harmonic bloom.\n### tl;dr:\nI did not detect any difference in behavior with different EQ band types. So they appear to behave the same. It's looking like the breakup doesn't kick in until the output level of the signal is within -4dB of 0dB on the output meter. *Then* they start to break up.\n\nThe only exception is the 1st order harmonic at -22dB that appears as soon as you enable *warm* mode. That's always present, no matter how hard you're driving it.",

So it seems that the transfer curve is biased to break up in the low end sooner and you have to drive it *way* harder to get bloom after 2kHz.\n### Warm Mode only\nThe 1st order harmonic seems to gradually drop 6dB in amplitude as I sweep my test tone from 30 Hz up to 1.8 kHz.

If I can do a little rotation , some distortion and compression and then work on balance \u2026.ill be moving in the direction I\u2019m aiming for",

    "content": "Loudness question: I\u2019ve been struggling with drum samples and bass/808s specifically. A lot of these sounds come in so dense and compressed, they sound good in level close to 0dbfs but they don\u2019t have the knock and energy they had when they are turned down to create headroom. Especially when it\u2019s playing with other instruments that are more dynamic. A lot of times they even sound smaller and thinner too. So I\u2019ve attempted using samples that have taller peaks but at the end of the day I end up doing similar treatments (distortion, clipping) to get the level of density and aggression. Which also leads to another question about transient treatments. I\u2019ve watched tutorials on this topic and some people used clipper to have the limiter work less, and the others work slightly differently by preserving the peak and using parallel to create density. I tried both ways, but still left me with the issue of not being able to crank it louder without messing things up. With the dense drum samples, the rest of the mix would start choking every time the drums hit. Generally I find it so much easier to get things to compelling loudness when there\u2019s no drum instrument (I find percussive elements with higher pitches easier to fit in the mix). How can I work around this?",

It\u2019s a modular multi effect plugin, and making a few different presets on it allows me to quickly switch around between different colors and modulation. It has random parameter set feature and can unexpectedly bring in interesting sounds quickly too. Other than that, I also like Soundtoys stuff for phaser and tremolos, ubermod for chorusing and other phase effects on the delays. For reverb, Dverb is actually pretty cool especially when it\u2019s mixed in with delays. I like Valhalla vintage verb and eventide ultraverb as well. And for post verb or delay saturation, decapitator and spectre. Saturn if I wanna use the dynamics control on it. I also like messing with the polarity, sometimes flipping it can get the presence of the tail heard better without obscuring the dry sound as much.",

Jon mentions it here, Jaycen mentions it elsewhere.\n\nI actually come from producing on FL so I'm quite familiar with the clipper there and the sound that it gives off. Most people use it on their master channel so when they bounce their stems, it's my understanding that they lose whatever sound they were getting from master processing (which sucks since it'd be nice to retain that stuff. Side note, any thoughts here)? \n\nI've used Ozone 9's limiter as a clipper on a drum buss while paralleling with soundtoys little radiator for that \"FL\" sound (as per Jaycen). It does sound nice, although I wouldn't say it quite matches the FL clipper. Jon mentions the tracks clipper -\n\nCurious to hear anyone elses thoughts.",

(i'll rewatch when they post it back up)  Its this cutting / scooping of the high mids (up at c.1-6khz) that ive never heard much about before, Im interested because i dont like crushing my mixes to get a higher lufs and if this is an effective way to get their smoothly im v interested in learning more....im happiest with my mixes at -12 lufs but will push to -9 ....but id like to get to -9 with as little sacrifice to the fidelity and low end as poss.\nIve also heard recently (I think i heard it from colin leanord talking) something about the trap guys always scooping out the  second octave harmonic   of the bass ? c. the 110-130hz region....Is anyone familiar with using this? (eg.  the  \"missing fundamental\" and all that good stuff)",

    "content": "@Eric Martin thanks for your reply man, re: clippers vs compression......yes i am familiar with that. I dont use compression for dynamics control either....you may have heard of the \"clip to zero\" strategy? i do a similar thing but then output my limiters/clippers at -6db instead of 0. Its similar to what johns doing just catching peaks and not squashing the life out of everythin....mike dean does it too IIRC. \n\nRe: spectral shaper : I didnt actually spot jon using his spectral shaper in that 1-6khz region, i saw it in the low mids....so having heard you and @oaklandmatt both mention it ...it seems hes defo already using this high mid scoop trick then! Ill still research the maths of the lufs algo because i like to really understand the psycho-acoustics and science of these sorts of things. Im after the ultimate mix in this life, lol .....i come from underground club music, where drums and bass and a sweet vocal are everything so its a constant balance/re-balance between lows/mids and highs as i learn more advanced techniques\n\n..re: jons mix yesterday and clipping, and you mention clipping the attack portion of a sounds adsr , did you notice how much he uses transient shapers on almost everything? v clever. Personally, i love transients and fight hard to keep them and jons trick of putting a transient shaper after a clipper/limiter has been a revelation....(thanks @oaklandmatt , that gem came from your LWMR) .....bruce swedien said compression is for children, and i believe he evangelised about not killing transients ...i love a transient shaper and a clipper ....compressor , not so much.",

    "content": "right, there was a spectral shaper on low mids on one of his buses, but then again on the mix bus it was doing the 1-6k.\n\nI think from what I understand that JC is doing he is controlling the attack so it\u2019s consistent, then using the transient shaper to make sure it\u2019s the same for every hit. It is smart, and for his workflow it\u2019s also fast and easy.\n\nI use compressors a lot, but I\u2019m also working in mostly indie rock with acoustic drums and bass guitars not 808\u2019s and drum machines, which is a drastically different world. I also think I\u2019m doing what most people don\u2019t do and I don\u2019t always love the artifacts of compression so I generally use slow attacks to maintain transients and fast releases to recover quickly (I adjust so that I get the fastest release before audible distortion)\n\nBTW Bruce Swedien while he may have evangelized not using compression don\u2019t underestimate that his greatest works were done to tape and even when you were conservative and didn\u2019t hit tape hard, the transformers going into tape and out of and the tape as a medium itself would peak limit attack heavy instruments like drums",

But what about subgroups?\n\nIn my production routing I\u2019ve got subgroups for drums bass guitar synth vox etc. So say I\u2019m bouncing stems for my mix engineer. The drum stems they get aren\u2019t gonna add up to what I\u2019m hearing right? Because they\u2019re going to hit my drum bus compressor one by one?\n\nI think a good example is Disclosure sending Jon the stems for Talk. Guy always has a drum bus with Oxford Inflator, Saturn 2, and an API-2500. But when Jon gets the stems the drums are going to be individually compressed and thus not what Guy was actually hearing right?",

As i understand it, it's not your DAW clipping it, its the audio leaving the daw and clipping your convertors. \n\nMy guess is this is Hard/Digital Clipping. But when I export the audio in the above scenario and compare it with the same thing but with a hard clipper plugin on the master, they do not null out.",

    "content": "A hard clipper will behave differently than the digital clipping that occurs when you clip your converters or when you export a signal that exceeds 0db at a bit depth of 24bits. Your daw works internally at 32bits floating point, which means that your individual faders will have a lot of headroom above 0 db, so you can go pretty much as high as you want with them, as long as you turn the signal down in a later stage before it hits the final output. Otherwise you will be clipping your converters like you said. This clipping will be different for every converter, and it's why mastering guys buy converters that are worth more than your car, just so they can get a certain flavour when clipping their a/d (although I'm pretty sure most have stopped doing this, because it often just sounds like shit lmao). Clipping your signal with a plugin will introduce different distortion/saturation/artifacts. It will even be different between different plugins and between different algorithms inside of those plugins (if you are able to select those)  (some clipping plugins actually use the exact same algorithms, so those won't have any differences ofc. EDIT: the only differences here would be in the oversampling functionality etc. of the plugins used, not in the actual clipping algorithm. There actually aren't a lot of hard clipping algorithms out there, so most differences between plugins will be in the way the anti-aliasing filters work)",

You rendered the audio out, so what output you had selected wouldn't make a difference. The best way to test this would be to record the actual output from the Apollo and from your Mac.

THEN you can use something ultra transparent and awesome like a Dave Hills titan to control dynamic on the way in and really increase your chances of keeping the vocal right in the magic spot without risking overs. \ud83e\ude84 You can do it with a studio\u2019s 1176, you just have to figure out the sweet spot before the artist gets there and be willing to adjust on the fly",

The slowest attack on a SSL GComp is 30ms. \n30 ms is around 33hz, which is around 1 full cycle of the lowest perceivable musical note for us (B0). \n\nI wonder if thats why that setting is so popular. allowing a full cycle to develop, will lets us hear that pure sinewave without distortion while still compressing. \n\nYou could make presets for attack settings for all the 12 notes in the lowest octave. To always have the fastest attack that lets through at least one cycle of the lowest note in the song/key. \n\nI wonder if Letting the tempo decide the release to dictate the kind of groove/feel the song has. Maybe a Rythmic value? a 16th? and 8th? swung 16th or 8th? \n\nFood for thought. I know \"use your ears\" and i do, always. but i just noticed that i and others gravitate towards settings that land around these points of interest and or their multiples.",

It\u2019s very elusive to describe what mind is, once you remove yourself from the biological debate.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Neuroscientists, like all scientists, are quantitatively driven. If you can\u2019t measure it, it doesn\u2019t exist. Since you can\u2019t measure mind, you can\u2019t quantify mind\u2014so by definition, it\u2019s not physical. If it isn\u2019t physical, then either it doesn\u2019t exist and is just an illusion, or we have to establish that there is a reality that we can\u2019t measure. And that\u2019s where the fulcrum of this debate actually is\u2014how do you know something exists if it\u2019s not measurable?",

I\u2019m curious what folks\u2019 methods are for using clipping and limiting from single sources, busses, to the 2 bus. \n\nI feel like part of my issue is not giving myself enough headroom for the louder sections of the song to develop into, but I\u2019m thinking that my problem is how I\u2019m perceiving the role of the 2bus limiter and how often I \u201cwant\u201d it to be triggered, and how much dynamic range needs to be controlled at the bus level beforehand\u2026 I aspire to be a wizard someday \ud83d\ude05\n\nThanks!",

So if you end up not digging the clipped drums vibe you can still get some mileage out of the plugin for fuzzes, distortions, etc",

I'd say try both and see what works for you.",

Focus on getting the EQ targets dialed in with your mix, and the input target not clipping..  This taught me SO much about loudness.  My mixes consistently hit -9rms and -9 lufs when I get them dialed with EQ, and I no longer get the \"smushed\" feeling I used to get when trying to get loud. The mix actually breathes and is loud AF. Then when I get the eq targets dialed in, I see where I am hitting large amounts of peaks over 3-4db on the limiter, and then I address those peaks at the source in different ways. The God Particle I truly think can be a teaching tool, as well as a great sounding mix bus tool. I am now using it less and experimenting with my own chains. But seriously, this may help you as it helped me. The GP does not suck and I will always have it in the bag as sometimes it is just the right sauce.",

    "content": "I use an Analog VU meter on the output of my monitor controller built by the inhouse tech who also worked at Neve (he designed and built the 8816 summing box) - he recommended the Sifam ones because their ballistics are really good - which I think is the main argument for analog vs digital. I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

Like, why is the snare thwacking in song 1, but it's thwocking in song 20? Would be easy to second guies, start EQing again and ruin the rest of the show. Absolutely if you're chatting to Kaplan, it'd be great to hear - I'm sure the Discord generally would appreciate but I'd love to get his inside track, please!\n\n@cian riordan Great shout on mindset, thank you.

Then my brain goes - let's remove that. \nI've been digging deeper lately into the API style of EQ and it occurred to me that when going through the preset list -  most of the presets were doing additive stuff. I find this very interesting and when it comes to \"surgical sounddesign\",  a new workflow for me. Like - I don't like the low mid on this snare.

    "content": "\u201cThe Inflator is not the same as the Enhance feature in the Oxford Limiter, although the effects might be considered similar. In simple terms, the Inflator is a special kind of distortion generator which has no dynamic activity over time. It's a static process. It gives the impression of loudness by providing the harmonic cues we associate with loud and stressed sounds, increasing the harmonic density of the material in a way that is sympathetic to the ear.\n\nThe Oxford Limiter's Enhance function is a special kind of 'dynamic' process that does not add distortion to steady state signals. It works over time, programme history, peak and average levels and left/right stereo differences to limit the signal and squash peak events, while providing the listener with the impression that the peaks are still there. It can sympathetically remove peak events so that you can provide more transparent limiting, or make the programme even louder without causing sample value overs.\u201d",

    "content": "And from the manual:\n\u201cThe enhance process improves the perceived loudness and presence of the programme material by modifying the dynamic and harmonic content of the signal. Since the method used is different from the Pre-Processing section, it can further enhance the perceived volume of a previously processed signal, while suppressing all signal overloads. As the limiting action does not involve conventional sample value clipping, harsh distortions are avoided, and programme detail and dynamic information is largely retained.\n\nAlso, since the plug-in has internal headroom, transient levels greater than notional maximum modulation can pass from the Limiter section into the enhancement stage. This means that percussive overshoots, that would normally be lost in a conventional limiter (or would give rise to overloads), may be included within the sonic results of the plug-in, producing both richer dynamic sonic detail and a useful reduction in the perceived artefacts of the limiting process, all without giving rise to any sample value overload.\n\nThis property enables slower attack times to be used in the Pre-Process section, without creating output overloads, which would otherwise result in a need to reduce output levels.\u201d",

The compromise is less saturation, but I think I like the separation (the fabfilter or Ozone limiter was only ever doing 1-2dB of work, but still completely changing that final spectrum. I'm having trouble telling how soon my mixes overload with the Pro L-2 unfortunately. Do you think wider is better? or is a trick and it's too wide, and all that width is overload?

I'm going to add that output attenuator but I'll leave the unit stock. I love the way it sounds! Now I'm curious to hear the ones modded for Electrical Audio though. Did you have the chance to hear them during the St. Vincent recording? Anyway, this is what Greg said about it:\nHello,\n\nYes, my typical modification will change the sound of the preamplifier. The distortion and noise is much lower when the conversion is done. If you are happy with the way yours sounds, you could simply add an output attenuator, like you say. There is a part that is popular in the DIY world for making 1176s.  It is a 3-section 600 ohm \u201cT-pad\u201d potentiometer. You can find it on the Capi website.  \nIf your unit does not currently have a 600 ohm output load resistor, you may want to add a switch to engage the attenuator. Simply having it in the circuit will load the output with 600 ohms. This might lower the headroom and change things a little bit. \n\nGood luck with your project,\n\nGreg Norman",

    "content": "Hey all. I've got a strange dilemma and I'm hoping you can help me solve it.\n\nI'm hearing a chuffy low distortion on these hi-hats when I reference them on multiple playback systems. The thing is they're clear as a bell when mixing on my TwoTwo 6's. Super clean. The distortion only happens when I listen back on my AirPod Pros, my JBL Flip 5 bluetooth speaker, and a shitty pair of Tannoys that I have, and it's not subtle. \n\nThe distortion sounds like it lives around 300-400 Hz. Can anyone else hear it on their system?",

A lot of it stolen from @cian riordan and from this Discord, lots of wisdom from @Nomograph Mastering included.\n\nMinimal buss compression (1-3db on loudest sections of a mix), usually some kind of tape saturation (typically Slate Virtual Tape Machine), and Pro L2. The limiter is only grabbing 3-4 dB for the most part with the odd drum hit or whatever hitting more. Rarely I\u2019ll add in other processing to push things harder for a specific mix, but 95% of the time that\u2019s it. Then it\u2019s sub busses or processing on individual tracks to get the level and compression/limiting needed to get things slamming. Then for mastering I pull the gain on Pro L2 down 6 dB, print and call it a day.",

I'm hitting my multiband different, hitting my clipper different, hitting my limiter different; so if I were to simply execute that note, now the vocal, guitar, pretty much everything shifts a good bit in energy and I then spend time making the mix work again now that a big chunk of energy got pushed up in it.

I like how it sounds, it\u2019s very subtle but it does the thing where it sets the whole mix in front of you and you can separate sounds more easily. Kinda like when I turn on oversampling on a limiter or clipper, where you get less peaky distortion. While that is great on the other hand what I notice is that transients get less \u201cvisceral\u201d, like putting over a blanket or something (really hard to discribe I find). How do you guys feel about that? I\u2019m honestly a bit lost with how I want to approach it, cause I see the benefits but also I\u2019m not sure about the trade offs",

I\u2019m not sure about his take on oversampling, since the drawbacks of that are another thing to consider. I think with increasing processing power it might be worth trying to run sessions at higher sample rates or is the drawback of samplerate conversion of lower SR files gonna outway that again?",

I blamed my chain for days but when I opened another vocal done through the exact same chain the following day from another artist it was like butter so it\u2019s obviously inherent to the vocal which makes sense in hindsight.  \n\nAny ideas on how to bring out some more clarity in the top end and not exaggerate that? I\u2019ve tried sooth, had a brief look at declicking in rx, spectre. What\u2019s worked the best so far has been using Accentize spectral balancer to clamp the top end and then clariphonic to bring it back up and that has helped. \n\nIt\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019d imagine rx to reduce the noisy component in that frequency range would help but your air is essentially a noisy component. \n\nAnyone ever came across this grain? \n\nThe style of music doesn\u2019t demand crazy top end so I could just embrace the warmth but I\u2019d love a bit more articulation. \n\nSorry for the long post",

Also, there's pronounced proximity effect on them as well, so I sort of feel like I can't work effectively with the top end and I can't make them big in the low mids either and just whatever I do sort of make them a little worse.

I haven\u2019t gotten good results with bloom on female vocals so far, but I know that one day it will be just the thing needed. I think that probably RX will yield the best results, but for some reason I find myself resisting digging in with RX on this, probably because I know it\u2019s going to be hard work and I\u2019m a little lazy. Good lazy, though, because if I\u2019m not I try too hard and end up taking away what\u2019s good. \n\nI don\u2019t have Ozone, but maybe this is what will push me over the edge to try it, hmmm. \n\nI was thinking that maybe some sort of tape thing could work, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work with Tupe inmediately and the UAD Ampex made it brighter and more distorted. It kind of feels like it\u2019s already on the edge of breaking up too much and becoming unpleasant, a bit like being touched softly on the arm when you have a fever and it\u2019s almost painful.

Once on the phone, you can blend the parallel with the bass in a way where there\u2019s little to no audible difference on a monitor, but the illusion of a bass can be heard through the harmonics playing on the phone.\n- It\u2019s a balancing act, but there\u2019s almost always a nice sweet spot to be found where it doesn\u2019t change the quality of the sound enough to be intrusively perceived on HD speakers, while giving life to the bass on lesser speakers.\n\nThis has helped my bass translate to more systems, and is the only time I find myself wanting to use the CLA76.",

I am so glad to have figured out what it is and shaved it down but man. It\u2019s wild how you\u2019ll *hear* that something doesn\u2019t sound right but you don\u2019t know what to even call it.",

Background noise is going to be quite a lot louder than A/D noise unless you have a really old interface, or really quiet signal. Even in ideal conditions, DI\u2019s are unlikely to have more than 100dB in dynamic range.\n\nThere\u2019s also a thing where a lot of amp sims need REALLY high (like un-intuitively loud) signals. To reach \u201cunity\u201d gain in Softube\u2019s Marshalls or a lot of Amplitube amps, you essentially need to be just below clipping and then boost another 10-15dB or so",

Im totally new to doing any kind of intentional or thorough mixing. I got back beginner stuff (hip hop) and so far only two track projects,;so I'm primarily focused on vocal clean up, mix, and production. \n\nI have a vocal that is loud and energetic but I believe was recorded too close to the mic (or too loudly). I cleaned up the take in RX as best I could and did some slight de-clipping on the really bad peaks. I've imported it back to PT, and took some of the basic tips from the podcast notes into consideration. I want to clip gain the vocal and try to even it out without being transformative or destructive of the performance, but still taking enough liberties to improve it and learn something.",

I'm the type to bite off more than I can chew, but I usually don't mind the consequences of that. I actually have another song from a different artist that is much better, maybe I'll start with that. To be fair my question was very open ended since in reality I'm also just wondering how to approach a vocal chain and vocal production beyond simply copying a preset or blindly adjusting settings on various plug ins. Something like an eq, or even other things like saturation or simple sidechain on a reverb is simple enough to somewhat understand, but the culmination of various settings and layered effects does start to get complicated and a bit unintuitive.\n\nI think fundamentally I need more attempts and practice struggling on my own, but I also think it's helpful to see if at some point I can find a bit of guidance or collaboration to accelerate my learning and focus my vision and efforts more efficiently. I appreciate your response and will try to not overthink it and focus mainly on leveling the bars to taste and moving on to practice some tuning on the vocal after. Thanks again !",

    "content": "@Juliette Ok having heard the track, there\u2019s a solo synth bass in there which is well designed sonically, when that drops out and the bass guitar comes back in, everything from about 60-70 cycles and below disappears except for the kick. So yeah I\u2019d first try pumping low end into it, be it with EQ or subharmonic, followed by some (a lot) of compression. I\u2019m sure better people here have a better way to do this. \n\nThe DI itself doesn\u2019t have any overtones other than stuff you\u2019re finding unflattering, so you could try mult\u2019ing the DI signal out to an amp sim (even some guitar amps work here) to fill out the spectrum that the guitars aren\u2019t fulfilling \n\nI\u2019d also say the bass drum could use some augmenting of the low end  and maybe a bit of length in order to emphasise that impact. Because the synth bass atm has all the power, and isn\u2019t omnipresent, so it\u2019s leaving the rest of the arrangement even _more_ neutered as a result",

But retracking potentially means losing that *sauce* that\u2019s in the original tracking, which I really love.",

Usually I\u2019m low passing with ISOL8 to listen for limiting/clipping clicks. These artifacts are unable to be heard unless I have a low pass filter active but I theorize that they, along with the extreme compression subconsciously degrade the listening experience by discretely assaulting your ears to the point of needing to take a break from listening. \n\nMy music can be related sonically to clara la sans \u201canother night\u201d give or take more or less busy. (Keep in mind her stuff is cranked to the point of audible artifacts sitting around -7ish lufs integrated across the chorus).\n\nI arrange the mix well and leave 1db of headroom for summing on individual instruments whilst they are loud enough for my target of -10 LUFi across the chorus, meaning my mix is actually 1db louder than -10 with space to sum on the pre master bus. Leaving headroom means I can introduce less artifacts at the cost of having to squeeze the dynamic range of individual instruments more than otherwise.\n\nMy issue is that If I want to aim for let\u2019s say -8LUFSi across the chorus in a relatively clean way with minimal artifacts, I\u2019m forced to squeeze the mix to -7.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear y\u2019all thoughts on whether or not technically inaudible artifacts/distortion matter and whether or not it\u2019s really worth for me to squeeze my mix 2db more in the name of competitive loudness?\n\nPs. Please bear with me as I am trying to figure this all out solo. Feel free to criticize my approach.",
