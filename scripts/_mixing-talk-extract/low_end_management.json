Not \"download my e-book\" guys. This space is a rare resource and a gift in the world we work in, and it's not always going to confirm your opinion. I don't post every day because I don't always have something to say or to add value, but I do gain a beautiful new perspective on a subject from reading through here at least a few times a week that I wouldn't have had the thought of without this space.\n\nIf you're gonna go after this job for real, you're gonna have the craziest shit thrown at you from clients, collaborators, peers and heroes that you've ever heard. \n\nYour feelings will not be protected when you operate in this industry at a professional level. \n\nSo, learning to take it on the chin and ask \"what is there to learn here?\" in a moment you're challenged is what will make you grow and be resilient. \n\nI just re-printed a stem an hour ago for a background vocal I fucked up \"fixing\" the timing of in the chorus. The client was incredibly direct and insensitive of my feelings about it, and if I hit them back to argue what was \"technically correct\" based on the grid and subdivisions I was looking at, and why I was right, they wouldn't care. They wanted it different, so I saw it through their lens of how they wrote the part and corrected it to deliver for the artist. And you know what? That result was better than my feeling of what was \"technically correct.\" They were right. A beautiful reminder to serve the song rather than to check the box. \n\nThe older I get the more I equally trust my taste and remain open to learning something based on new information. Adopting that mindset will only serve you in the process of experimentation of self and collaboration with others.",

It lets you squeeze so much saturation out of a signal without driving things too hard. \n\nFirst, you drive your signal to the point where the loudest part starts to break up, then you use the de-emphasis to subtract that frequency from the saturation circuit and then you push the gain up even harder until you're on the edge of breakup again. Wash, rinse, repeat. \n\nWhat you end up with is a signal that's evenly saturated across the entire frequency range instead of only having the loudest parts treated, because they're all hitting the saturation at roughly the same level. This thing is amazing. It's the sound that I've been searching for for soooo long.",

It's more that everyone is chopping, clip gaining, and RXing to an evenness that softens and linearizes performances. \n\nThese tools work beautifully when shitty mic technique makes things boomy, or there's a few weird ss's on the pre-hyped TLM mic through the focusrite pre.\n\nBut it sounds like most people who learn the tools are overusing them like crazy. \n\nI'm trying these days to get off the details and try as much macro-mixing as possible.

I did a number on the drums but just couldn't get the low end to sync between the two. I ended up sending the mono bass to two mis-matched outboard compressors. They're totally un-linked and I just matched them by ear and wow... sounds so fucking good. Each one is grabbing and doing it's thing and it's *mostly* adding up to mono but gives real life when things momentarily lean left or right. Reminds me of a drum setup photo today where some of the mics were mis-matched and that's just honest-to-god so OK most of the time.",

So any 100Hz on the left now shifts to the right, and vice versa.\n\nSo say you have a rack tom with a fundamental at 100Hz panned hard left. Apply this filter to the S channel and its 100Hz fundamental will sound like it\u2019s coming out of the right side. But the top end of the tom will still sound like it\u2019s coming from the left.\n\nVery extreme example, but seen this happen IRL more than once. Easiest to hear this on headphones if you\u2019d like to experiment.\n\nI\u2019ve found the easiest way to avoid this is to use very gentle M-S slopes (gentle = less phase shift), shelves and bells, and especially avoid any steep HPF or LPF (18 dB/oct or greater).",

Yours sounds huge.\u201d\n\n\nBasically what I did, besides level & panning, was carve out a bunch of like 400 in all harmonic elements. All the tracks sounded good, but the density was all bunched up down in that range. \n\nAs I was explaining it to him, I had a moment of clarity about headroom. Doesn\u2019t matter if all frequencies are present for a big and tall mix, if all the headroom is getting eaten up by everything hitting the same frequencies, the collective volume of that is gonna make everything else feel quieter. \n\nI usually think of headroom in regard to low end and transients, but it\u2019s true for every part of a mix.",

The monthly tailspin, I know it well \ud83d\ude02\n\nOne thing that I have found to be very helpful to reduce masking / increase clarity  is to simply start by going track to track and listening for / EQing out non musical resonances and non-musical buildups. \n\nI am definitely NOT suggesting the aggressive hyper notching you see in a lot of YouTube tutorials, but a general track to track cleanup of obvious issues. Don\u2019t over think it, only attack the obvious things \n\nHypothetical Examples:\n- weird 1.5k resonant ring in the hats and overheads\u2026notch that thing down a bit. You\u2019d be surprised how much space that takes up in a dense mix. \n- high lead guitar part with extraneous rumble at 200hz\u2026not contributing to the musicality of the part\u2026byeeee\n- piano building up at 300hz in the choruses when everything is competing for midrange - automate EQ in chorus to create space \n\n\nEtc etc etc. \n\nSmall moves like that have made some of the biggest differences for me. Definitely not the fanciest tip, but simple EQ moves have been the biggest contributor to midrange clarity for me.",

    "content": "@BoozleBAM This is a GREAT question, and having read the whole convo twice I don't think it was really answered. Honestly I probably won't be able to answer it either, but here are some thoughts in no particular order\n\nFirst the usual caveat, I'm not a mixer and I haven't mixed a record in a decade. But I did record and mix for 20 years before that and followed the whole arc from beginner not understanding compression, to pro finding my way and getting to own or use all of the baller dream hardware. All that to say I have a lot of empathy for where you are at with it. These are not definitive statements, just aspects to think about..\n\n1) First something of a hot take that I don't see represented online. IMO compression often makes an individual instrument sound \"worse\". If you play and record something like drums well or acoustic guitar well, a compressed version will often sound *less real* and less vital. So why in the world would we do it???\n\n- The first reason is that we mostly don't care about how individual instruments sound, we care about the whole song. Often a compressed sound will play nicer in an arrangement than something dynamic, real and recorded in a \"documentarian\" way\n\n- The second reason is a trade off that isn't often spoken about. Compressed instruments often translate better into the wild. Take a beautiful, dynamic, real sounding, hifi & documentarian recording of say upright bass, drums and acoustic guitar. Listen in your studio in great monitors and it's a dream. Now go to Target and play it in mono on the overhead speaker on a busy saturday.....it just won't survive ... the song gets lost. Or drive with your window open, or cook dinner with the AC on etc etc.",

Eric came from tape and he was always cranking the high end on the record side going to tape to account for noise on mix down (easier to tame low end than it is to boost when you're mixing off of tape)... but there was a cool high end sheen that you'd get. So with Saturn, you just separate a high frequency band above what is really audible and just crank the gain on the warm tape setting. Obviously you can adjust to taste, but it's a great way to add a little air & excitement to some dull recordings.",

Eric's response was simply \"it has to sound great, they're paying us a ton of money\"... so everyone in the studio divided and conquered... I replayed the bass and some drum stuff, Eric replayed a lot of the guitars, we both added to the background vocals. The parts were all bone headed but it made such a huge difference sonically to be working with real sounds as opposed to the demo recordings that got greenlit by the label.

I\u2019ll duplicate this track (without inserts), maybe end up with 4 of them with different FX chains. It\u2019s no biggie just for a H-Delay and a vintageverb/metaflanger/ whatever.\n\nLike they mentioned on the podcast, this method encourages more experimentation for me, and also circumvents niggly things like trying to get a word to echo on the downbeat if it was sung on an offbeat - you just move the clip forward or backward in time. And if an Ess is too apparent, you can clip gain it down in the source etc.\n\nPlus once you have your verb throw set, when you in turn commit that throw, whatever it is about seeing the audio just suggests further details like having it cut abruptly on a beat, or reverse it, or fade it in, or EQ it etc.",

    "content": "I just posted something over in #\ud83d\udcf8show-your-setup talking about many different ways of recording a bass drum. I usually have between two and four, microphones for kick.  one is generally for low frequency if not two for low frequency, and the others are capturing different versions of the attack of the kick, I don\u2019t think too much about it. I just put the faders  up and start experimenting to see what I think is best for the song. I tend to think  a lot more about the physical drum and the treatment of the drum and beater  pedal more than I do about how I\u2019m going to treat the relationship between the mics.",

It's achievable both ways.\n\nBut since you're having trouble getting your verbs to pop out in the way you want, here are a few things that will get you there. Usually a combination of these things:\n\n**1.** Turn up the verb - Simple, I know.\n**2.** Make space for the verb - Mute or EQ competing elements.\n**3.** Increase your pre-delay time to the range of 60ms - 150 ms. This \"disconnects\" your verb from the source and makes it stand out more. And this sometimes means you can turn it down and still have the clarity. \n**4.** Use an echo instead of a verb - This sometimes does the thing and takes up less space.\n**5.** Use a slap echo instead of a verb - One and done. Gives you that room-y feel without taking up a lot of space.\n**6.** EQ muddy/thick/harsh frequencies out of your verb, so that you can turn it up louder without overwhelming the mix.\n**7.** Gently apply an effect (distortion, phaser, etc) that will make it contrast and catch the ear easier.",

    "content": "It seems like you might be spending to much time in the micro nuances of mixing. (Easy to do that)  try a new approach. Make quick moves and jump to something else, if the kick is too\u2026.. it will remind you everytime you listen. Try  to step back and listen to your mixes like a ME. Is there too much or not enough of a certain frequency range?  Then dive back into the micro move adjust and move on. This helps  you stay in the flow and to not get lost  in the weeds.  In my experience the music tells you most of what you need to know. Tempo has a huge effect on how the low end can work. Density often determines how midrange and upper mid/ high freq should work.  The elements in the mix should be serving particular roles and that informs where things should sit and ultimately equal how it makes you feel. I don\u2019t think very much when I mix but I react to what\u2019s in front of me . \nThe more you do this the more this will lock in. Another thing that comes to mind, is sometimes if I\u2019m feeling like something isn\u2019t right I\u2019ll do a save as or In your example I\u2019ll mute the kick and duplicate it and start from scratch and see if I can beat it. Sometimes order of operations can lead you down certain paths and as other elements enter the original moves might not being working",

    "content": "this is answer might not be the most exciting.\n\nActual Separation does not come from EQ, Compression and Saturation. These are just tool to help manipulate a sound into how you want it to sound. \n\nSeparation comes from Arrangement. If you have a Piano and a Guitar playing full chords in the same octave, you'll never get good sounding separation, no matter how much you try and manipulate the sound.\nSounds are made from a fundamental and certain overtones/harmonics. If they overlap, then they overlap, even if you add a random eq boost on each sound some Freqs apart, because someone on youtube did that. (not that you can't do it, and it wont work)\nBut Instead of removing good sounding parts of a sound forcing them to fit together(whatever that even means at this point), arrange the parts so they naturally fit together with separation. This way you'll be able to act more, creatively and instinctively on how you want the sounds to sound while mixing, instead of fitting a triangle into a circle. As the good old saying says, it starts at the source, for the best results. \n\nFx, in a typical jazz band, often a Bass will play roots on 1 & 3,  a piano will of then play the root and 5th an octave above that, and a guitar could play the 3rd and 7th, and together all the instruments make big full chords while also having their own space. this way there is now plenty of room for a singer or a Sax player to do its thing and not worry to much about cutting through a dense mix.",

No need to make it any kind of big deal or get preemptively defensive, (hence the thumbs down on Ryan\u2019s comment.)\n\nWhen you send your next bounce, include excitement for how the project is turning out and do the ask. \n\nIn my mind, additional production credit can be when you\u2019re doing more than replacing kicks & snares and editing/tuning vocals. If you\u2019re adding parts or fundamentally shaping groove elements, etc. \n\nBut I\u2019ve added guitar parts and replayed bass on songs I\u2019ve mixed and not asked for production credit when it really was about making the mix work. \n\nIt\u2019s a per project thing I think. I rambling, but it sounds like you\u2019re taking pride in the work and everyone is on board. Seems like a no brainer.",

'Descriptive language' = 'frequency' like @NoahNeedleman mentioned feels of limited use depending on whether you are a starter or finisher of the record perhaps. It's all relative and everything effects everything. I've started to imagine my arrangements / mixes in a sort of dynamic spherical (ish) three dimensional anti-gravity space where I can push and pull the objects of my arrangement / mix forward and back or up and down. I am still exploring this model / searching for better language. My producer brain asks is all the information already there. My mixer brain asks what unnecessary information came along with the objects of my mix. You can pull up or out and forward on an object with a shelf or bell shaped boost or you can push back and away or remove altogether the unnecessary information (HPF or low shelf) suspending what remains above. I have been exploring the latter and I think it has benefited my mixes with the perception of height and informing high frequency mix decisions.",

It\u2019s a habit I\u2019ve formed to make sure I\u2019m giving myself the maximum possible headroom in the low end, especially since I\u2019m primarily working with tracks recorded with microphones, and you can get some wild super sub stuff you\u2019d likely never hear but will clutter things up. And, for low-end elements, I find it can often help focus a sound. Sometimes a kick can sound much punchier and cleaner if you get the filter in the right spot, while retaining or even accentuating the fundamental and punch. Especially if you use a resonant peak on the filter. As far as phase shift\u2026 whatever. If it sounds good, it is good! PLUS you can use the phase shift to your advantage to futz with a sound that isn\u2019t 180 degrees out.",

After going back and forth and comparing for a while and taking breaks, I liked the LCD-X the least, just sounded weird and unnatural to me in the mid range, LCD-5s were my second least favourite which was surprising. I found Hats and things in that range had a really weird un-natural sound to them.. not sure how else to describe it. Just not for me. The Clear MG and MM-500s both sounded great, altho when i listened to some \"thicker/warmer\" mixes i'd done on the Focals, it felt like I would have scooped my mix too much if i'd been on them, because they were pretty full sounding/a bit boomy in the low mids/bottom, where the mixes sounded how i intended on the MM-500s. If i was buying with the intent to use them for production, or as a secondary reference, i'd probably go with the clears because they sound fun and were really comfy, have a bit more high end and bottom end.. but the mannys seemed flatter/sounded more natural in the bottom and top and more like what i'd want to hear while mixing i think.  Found a pair of demo MM-500s for a slight discount and pulled the trigger on them just now. Can followup in a week to see if after trying to mix on them i have buyers remorse or not \ud83d\ude02",

Four on the floor is actually really hard to get right, especially under the microscope of a multi mic\u2019d scenario where the low end can vastly change depending on how hard the drummer is hitting. If you hit a kick or snare a little too hard or if the drummer is flamming their kick and snare hits, it can choke the drum, kill the low end, and maybe present itself as being out of phase. But if flipping the phase is solving the issue, I guess it is phase related, which is interesting. \n\nFWIW, if it is performance related and I know the artist is down for me to be surgical, sometimes I\u2019ll just fly a good hit from the previous bar to replace the one that was flam\u2019d or choked or sounds out of phase. I know this doesn\u2019t work for every scenario, and some drummers might hate that if they found out, but I find that usually does the trick for me and blends in really naturally to a performance.",

In theory, this emphasizes what @Zack Hames and others said\u2014good choruses shines because of contrast. Often times, if you have a build up to a chorus or a transition into it, I like to look at the \u201ceasy to undercook\u201d elements like risers/rev reverbs, beat cuts, and harmonic layers/white noise to ensure there\u2019s that layer of \u201cooo,\u201d \u201caaa,\u201d and \u201cwow\u201d. Good rev verbs/risers shouldn\u2019t just be random white noise, I find a lot of success in tuning them and then automating the tuning so the pitch rises as well. Play with that. A great beat cut on the last count before a chorus is a killer idea. Try cutting the melodic elements and leaving the bass, maybe cutting everything\u2014listen to some Neptunes era stuff for inspo, or just more Neptunes in general honestly for pop music references.",

The only info I noticed missing from your anecdote (not implying it never existed) was if there was a conversation that took place with the artist and producer ahead of time what they felt about the mix as it stood before it came across your desk. This information informs me 99% of the time whether I will mix from their session, add my own thing, start from scratch (rare), etc. \n\nI\u2019ve had the opinion for a while now that over the next few years it\u2019ll be a repeatably employable trait if you can mix from people\u2019s sessions (including their DAWs). \n\nI usually find there\u2019s still some good contribution that can be done from us, a bit of cleaning of the low end and some vocal work. It\u2019s kind of fun when you embrace it.\n\nAnyway, overall kudos on this man!",

Most sessions of pro level mixers will be 80% the same plugin(s) because they know how they react. If something reacts weirdly, or a meter is going unusually berserk and doesn\u2019t match what they expect to hear, it prompts them to interrogate and make changes if need be - I.e. rogue low end rumble smashing a compressor.\n\nNo one single person working at a high level I know works exactly the same, but they have some kind of process in place that works for their brain and business.

I tend to try and find 2-3 instruments/vocals that will occupy the main focus of a given song or section, and just put those faders up and try and get them to sound amazing. Then everything else just gets gradually turned up and processed to fit in with or accentuate those primary parts. I\u2019ll often briefly solo them to high pass and usually subtly low pass, then sneak the fader up and not touch any solos again. Getting a track a little too quiet, and then hunting around with Spectre, an API style EQ, or Sie-Q for a pleasing frequency to accentuate works well for finding a spot in the frequency range. Also I will often aggressively scoop out low mids on sampled/software instruments as I find these almost always have way more weight there than needed in even a minimally dense mix. FX may be added at any point along the line: if I know it\u2019ll be integral to the part I\u2019ll pop \u2018em on a bit while soloing at first, if not I\u2019ll sneak the effect in gradually with everything else playing. I definitely need to be fairly aggressive with filtering as things get more dense, particularly in the low end.",

I'll sometimes double the same octave or do an octave below.  It's usually way down in the mix but for me it usually gets me where I want to be much faster than trying a plugin, although the only subsynth generator I have is the Brainworx one which is kind of hit or miss for me.

I would start by going heavy handed on the most innocuous of the pile-up and see where that takes you. Saturation is a great way of doing this without making things pokey... but might be good to audition with an EQ first to see what zones you should focus in on. Once you have an idea of where you're going, then you can fire up Saturn 2 or Spectre or Neutron and go to work.",

But generally my approach might look something like this: First pull down the volume by a bunch. Then usually you\u2019ll want to add in some transients back again. I like Spiff for this to taste. Then sometimes Master Rebalance by Ozone can be a life saver. Especially if say the balance of some instruments are clashing with the vocal or the 808/bass is too loud in relation to everything else. Essentially I\u2019m \u201cunlimiting the beat\u201d. \n\nThen together with the vocal in the mix I\u2019ll try to shape the beat around the vocal with some subtle (usually reductive) eq moves. Something like dynamically sidechaining a bell on the hihat frequencies to the vocal can help a lot. Or I might also play with Spectral Shape. Some people get good results with sidechaining the vocal as a whole with trackspacer or soothe. Then if I\u2019m missing some super lows or excitement I might throw a Pultec/Bax-type EQ or Spectre on it. \n\nSo ultimately I\u2019m creating as much space as possible and give myself enough headroom to still do some typical mixbus moves.\n\nTo me this removes the need to do anything different on the mixbus.

Not to mention your return FX - verb times and predelay might need to be tweaked, possibly delay feedbacks etc. Everything\u2019s going to change, and keeping convincing/good feeling stereo image in things like verbs is one of the challenges.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen in any case, so for me it\u2019s about doing the science with your science hat on, taking a break, then fucking around with options until the voodoo clicks. \n\nIt\u2019s not the same mix or even really the same production at the new tempo - groove will change, relationship between rhythmic parts (the satisfying low end you fought for in the kick is suddenly slowing everything down) and consequently vocal parts and their associated time based effects all shifts.\n\nAnd with all that said: sometimes just blasting your printed mix with soundshifter sync mode beats everything I just described \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Alexis made some last minute lyric changes, recorded new lead vocals on his iPhone and I had to slot them into a verse. Wildest Pro-Q curves you ever seen, split across a bunch of tracks with different EQ and compressors for each word in some cases. I was pretty happy with the results in the end though, pretty imperceptible after everything went through the vocal mix chain.Took ages but it was a good ear training lesson. \n\n@jantrit \u2018s recipe above is a good methodology\n\n*Went back and dug it out, it was second verse of this track - 1:58 \"a lot to learn, a lot to earn\" was recorded on iPhone https://open.spotify.com/track/2yhKDrTVMCLBWYd0aIfOfy?si=1a2914797e6843d8\n\nIt's got a low double and the FX are such a part of the character; it's a context that allows this tomfoolery.\n\n\nIncidentally, just remembering some other stuff around that record. It was produced by Philippe Zdar (that particular edit was made less than two weeks before his tragic death), and I remember the stems coming in with all of their character baked in. Wouldn't say it's the band's best album, but some of the parts were awesome.\n\nA bass guitar came in with the hihat baked in to it, so I dutifully went back on emails asking for them separated, but that was how he'd printed it - they were sharing some piece of gear, and for whatever reason that's how they had to go down. Mark Ralph was mixing it, and at the time I might've had a bit of a \"huh, Zdar's supposed to be a professional, why is the hi hat on the bass channel\" sort of bullshit attitude, but that particular instance cleared that right out. Mark's response to anything like that was always pure acceptance and understanding that people work how they work and it's his job to do what he can with whatever he receives.",

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

I find that this is a side effect of everyone having the ability to be able to record from their home or wherever. It\u2019s becoming more rare to have a record made with the traditional producer/engineer team working on a record From beginning to end. It\u2019s more common a band will come in and track basics take it home for a few weeks try a bunch stuff out in their untreated room where they really can\u2019t tell if they are adding something to the arrangement that\u2019s muddying up a the song or if it  needs a different mic, positioning or eq ect. Or if in fact  it\u2019s an orchestration issue.  Regardless they add it and send it to a mixer and say it sounds shitty because it hasn\u2019t been mixed yet.  This is where I disagree with the whole \u201cthey\u2019ve been living with it for however long so just make everything better than what they had\u201d. Serban says somewhere down the line decisions haven\u2019t been made.

I can always give them back what they had but often the mix needs some things muted and calls for some big moves when the scenario above happens. I know some productions are not this case and require light lifting but in my world that hasn\u2019t been the case.",

    "content": "As a mastering engineer, I\u2019ve kept my monitoring level consistent for the past ten years\u2014at a relatively low volume. This isn\u2019t a rule, just my approach, and I do it because I know exactly how a finished track should sound in my room at that level.\n\nEvery system has a sweet spot, and if you can identify that in your setup, you\u2019ll get more consistent results. This ties into factors like speaker and amp combinations, how your speakers push air\u2014especially in the low end\u2014and how they perform at different volumes.\n\nMany speakers don\u2019t reproduce low frequencies accurately when played too softly. On the flip side, when pushed too hard, speakers often cap the low end, meaning the bass stops getting louder while the mids and highs continue increasing. This is common in everyday listening setups\u2014people crank their systems beyond their limits, causing an imbalance where the top end dominates.\n\nThis is one reason why working with a mastering engineer with a well-calibrated setup can be beneficial. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s only one way to do things\u2014some engineers work in less-than-ideal setups and still get great results. It all comes down to what works for you and gets you the sound you like.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s important to remember which i amsure you already know.... your ears perceive frequencies differently at different volumes\u2014this is a well-documented, non-linear effect. The way we hear balance changes with loudness, which is why understanding how your room and speakers respond at your chosen listening level can make a huge difference in achieving consistent, reliable masters. If you crank it... \"memorize\" in your ears how it should sound cranked. Then when you drop down to another level..\"memorize\" how it sounds there. You should then find a few spots you can use.",

Find a sound that sounds like you want it to, that doesn't have any low ned problems. now try a do a High-pass filter and look at the peak meter. It will most likely peak higher than it did before, with no audible benefits. Only do a High-pass filter, if you need to remove low-end, thats creating a problem or taking up space. low cutting to *be safe* is generally not great practice. Also if you do a lot of low cuts, vary the cutoff points or you will get a build up of that frequency. Lets say if you low cut everything at 100Hz... you will end up with a bump at 100Hz.

A significant number of my recalls for mixing end up being this up this down, but not as much, it\u2019s foggy sounding between the bass and drums. If I got more feeling notes I might be more inclined to go back and recut/re-commit those parts but being able to commit in analog and doing the bulk of tone shaping with analog this way vs down to a console I can get by using outboard without fucking with recalls.\n\nI almost always am closer to a good mix with my hands on the controls vs a mix I do with eyes and my mouse.",

I said recently on here that most young people in my circles are listening on AirPods>Phone speaker>cars. Most don\u2019t even have \u201cspeakers\u201d anymore and most of my productions / mixes are being previewed on Phone speakers. I think its fair criticism for todays music if the mix sounds dead on a phone that its not hitting right.....the phone shows up arrangement issues immediately imo. I come from a sound system background so low end is a vital melodic as well as rhythmic component for me but i cant deny that imo, speakers are a dying technology like technics 1210s were once mp3s came out",

I have 6 group buses: . Kicks , 808/Bass , Drums , Music, Vox , FX and only clip by 1-2 db at the mixbus . Nothing clips by design or accident anywhere else .....for rnb/hip hop build your mix the Alex tumay / mixed by Ali way , get that 808 up first, on its own ....as loud as you want it , then build everything around it afterwards. Filtering is your friend. Have nothing in the low end but your bass. Overall I\u2019d absolutely suggest watching Jon castelli mixing t Shine (he uses clipping well in there ) and mixed by Ali mixing YG , his mix balance and grouping is CHOICE. I say  somewhere between these two is the perfect rnb/hip hop mix lol . PS. I wouldn\u2019t  do any of that edm/clip to zero stuff, it doesn\u2019t work for anything other than serum madness.",

Boosting with SPECTRE is nice but any eq can help add weight to a vocal if you\u2019re boosting correctly. I would suggest having the dynamics tamed to your liking before boosting low end in a vocal because it can easily get out of hand\n\nYou could try duplicating the take, use RX de-reverb or whatever you can to remove as much ambience as possible, compress it heavily and blend it in. Obviously compression will bring out ambience so as to not let that become an issue try removing it beforehand. \n\nAVOX duo is a neat trick I use sometimes to help give a vocal some dimension. I use it on a send.",

It\u2019s that hardware LPFs don\u2019t have anywhere near the same amount of cascading delay differential. I.e. a software bass synth by default has a slight reverb that is phase canceling itself wellllllll into the passband (like all the way down iirc) just by the nature of it having a digital LPF bottlenecked at 44.1, where a moog filter has very little of that going on because the sample rate of the real world is infinite, or the speed of light, depending on how you look at it.",

Once he did this with all the elements, then he peels off the white noise and you supposedly have a pretty balanced mix.

Its goal is to make the overall artifacts of limiting more pleasing\n2) I find it faster, more versatile, and better for limiting than a Vari-Mu emulation. Not to mention the UI is way more helpful than what I'm used to with a plugin looking to remind us of a Fairchild or similar\n3) Yes, it just doesn't brickwall, and it has a vibe\n4) You don't Need Tupe if you have a saturator you already like, but I adore it.

This will require some careful sculpting. Once  all the   elements of the arrangement are  in, if it\u2019s still feeling muddy start muting different parts and see where you get relief. Then try and find what space it can fit it. I hope this makes sense",

The thumping of the bass drum. How loud the gang vocals were. All of it. I dont get opportunities to listen to music at loud volumes with good systems anymore, so that was quite revealing to me about how music should sound in the outside world.",

Or there are more adventurous circular 3D panning options that I find work well top end arps or vox chops.

So I\u2019ll saturate high end on vocals or bass to get more openness without harsh high end boosts, I\u2019ll use the same sort of settings on close mics on acoustic drums to get more attack and punch. \n\nThis is an Oversimplification but Nothing is bad in excess if it sounds good.

Maybe multiple midrange elements will be competing, but the ear can only focus on one at a time (in addition to the drums, bass, and maybe vocal) so YOU choose and shift the focus!\n\nMy second approach is to take two or more of the competing tracks, say kick and bass, and play them together. No point in soloing one. EQ one while listening through it to the other. You may notice that you can subtract quite a bit from the bass without losing its character, but the kick\u2019s punch is improved by the space you\u2019re carving out. I do this a lot with vocals, too\u2014focusing on the vocal inside a dense mix while subtracting from all the other stuff that\u2019s stepping on it. When the lead just finds its home in its own uncongested space, you know you\u2019ve got all the surrounding noise right.",

I love the way MAAT Santa Cruz does this ever so smoothly. \n2. I compress the bass with a compressor sidechained to a LPF(!), to get some low end body which is usually severely lacking. The LPF is set between 1000-2000 hz, attack 0-8 ms and release 200-400 ms depending on the tempo of the song/bass part. Reducing 3-5 dB on peaks. This gets me really far.\n3. If the bass is a shortscale, I\u2019ll use Goodhertz Tiltshift to move the low mids from around 200 hz to around 100 hz, out of the way of the guitars. \n4. Then I put an amp emulation on the channel. Whichever one floats your boat. Plugin Alliance B15, Guitar Rig, TSE BOD, whatever. I\u2019ll be boosting low end and cutting high end here, or before with a separate instance of Tiltshift. \n5. If I want the bass to sound \u201erock\u201c and cut, I send it to a parallel distortion, which can be anything. I like TSE BOD, which is another sansamp copy which  has a lot of sub. My trick here is to add a clipper before the sansamp to really get extra gnarl. Logic\u2018s stock Bitcrusher works great, but I\u2019m sure anything works.",

    "content": "For me there are certain conditions that when met help facilitate forward motion / growth. These are somewhat in flux and my efforts and consistency in meeting these conditions wax and wan. For one, prioritizing my health. Hard to mix when your lower back is in constant pain because all you do is sit down all day. Getting better sleep. Drinking less booze. Eating healthier. Getting a gym membership, etc...\n\nAnother big one for me was getting out of debt and saving up an emergency fund. Hard to care for mix clients when you have constant FUD about finances.\n\nI also think that mentorship plays a huge role. Not just you having a mentor but you mentoring others. Ideally at the same time. If you don't have an actual mentor you can substitute for some other authority you find online (i.e. puremix or mix for the masters subscription, participation in a discord with a bunch of audio Jedi, LWMR etc...). Not saying these are equal but better than nothing.\n\nThen remaining curious and being willing to try new shit.\n\nLastly constantly trying to improve my monitoring situation. The ideal monitoring situation will perhaps always be a moving target. But I don't regret a single hour or dollar spent in pursuit of it.",

    "content": "It\u2019s also worth listening if it\u2019s attack portion or the sustain that is getting buried. \n\nIf there is not enough attack on the bass, you can sometimes trigger sample (percussive sample, sometimes a really short foley thing) that has the right presence area to have a little something that adds a punch to the bass. I often just copy one note that works into other parts that don\u2019t cut through but this stuff only works sometimes. It doesn\u2019t really work with busier bass parts\n\nAnd sustain wise, compression can help when it\u2019s done right or make it worse when it isn\u2019t done right. Same with saturation. I think with sustain, there\u2019s a lot of nuance in how you want the sustain to sit- performance is a huge part of this. Sometimes there\u2019s too much bright stuff and it doesn\u2019t allow the sustain to be audible, if you can tell something\u2019s down there but you can\u2019t really feel it or hear it that might be the issue. I noticed when there\u2019s too much or wrong compression on other upper elements, it becomes an issue. \n\nAlso dup the track and start new and see where you can take it, sometimes there\u2019s too much going on and hard to track what\u2019s causing what.",

Mute everything.\n2. Pull up kick in and out (+ sub or whatever they've recorded). Play with balance and phase of kick out until it feels good (good is context dependent - sometimes that's deep/subby/slow, sometimes that's punchy/percussive etc).\n4. Bring up overheads along with kick mics. Flip overhead phase and play with balance til it sounds cool, or punchy, or whatever you're after. Sometimes there's a very obvious right or wrong answer, but often just figure out whatever works for the drum groove + arrangement + song. Where the bass sits can often help tell you what config will work best.\n5. Solo snare mics, get them in phase with each other (just listen together and flip usually snare bottom until the blend sounds cool to you - often I'm looking for whichever configuration has more \"thud\", but that's context dependent). \n6.Unsolo and check snares against kicks and overheads. If you need to flip the snares, flip both top and bottom (or whatever combo) together so their relative phase remains intact. \n6. Add in rooms, again flipping and balancing til shit feels cool. Do same for crush mics, any other flavour stuff.\n\nToms are usually my last concern. Unless the groove is tom heavy, they might do only 2 or 3 hits across the whole song, so as Ryan said - hand gate those fuckers and deal with them once the general sound is dialled in.",

Super handy for lots of functions - either very precise and malleable gate open and close on the audible drums themselves, but also for instrument sidechains, maybe Pro-MB ext input on a bass track, a sine generator under the kick / noise generator on snare, the Slate Trigger feeds etc. \n\nHaving the gate triggers as audio allows you to slide them a couple samples back and forth as needed for groove or faux lookahead. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s easier ways to do things (it\u2019s a somewhat old school technique), but making them is one of my prep steps and they do get used in every session.",

We\u2019re still on this learning journey so happy for any pushback or insight\n\nFor the most part, our group felt the tradeoffs of very subtle multiband often outweigh the benefits, since just putting those crossovers in the signal makes a bigger difference than, say, a dB of control.\n\nWe felt more liberal use of multiband can add an aggression and excitement that is very familiar and unique, and prefer treating it as a sweetener or energizer over the whole mix more than trying to control problem areas that could be addressed on tracks.\n\nIn the signal chain, its position can drastically effect how other tools behave. Up front, it can help a bus compressor or saturation device behave more predictably, but may mush things too much. Near the end, it allows those devices to play a more colorful role but may cause weird behavior when using fast, \u201ctransparent\u201d limiters afterward. I like it first right now, most of our group like it near the end.\n\nThe hallmark signs of overuse for us were mixes that sound overly strident or when a vocal becomes inconsistent tonally from section to section as density changes.\n\nTools-wise, the group unanimously preferred minimum phase tools over linear phase or dynamic phase. OTT is a starting point, ear training to recognize that color. Once you hear it at 15-20%, you won\u2019t be able to unhear it on many pop records. After ingraining that color, ML4000 and C4 both have their own flavors that can do a thing while offering tweakability when needed.",

A lot of my bread and butter is contemporary classical/microtonal/experimental music and I'm in this world as both an engineer and often as a producer keeping track of how folks relate to the score and each other, take maps, etc. I tend to agree with some of the above that trying to chase down inharmonic relationships with EQ can make things worse, but I appreciate @LAPhill posting about bassoon/flute overtone series. @spectrummasters original question was about understanding the low mids and how they relate to EQing depending on the key; I think for me the way that understanding overtone series, tuning systems, and musical interactions in acoustic/orchestral instruments can relate to pop or rock mixing is like... Sometimes when I hear clashes between instruments playing thirds or clashes in the harmonic series and I'm trying to clear space in the mids/low mids, I do think about what instruments want to be occupying that space. So perhaps in the bassoon/flute example, I'd want the flute's fundamental to be stronger than the bassoon's first harmonic at C5, and that might look like EQing down the bassoon in the ranges of the flute's fundamentals, or in a rock mix looking at the bass's harmonics compared to where the lower range of the guitars are living. Obv instruments are moving and changing notes so none of this is surgical so much as the keys of the songs or the instruments' ranges might inform some general decisions about where to make space rather than just \"cut 300 on the bass\" or whatev",

I consistently use a wide variety of techniques to get out of the current place I'm in, in order to discover or channel some new thing into existence. In fact, doing new things is essential for my creative flow. So I'm always looking for new techniques or methods to try to disrupt my habits. I even prefer to not be in a perfect listening environment so I'm not lost in the sonics.\n\nWhen mixing, I try to get almost completely out of that producer space and into a low volume, methodical, emotional and technical refining. Trying to make the production and songwriting ideas clear and impactful by manipulating individual things at a consistent volume in a consistent space (with great monitoring).\n\nFrom what I understand from folks like @Nomograph Mastering, mastering is an even more focused version of that mentality. Trying to connect to and magnify with subtle touches the intention and emotional space of the record.\n\nI also think that a lot of these things are personality based. It's part of the reason someone like me is still aggressively seeking the songwriting and production , while someone like Jon Castelli moved to mixing after producing for years, and someone like Ruair\u00ed has moved to mastering after doing what seems like every possible role in the music industry.\n\nI realize this may be my producer personality perspective.

I tend to buy plugins to save time when projects come in. \n\nIn the order I'd range these kind of tools mentioned here:\n\n1. soothe\n2. speccraft\n3. reso and all others\n\nIf you have soothe, you're good imo. \n\nI liked this one (speccraft) because it gave me more control when I needed to chase a more targeted frequency without affecting the rest (i.e vocals, bass gtr, etc), stuff like that, but I use these kind of tools sparingly. cymbals, egtrs cabs, things like that, almost never on the mixbus because IMHO (don't shoot me), soothe-like tools, affect too much of the signal - suppressing resonances/frequencies \"killing the depth\" because of the pushing down of reverbs, delays, etc. That is not to say I never use it, there are times for everything, and every tool has its place but yeah. There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

    "content": "For rock and folk music I generally just do subgroups like drums, bass, guitars, leads, bvs, lvs. For pop oriented songs generally more split out/ kick, snr, toms, hats, cymbals, fx, different synths split out etc. i just use soundflow scripts that solo and bounce what I tell it to and run it at night or at lunch. Freezing tracks first can make it go way faster. As for mixbuss, I take off my final limiter (or turn down the input, however the song was sent to mastering)\u2026 I\u2019m usually not compressing the buss hard enough for it to matter. Sometimes the sum of the stems ends up sounding better than the mix! Generally people are using them for their MD to create a live show, or for dance remixes etc. For sync most people seem happy with instrumental and accapella in my experience so far?  Also if your trying to key your mix buss compressor from a printed mix, freezing most of the session first (besides fx etc and aux tracks) seems to help the side chain feel pretty close to what the mix was. I don\u2019t bother with it though most of the time as I\u2019m doing a couple db at most on the buss comp.\n\nEdit: one other idea I\u2019ve messed with pre soundflow, is, if your just doing subgroups and have the routing setup, save your mixbuss as a track preset and when your ready to print recall it on all your masters and commit the tracks. It works for me unless im using too much uad etc.",

Also if it is double tracks like others have said I like to sit them in diff places tonally or treat them differently (diff verbs or pushing diff eq points) it\u2019s the differences in the hard panned sources that create width. When tonally different information reaches each ear at the same time your brain tells you it\u2019s wide! When it\u2019s only subtlety different like in the case of doubles it can end up sounding mono again. A lot of the time I like to pick two elements that are holding it down throughout the track (maybe guitar and Rhodes) and then hard pan those in opposite directions. This maintains the balance left to right.  So I guess try hard panning a mono element and then balancing it out with a totally different mono element the other side.",

Sometimes EQ works better. Sometimes doing nothing to the balance and just a lil clipping. But ultimately we\u2019re all looking for extra headroom to some degree and carving where we can. But yeah it\u2019s not a default move but can help some very dense arrangements breathe.",

Sounds like a movie, great work. I have no idea how to get distorted guitars to sound so distorted but not harsh on the ears simultaneously in such a big soundscape....sonically it reminds me of early drum n bass pioneers like photek, Dillinga and optical for sound design.

But fidelity cannot IMO be appreciated in these specific places. \n\nOfc there are exceptions. But try eating at a restaurant on a beach promenade in south Spain and the restaurant next to you has a speaker 20 inches from your head blasting a different song. And tell me you think the vocal is warm or the drums are punchy. I think, sadly for general non music fans what they find in music, is less quiteness it\u2019s not even about the song. \n\nWhereas I think the people who enjoy music, will appreciate that extra punchy drum sound or warm vocal and deep bass. And I believe those people use headphones 80% of the time. They might have a great speaker system at home. But how much time do we really have at home listening to said speakers? Headphones are with us on the go all the time. Everyone I know under 30. Listens primarily on headphones. Or their iPhone speaker. Sometimes a JBL at the beach or park, and every now and then a party speaker at a party while drunk. The ones who really really love music, either have an old vintage speaker set from their parents or a Sonnos/smart speaker type thing. \n\nI still believe mixing for speakers is important, and @Nomograph Mastering has a great point in speakers translating to headphones easier than vice versa. But I always make sure shit sounds amazing on my AirPods. I\u2019d rather sacrifice something in the speaker than the AirPods. But then again. I don\u2019t have the accolades you do. So I might be shooting myself in the foot. But that is my general philosophy.",

    "content": "Come on dude, there's a reason this type of misleading promotional pricing is ruled illegal - at least in the UK.\n\nI'm sure we're all savvy enough in here to understand that marketers earn their wage by exploiting weaknesses (widely documented and scientifically substantiated) in human psychology. The felt urgency created by countdown timers and sale price indicators (\"normal\" prices slashed out, bold colours advertising \"temporary - don't miss this\" pricing etc) causes consumers to make irrational decisions and hurriedly complete purchases they otherwise wouldn't have made. I guarantee everyone in here has felt those psychological pulls. I think that satisfies the definition of predatory.\n\nI was generally aware of rulings here, but looked into examples before posting, so here you go (https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/promotional-savings-claims.html):\n\n\n*\"Ads for a mattress sale which stated \u201c\u201cHALF PRICE\u201d, alongside a box with numbers counting down from \u00a3399 to \u00a3199 were ruled against by the ASA. Over the previous year, the mattress was shown at the higher price for 49.85% of the year, and at the lower price for 50.14%, and the price had alternated between the two each month. Because the promotional periods were essentially equivalent in length to the periods when the full price was charged, the ASA did not consider that higher price was the  established usual selling price (Dormeo UK Ltd, 13 October 2021). Similarly, complaints were received about a sale for Simba mattresses.  The advertiser did not provide the ASA with any pricing history to demonstrate that the usual selling price was genuine, however, the complainant provided screenshots which demonstrated that the reference price of the product had fluctuated over a three-month period, and that the mattress had been on sale for 71% of the year. Therefore, the complaints were upheld (Simba Sleep Ltd, 21 September 2022). See also J Sainsbury plc, 06 June 2018.\"*",

A little extra grit on some guitars and drums or bass and drums can do it\u2026  hard to say without hearing it and knowing more context.",

The \"absolute\" relationship between all microphones recording one drum will remain the same. Where things can get more complex is when drums are flaming...sometimes they add up in a pleasing way, sometimes they don't. When  the kick starts slightly ahead of the snare or vice verca it just adds up differently right? Live drums make complex tones and depending on the hit even the tone/pitch slightly changes. Lining up the hits (fixing the flams however you can make it work) changes the phase relationship. The most common thing I do is replace with a good (all lined up) hit when I can, or line them up. The phase flip mostly is done with bass notes (for me), but I 100% have found it to be a solution for some weird drum hit before....I attached a screen capture of some flams (from a really sloppy ccm recording)  just to help illustrate the potential problem.",

My OG mix had this really aggressive edge to it that I kinda liked but it also felt way too scooped in the low mids. I checked out my old session and turns out I had cranked a ton of 8khz on the mixbus (a move I haven't felt compelled to do since 2021). Related I've been really enjoying thick / dense / full bodied mixes that still have excitement / edge up top especially for vocals and I had previously struggled to achieve a similar 'heft' in my own mixes compared to what I was hearing. I think in the past I was too quick to zap low mid resonances in my vocals / guitars. So I've been experimenting cutting less down around 200hz-600hz and emphasizing more. But then I felt I was losing some of that edge / excitement by see-sawing too much with the low mids relative to up top. I've found cutting some 170hz clears much of that up for me (like oh hey there's my snare or more room for kick / bass), I achieve the thickness above in that 200-600hz range and balance that with the excitement around ~8khz.

I\u2019d calibrate d it nicely to 40 then remembered a spike stent lecture talking about how he changed his underground bass heavy U.K. sound to a more American sound when he made it over to LA.

I've had good results w/o individual track compression and just handling it at the bus level. Similar to what Rob said the greater the variation in timing and pitch the more width you can get. Tradeoffs there. Could also play around with formant shifting some with melodyne or alterboy. Could also experiment with high passing some of the layers up a decent bit to create more height / contrast",

Synthesizers rarely have low-level information to be revealed that can't simply be turned up at the source.\n\nOf course, you might want the distortion artifacts from compression, but I'd probably use a saturator module.\n\nThat said, if you're a mixer who has received an audio bounce of a synth, then... sure! Compression would be good for balancing poke-y stuff, controlling boomy low-end, or there could be some room tone from a re-amp signal, or some attack that needs to be accentuated.

The first few harmonics can layer up to make a pronounced 5th or octave that's stronger than the sum of its parts, which can have unintended consequences. Like the 5th an octave higher on a power chord interacting with something on a bass note an octave lower. Sounds great until you have, say, a third instead of an octave between the guitar and bass. Suddenly your overtones are interacting in non-musical ways that usually create an unpleasant and out of tune smearing right where you want musical harmony to speak clearly.

So I'll give you my general observations and y'all can take me at my word.\n\nI dropped the input signal to -20dB and then played around with boosting at 100Hz (where my test tone is) to see if the harmonics were different for different EQ band types. I tried a *bell*, a *low shelf*, and a *tilt shelf* to boost.\n\nI was able to boost it +16dB in both *subtle* and *warm* mode before I got any of that harmonic breakup that we started to see in my previous tests as we got approached -0.03 dB. It appears that distortion on *subtle* mode (once again) doesn't kick in at all until the output signal gets within -4dB of 0dB on the output meter. The *amount* I boosted did not matter. The distortion only came when the signal crept close to 0 on the output meter.\n\nAll three band types appeared to behave the same when it came to harmonic bloom.\n### tl;dr:\nI did not detect any difference in behavior with different EQ band types. So they appear to behave the same. It's looking like the breakup doesn't kick in until the output level of the signal is within -4dB of 0dB on the output meter. *Then* they start to break up.\n\nThe only exception is the 1st order harmonic at -22dB that appears as soon as you enable *warm* mode. That's always present, no matter how hard you're driving it.",

So it seems that the transfer curve is biased to break up in the low end sooner and you have to drive it *way* harder to get bloom after 2kHz.\n### Warm Mode only\nThe 1st order harmonic seems to gradually drop 6dB in amplitude as I sweep my test tone from 30 Hz up to 1.8 kHz.

    "content": "Loudness question: I\u2019ve been struggling with drum samples and bass/808s specifically. A lot of these sounds come in so dense and compressed, they sound good in level close to 0dbfs but they don\u2019t have the knock and energy they had when they are turned down to create headroom. Especially when it\u2019s playing with other instruments that are more dynamic. A lot of times they even sound smaller and thinner too. So I\u2019ve attempted using samples that have taller peaks but at the end of the day I end up doing similar treatments (distortion, clipping) to get the level of density and aggression. Which also leads to another question about transient treatments. I\u2019ve watched tutorials on this topic and some people used clipper to have the limiter work less, and the others work slightly differently by preserving the peak and using parallel to create density. I tried both ways, but still left me with the issue of not being able to crank it louder without messing things up. With the dense drum samples, the rest of the mix would start choking every time the drums hit. Generally I find it so much easier to get things to compelling loudness when there\u2019s no drum instrument (I find percussive elements with higher pitches easier to fit in the mix). How can I work around this?",

The issue we keep running in to is really terrible engineering and production caked into the vocals by this very large/random span of producer (14 total songs), then the artist says that every vocal feels over compressed (I can assure you that none of it is coming from me). I've told her time and time again that perhaps these notes would have been more effective during production or recording, but it still feels like it's my fault. (also, fun tidbit: her verbage is \"the eq on the vocal feels too compressed\"). she references the mixes on very old Apple earbuds and has the most ludacris notes about the bass n stuff. I'm mixing on PMC IB1s and Airpods, FWIW. just feels like this endless uphill battle where I'm worried I'm running thin on patience.",

I think the way you explained it though was super helpful; that the boundaries were exceeded and I'm unable to continue. We actually do have a contract, but it quite literally has 1 sentence detailing the mixing responsibilities...the rest is about points on a production I finished for her over a year ago. SO WEIRD that this contract represents both things?? Anyways, the consensus I've come to is to pull out the calculator and figure out what my \"kill fee\" is for the amount of work I've done already, then subtract that from the flat fee I got upfront for mixing (7 out of 13 mixes are approved). The valuable lesson I've learned here is: A. the artist has to like their own music (I just don't think this is true with her...lots of insecurities). B. the artist has to like what I do (again I don't know where I'm going wrong, but she seems to think mixing can save a song). C. I have to like the music (I don't, and I haven't from the beginning). I think all 3 of these points are valuable before committing to a full album.",

(i'll rewatch when they post it back up)  Its this cutting / scooping of the high mids (up at c.1-6khz) that ive never heard much about before, Im interested because i dont like crushing my mixes to get a higher lufs and if this is an effective way to get their smoothly im v interested in learning more....im happiest with my mixes at -12 lufs but will push to -9 ....but id like to get to -9 with as little sacrifice to the fidelity and low end as poss.\nIve also heard recently (I think i heard it from colin leanord talking) something about the trap guys always scooping out the  second octave harmonic   of the bass ? c. the 110-130hz region....Is anyone familiar with using this? (eg.  the  \"missing fundamental\" and all that good stuff)",

I dont use compression for dynamics control either....you may have heard of the \"clip to zero\" strategy? i do a similar thing but then output my limiters/clippers at -6db instead of 0. Its similar to what johns doing just catching peaks and not squashing the life out of everythin....mike dean does it too IIRC. \n\nRe: spectral shaper : I didnt actually spot jon using his spectral shaper in that 1-6khz region, i saw it in the low mids....so having heard you and @oaklandmatt both mention it ...it seems hes defo already using this high mid scoop trick then! Ill still research the maths of the lufs algo because i like to really understand the psycho-acoustics and science of these sorts of things. Im after the ultimate mix in this life, lol .....i come from underground club music, where drums and bass and a sweet vocal are everything so its a constant balance/re-balance between lows/mids and highs as i learn more advanced techniques\n\n..re: jons mix yesterday and clipping, and you mention clipping the attack portion of a sounds adsr , did you notice how much he uses transient shapers on almost everything? v clever. Personally, i love transients and fight hard to keep them and jons trick of putting a transient shaper after a clipper/limiter has been a revelation....(thanks @oaklandmatt , that gem came from your LWMR) .....bruce swedien said compression is for children, and i believe he evangelised about not killing transients ...i love a transient shaper and a clipper ....compressor , not so much.",

It is smart, and for his workflow it\u2019s also fast and easy.\n\nI use compressors a lot, but I\u2019m also working in mostly indie rock with acoustic drums and bass guitars not 808\u2019s and drum machines, which is a drastically different world. I also think I\u2019m doing what most people don\u2019t do and I don\u2019t always love the artifacts of compression so I generally use slow attacks to maintain transients and fast releases to recover quickly (I adjust so that I get the fastest release before audible distortion)\n\nBTW Bruce Swedien while he may have evangelized not using compression don\u2019t underestimate that his greatest works were done to tape and even when you were conservative and didn\u2019t hit tape hard, the transformers going into tape and out of and the tape as a medium itself would peak limit attack heavy instruments like drums",

It can be beautiful guitar ballads with lots of stacks, or it can be insane berzerk bass with crazy vocal effects. Brevin Kim is a duo that embody that balance very well. \n\nIn the way it\u2019s create, hyperpop borrows from and feels reminiscent of the punk days because of how connected it is to modern cultural movements (hyper pop is deeply tied to LGBTQ+ culture), so many of these kids don\u2019t care about things like if the master redlines or there\u2019s masking\u2014if that\u2019s what gets their energy across, they\u2019ll want that in the mix.",

I\u2019ve just gotten too many sessions from people where there is so much bussing and subgrouping going on that by the time the vocal gets to the mix bus, it is passed through 3 instances off gullfoss and 4 different compressors and there is zero life in it. It quickly gets out of control. I actually find minimal bussing to be a quicker workflow because I don\u2019t have to follow a whole series of subgroups to know the entire processing chain on a given audio source when I\u2019m trying to make a tweak, nor will that tweak affect any other element that is sitting just fine.

    "content": "@Gazing Wrmth | Mixes & Masters I\u2019m pretty much exclusively in cans and i second all of what Noah said. Additionally, sonarworks for your headphones is definitely worth it esp. for only 70 USD. It will smear transients a bit, but you can get over that if you reference well. Mix quiet and you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nForgot to mention, because DT 770s are closed back, making sure you have a good seal and taking breaks are critical. You need a 15 minute break for every hour you put in on cans, bare minimum IMO. Without that, attention loss and fatigue kick in. \n\nTools like tonal balance control 2 are important. I recommend setting up a Pro-MB with 3-5 bands across the entire frequency range but make them all neutral with no compression. Sub, low, mid, high mid, top end. You can monitor specific ranges now. And for sub/low end, you can turn the gain up on your headphone mix a bit, isolate the low end, and you can hear it a bit better. Make sure you turn your headphones down a bit before you un-solo the low or the sub, but this has helped me massively",

Also I\u2019ve had good luck taking that pitch envelope sine or triangle and throwing a volume shaper (I use Devious Machines Duck) and sidechain that to the kick in mic, play with the shape so that it doesn\u2019t interact with the transient, or print the whole thing to audio and play around with the timing so your sub is slightly behind the beat so your kick transient can still remain clear and your sub can bloom behind the transient.

This most recent time I started sending things out, I noticed the center really get mangled. Specifically the kick and snare. Im wondering if sending out a stereo mix of the drums is just ruining the center image of the kit. The bass and vocals go out with a mono switch engaged so they are sitting fine. I prefer the solidness of the ITB mix at the moment. If anyone has gone down the rabbit hole of this and has some thoughts would love to hear it.

I found it interesting that the conversation began with discussions around giving the market what it wants, status, feelings of entitlement but then ended in the territory of everything is subjective and if it sounds good it's good.\n\nExpanding on the entitlement piece: I see two camps. Those who have had success in the industry, but the headwinds are changing and they  fear going the way of the dodo. Sentiment being 'i ought to be able to keep doing what I was doing that worked for me before'. And then folks who want to make the best art they can by following their own unique taste / vision, charting a new path, who are disappointed when the market doesn't reward them enough for it.\n\nHow do we reconcile giving the market what it wants with everything is subjective / if it sounds good it is good?",

Or if the other instruments are doing things that aren\u2019t meaningful to the arrangement, it can get contribute to bass notes getting lost as well. \nTry muting other stuff one at a time until you can hear the bass well, and evaluate why the bass isn\u2019t cutting through. \n\nSometimes, you just gotta zoom out and mute the bass and mix the song without the bass and put it in. Before you do this, save as and solo vocals (if there is any) bass and drums (sometimes one other most important/prominent element in the arrangement on top of that) and make that work first. You can get it to a point of making the mix work this way if there is one element that just doesn\u2019t sit well in the mix.",

It's a female voice which is quite delicate.  I need to honour the sound of the room it was recorded in and so far use of Microshift and eventide harmonizer aren't doing it.  I'll get there somehow, if I had alt takes i'd probably construct some kind of ghost double  and treat that, but I'm interested to see what you are doing in this situation?  The song arrangements are so stark - no bass or drums, so there's nowhere to hide!",

    "content": "Along with others suggestions , I would advise some easy quick  tools to help you diagnose  . Izotope insight has a very good spectrograph that clearly reveals what\u2019s happening down at 20-30 hz and how much energy is there . We ve also discussed izotope tonal balance here as well , but it\u2019s really a very handy diagnostic when used to investigate where your low end energy is against a referenced track you like . Izotope Match eq is another tool that again allows you to compare and contrast what\u2019s happening in your low end . I\u2019ve also found the Shawn Everett trick mentioned here , useful for investigating low end (put a brick wall low pass filter on your mixbus and sweep it down to the 20-30hz with your subs on and see what that actually sounds and feels like . The other thing I find helpful is my gain staging and buses are set up so that I know how much gr and level should be arriving at each bus , so you soon know if you\u2019re too hot just by looking at the comp / limiter . The last thing I\u2019d say is know your speakers . I apply all this to myself because translation is my main point of focus right now . I forget where I heard it said , but I heard it said that the listener hears the inverse of what we the mixers hear .",

So  as many mentioned it takes making it smaller to make it bigger again. I guess this also applies to distorted guitars",

I guess I could try limiting drums/bass together, as maybe it\u2019s a phase issue with kick and bass adding together (talking live drums here, not programmed)\u2026 but any thoughts here are appreciated. \n\nSecondly, what range of limiting (aka -2 to -6db) are you guys doing on mix bus to have your overall mix at around-9lufs? I have been trying to only hit -2db of limiting on peaks for most of my mix, but have a really tough time accomplishing this and loudness. I love heavy/punchy low end, so maybe that\u2019s why.. \n\nI guess I have this idea/goal in mind that I should be able to make -9lufs mixes that are punchy with a lot of low end, while only hitting 2db of limiting, but it seems impossible.

The VU meter to highlight how the mix is behaving pre-limiter :\nVU (Volume Unit) Meters essentially display an average of what we hear, rather than the very fast peaks that we don\u2019t. they will show you the energy in the low end, and if there is radical movement, then you probably have an issue with frequencies that you aren\u2019t hearing.VU meters should \u201cdance\u201d smoothly and in a gentle manner, usually in time with the music, rather than in big jumps and erratic, out of time movement.\u00a0 This erratic movement implies that there are drastic level changes, which will be hard to control in mastering and need addressing in the mix.  \n\n2. The LUFS meter post limiter to set your loudness levels\n\nPersonally, i dont use this MO ...i like izotope tonal balance to monitor the mix but....just wanted to share what i rememmbered about people using vu ITB",

    "content": "I use an Analog VU meter on the output of my monitor controller built by the inhouse tech who also worked at Neve (he designed and built the 8816 summing box) - he recommended the Sifam ones because their ballistics are really good - which I think is the main argument for analog vs digital. I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

I don\u2019t base everything I do on this it\u2019s just a check every now & then once I start mixing same as the clarity - it & the clarity together give me all the info I need - but very different.

I have \"corrected\" the asymmetrical waveform using phase rotation in rx. Is it common practice to use phase rotators/all-pass filters to make these waveforms more symmetrical? or do these things do more harm than good? what are your approaches to this?

    "content": "I think this is important to realize WHY this is working. The polarity flip is making the drums (as a whole) sum the waveforms in a more pleasing and additive way. \nThe way I theorize this is happening is because while all of the drum mics relative phase relationships remain the same, the frequencies that the drums produces slightly vary during a performance. These are NOT one shot samples going through the microphones. The 4 on the floor makes it much more complex because BOTH the snare and the kick are producing different tones (with variances) at the same time\u2026The frequencies that are additive (in-phase) are relative to all of the drum mics positioning/distance from the source, BUT different frequencies will add/subtract in magnitude\u2026that is what we are quickly checking with polarity. If you change the tuning on a snare drum for instance, it can start to become less \u201cin phase\u201d with the overheads because the fundamental frequency has changed and may not be complimentary between the OH/SN mics anymore at the same distance.",

I mixed the whole thing in one Pro Tools session, with a separate set of channels for each song which I\u2019d then make inactive and move onto the next song. When printing the continuous mix at the end, I\u2019d make active two songs at a time for any overlap, and constructed the long printed mix like that.\n\nIn this case though, there are multimiced drums, bass, electric guitars, keyboards, vocals. The recordings are good (from the stereo board mixes I\u2019ve heard) and the scale is such that I want to have the fidelity I\u2019d approach a studio record with, and the room to shape an identity for each song (while still sounding like they all happened on the same stage on the same night) so I\u2019m thinking to use my usual elaborate drum mix routing with parallels etc, all the bells and whistles.\n\nThis complexity would put me off mixing 23 songs in one session, but I\u2019m thinking of the inevitable crunch at the end of the project and the potential frustration of jumping between sessions.\n\nAm I thinking too deeply about this? Should I just get a drum sound and leave it there for 23 tracks, with a few rides here and there?\n\nNot much experience with this stuff so any thoughts would be very welcome please!",

    "content": "On the topic of EQ\nI'm doing some projects now that are live drums driven so to speak. I'm trying to up my game both when it comes to recording and mixing. \nMy instinct when it comes to EQ is to subtract. In a way, it feels logical to me. Let's say I don't like the sound on a snare around 400hZ. Then my brain goes - let's remove that. \nI've been digging deeper lately into the API style of EQ and it occurred to me that when going through the preset list -  most of the presets were doing additive stuff. I find this very interesting and when it comes to \"surgical sounddesign\",  a new workflow for me. Like - I don't like the low mid on this snare. Let's boost the top instead. \nIt feels somewhat backward but I can see some good things coming of it. \nHow's your workflow?",

Issue I'm having is that I'll get it dialled for one part of the song, then the key changes (it's a funk odyssey) and what was satisfying and round becomes boomy because of where I've boosted/cut in relation to fundamental/harmonics.\n\nSolution so far is to chop it up and treat each section differently, but I still don't feel like I've fully done it justice. Essentially I was hoping there'd be a EQ preset [edit - this is a joke, in case not clear] that could sort my shit out for me, but also generally interested as it's not really come across my desk before, and I know there are some funky monsters in here.\n\nGreat shouts from all though, thank you!",

(Antares or Waves or any other?). I have heard that waves autotune has a different autotune sound to it, i do have experience with antares. But would love to get waves if it is any better. \n\n2. I hear the proximity effect in the vocals, and i dont think there is any compression applied, but if you hear any let me know what type of compression/compressor she might have used to get that very  subtle effect to her vocals. \n\n3. What type of additional vocal processing you hear on this record? Let me know.",

I always do a quiet listen or a headphone city walk to see if I loose important elements in the quiet bits to make sure I don\u2019t overshoot the dynamics. Also don\u2019t get stuck in a loop of just one section for too long. Also sometimes I start the intro a little louder and slowly let the volume settle to where I actually want it in the verse if I want it to actually be a bit more dynamic\u2026 just a subtle bump of the intro guitar/piano etc then let it settle under the vocal can help it appear loud enough in a playlist off the top and still let you have some contrast from verse to chorus. I know I said two conflicting things- depends on the arrangement",

    "content": "So think of mid vs side in terms of panning left right & center, and think of EQ as volume. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got a lot of low end information on the sides, and say it\u2019s fighting with a mono bass track that\u2019s supposed to be holding down the majority of the low end, you can eq the lows out of those panned tracks, or you can blanket turn all the lows down on the sides with a m/s eq on a buss, so that the L and R info is quieter. It\u2019s basically a group volume ride for frequencies instead of tracks. You can also do this on individual stereo tracks if just panning isn\u2019t granular enough. \n\nThe why & when is mostly about taste. I tend to mix into a proQ3 setting that has the sides hi passed around 100 for the same reason I have a pultec boosting highs & lows on the master- it just ends up doing a lot of work for me.\n\nIt can become problematic if I\u2019ve got big toms in a song and, after I\u2019ve got a mix starting to cook I\u2019ll toggle it on & off to see if I\u2019m doing more harm than good. For the kind of music I mostly do, it works more often than not, but the one song I sent to Cian for mixing he basically blasted me for doing that. (In his own kind and gentle way.)\n\nBut m/s eq isn\u2019t just for the master buss. You can think about it for any stereo track. Sometimes, I have an acoustic that\u2019s carrying the whole song, but the fundamentals are fighting with the vocal, so I\u2019ll turn the mid down at that frequency (or side chain that to the vocal if it feels anemic when the vocal is out.) that leaves the sides as big as you like cause it\u2019s not fighting with my mono vocal.",

For example: say the track is build on a particular low end and when you change it the mix no longer feels correct and you find you need to re frame a few things and might need to spend quite a bit of time on it to get it to feel correct again?  Do you work on it with them in the room and re build or do you stop and say I\u2019ll send you another Version later and re group after?  The reason I ask is I generally want to spend more time on ideas than the artist, they may say yes that\u2019s great and let move on and I may want to work on it for a bit in  more detailed manner.",

I\u2019m on holiday with fam now so a little write up will need to suffice. \n\nJack\u2019s video covered a good chunk of what I\u2019m doing. Attenuating a few frequency hotspots and clicks is more than half of it. Unlike Jack, I use mouth declick far more than spectral repair or declick. \n\nThere\u2019s other things I\u2019m doing as well but they vary from song to song. I\u2019ll manually smooth out plosives, mic stand bumps, clothing rustles etc. I\u2019ve even gone through and reduced the aliasing in a processed vocal (which takes fucking forever to lasso tool). \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve never seen anyone mention before is fades in RX. It\u2019s a little hard to explain so I\u2019d have to make a video for this, but I do frequency dependent fading. If you think about it, almost all sounds decay with the high end decaying faster than the low end, so when I\u2019m fading noise floor I do the same and the result is more natural and invisible.",

    "content": "Great, we\u2019ve all kind of known that. Back to FFT, which works in a LINEAR  way. If we run a 16 \u201cband\u201d FFT on a 48 kHz signal it will divide the audio spectrum (0 Hz to 24 kHz) into 16 evenly spaced bins or bands. Each bin is 1500 Hz wide. Think about that for a second. That means we have a a single bin that contains everything from 16500 to 18000 Hz, a very \u201cnarrow\u201d slice as it pertains to musical interest. On the flip side we are left with only a single bin that represents everything from 0 Hz to 1500 Hz, a huge chunk of the music. If the whole point was to slice up this signal so we could do something interesting to it then that is often not the resolution we hoped for. \n\nI see the hands going up!! \u201cLet\u2019s just increase the number of bands to get more frequency resolution\u201d. And herein lies one of the confounding things about FFT. We are caught in a frequency domain/time domain tradeoff. The finer the bands or slices the more things blur in the time domain when we reconstitute via the iFFT (of the bands we have processed any or all bands). If no processing then you can run any length FFT and then the iFFT and perfectly reconstruct the original signal. (This is what you\u2019ll often see 16 to 48k FFT on signal meters).\n\nSo some practical examples to help you guys get a handle on this. Open a file in RX and get the spectral repair module in attenuate mode set to a strength of 1. Set bands to the lowest possible (128?), figure out how wide your bins are. Now try to do a detailed edit in the low end, you\u2019ll notice that you don\u2019t have much \u201cresolution\u201d, but up high say above 10k it\u2019s razor sharp. Now bump up your bands to the max 4096. Do the same LF edit and you\u2019ll suddenly have nice narrow frequency slices but you\u2019ll see things getting very blurry in the time domain, tight kicks become smeary whooshes",

Im using parrallels of my kick and bass to get my loudness and harmonics, pre Low End Bus . If id want more control id consider a hz-dependent side chain on the bass from the kick, but dont like how that f's with the attack of the bass. Trying to do less processing at all stages......and get there with better balancing ..... So...a tiny bit of  comp on the kick and bass buses (0.5 db slow attack, fast release...usually neutron comp) and only an eq and standard clip on the kick bass bus to only catch random peaks and not jam the final  limiter . i like a littler expansion also , playing around with the pro G expnasion mode is fun",

See, here's my thing with compression: I do like to absolutely smash my bass with compression because I like the sound of a really pinned down bass, and vocals is a given, but other than those two sources, I really don't compress. What I've found is that once I compress one thing,  I find myself going,  \"Oh, this thing needs to be brought up, and then this thing and then this thing...\" and then I end up in a \"loudness war\" with myself. I know tons of people who compress the day lights out of everything, and more power to them. Sometimes I wish I could make it work for me... I also find compression somehow takes away from the impact of things as well, in a way.",

I\u2019ll even cascade a couple of shelves sometimes if I have to go crazy, or shelve 150 and HP 50. You can get similar amounts of attenuation and the shape of the phase rotation feels a little less fake.\n\n- how much of this are you doing in solo? Often the phase fuckery bothers me in solo and doesn\u2019t as soon as the 808 is bumping. \n\n- sometimes I just let the lowend be loose and say \u201cfuck it. My mix, my aesthetic choice\u201d.

A lot of it stolen from @cian riordan and from this Discord, lots of wisdom from @Nomograph Mastering included.\n\nMinimal buss compression (1-3db on loudest sections of a mix), usually some kind of tape saturation (typically Slate Virtual Tape Machine), and Pro L2. The limiter is only grabbing 3-4 dB for the most part with the odd drum hit or whatever hitting more. Rarely I\u2019ll add in other processing to push things harder for a specific mix, but 95% of the time that\u2019s it. Then it\u2019s sub busses or processing on individual tracks to get the level and compression/limiting needed to get things slamming. Then for mastering I pull the gain on Pro L2 down 6 dB, print and call it a day.",

    "content": "TLDR: The document discusses the claims of sound quality and superiority between different audio software. It concludes that no evidence supports these claims, and any perceived differences in sound are due to variations in software algorithms, particularly in how they handle signal levels and pan groups. These differences do not indicate one software's superiority over another but rather reflect different mixes with varying balances. The document also highlights that any discrepancies caused by third-party plugin incompatibilities should not be mistaken for differences in sound quality. The concept of \"better sound\" is subjective and not quantifiable.",

As someone who is often producing and mixing as well as playing instruments, it was extremely liberating to have another person (him) responsible for listening and making judgments about the takes. A lot of his recording process involves having bands tracking together live and I think it is hard to objectively judge the energy of a full band take if you were one of the musicians who just played on it (it can be easy to focus on your instrument, part execution over feel, etc). His process speeds up the session and allows the performers to create more freely with out having to worry about judging quality at the same time  but it does require a lot of trust in him as the producer. And he is doing a very specific type of music and recording.",

    "content": "I can't speak to the mixing aspect of it (I only master), but a few points I've found helpful:\n\nI use notion, but any type of board thing would be fine -- colums for \"confirmed/files here\", \"sent\", \"revisions needed\", \"alts needed\" (after approval usually), etc etc have helped. Trello or Notion allows you to keep any notes in the actual card itself, which may be helpful with management or more people involved. I have a separate Notion board for potential projects until files are in, then they go in the \"actual\" project tracker.\n\nFor the multiple messaging fronts...I use texts.com. All messaging apps in one place (email included, though you can't reply there) in an iMessage like format. I know @Nomograph Mastering has concerns about anything like that in regards to security, but I've looked into it and it seems very secure for where I'm at (anything sensitive I am password protecting files, etc as well).\n\nAs far as revisions, I'm sure most of us try to keep it as timely as possible. Normally I try to do it ASAP, same day or next day latest. And as you know, when you are busy revisions are a very real thing to consider, especially if your number of projects is high. I do revisions very fast -- take the note, implement it, send. For instance just yesterday was sailing along...BOOM. Revision from something two months ago. If you're working on hundred+ projects a month that's just the norm, even if 90 percent get approved first pass. Gotta be able to roll on that very fast, people really appreciate it (I know you know this, saying for others here too). Which requires good tracking, session management, etc etc.\n\nThe real trick is handing the very difficult revision processes where people go down rabbit holes, doing whatever is required for the result there but not letting it destroy the schedule. It can be tough.\n\nAll that said, I definitely have pain points I'm working on (being slow invoicing as one, sometimes there just aren't enough hours in the day)",

Kinda like when I turn on oversampling on a limiter or clipper, where you get less peaky distortion. While that is great on the other hand what I notice is that transients get less \u201cvisceral\u201d, like putting over a blanket or something (really hard to discribe I find). How do you guys feel about that? I\u2019m honestly a bit lost with how I want to approach it, cause I see the benefits but also I\u2019m not sure about the trade offs",

This happens to me from time to time, not always that extreme tho.\n\nGenerally my first move is to listen while bypassing each thing and trying to identify what it\u2019s making better and what gets worse, then if I decide to try and keep some of them I\u2019ll attempt to move some of those plugs off the main mix buss and back onto a subgroup or instrumental buss. But no matter what it ends up with me looping sections and rebuilding the mix to match the rough vibe before I get into the actual creative fun part of the mix.\n\nI have one producer i work with often who mixes into a comp on his all vocal buss and it\u2019s slow and hitting like 3-6 db compression. It totally bones me while mixing so I usually end up rebalancing all the vocals section by section to match his mix before I \u201cstart mixing\u201d. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll just work into their buss shit and bypass the stuff/bands of each of plug that are only hurting and not helping. \n\nReal can of worms tbh. \n\nLast week I ran into the vocal buss issue- luckily it was a comp w side chain input so I did try out the sidechain, I pre fader sent all the tracks feeding it while copying automation to that send, then used a master fader to match the buss sc level to the original comps gain reduction  and it worked well in that situation and untied my hands while saving me from a whole vocal rebalance session. First time that approach ever actually worked though for me tbh. If its a comp that drums are driving into i find the sc input doesnt end up feeling the same usually.",

The artist allows me to mix the instrumental i produce, and i am aware that i need to take the limiter off when sending these files out for mastering.  \n\nTo be honest, i'm not understanding the external sidechain part you're talking about. Maybe i'm not experienced enough \ud83d\ude26 I mostly use sidechain for bass/808 and instruments and the input would be the kick. I haven't try sidechain for other any purpose than that ever.

    "content": "All good it\u2019s a little tricky at first and just really difficult to explain typed out for me.\n\nSame concept as using a sidechain input from a kick drum to duck the 808 - an external sidechain allows us to give the compressor something to listen to and apply the compression from that source to another source.  When the kick is fed to a compressor on your 808 channel - the compressor \u201clistens\u201d to the kick and applies the compression curve from the kick onto the bass.\n\nSo in your case of printing stems with a mix bus compressor - you want the SPL Iron plugin to \u201clisten\u201d to the entire mix as it heard it before but then apply that compression to one track at a time.\n\nWe can do this in Ableton with some clever workarounds, which would be a lot more efficient to show you on a video call on the server if you are free later.  Essentially you need to print a version of your song at each point in your mix bus chain where there are dynamics plugins (just before the Slate plugin, just before the Iron Compressor but after all the other plugins) and then send that audio to those corresponding plugins\u2019 external sidechain inputs and then you can use the \u201cinclude return and master effects\u201d and get the result you are looking for",

When I pulled it up at first I thought it looked a strange setting as I\u2019m used to focusing an mb more on containing any remaining  low end as opposed to the mid bands . Where the pop vocal is going after the mids mostly . And it\u2019s actually awesome how it\u2019s setting  the vocal in the mix . It\u2019s become a default for the mixes im doing at the moment. Good looking out man , thanks",

The point Josh makes here in regard to being careful of the time / phase relationships of drum multitracks between close and middle distance / room mics (due to distance travelled of the signal to each mic )  is pertinent to where I\u2019m at at the moment. I\u2019d seen jacquire king discussing how he\u2019s looking to have his transients on his drums and bass all hitting on the positive phase of the signal so he can insure he has his signals  pushing and pulling the speakers in unison and not trying to push and pull at the same time . I\u2019m still wondering how I can really achieve this if I\u2019m allowing a few milliseconds phase delay between my kick close mics on the multi track .",

Me - I only consistently find it useful in two places. 1: Vocals as essentially a volume leveler. 2: Bass - For whatever reason, I really like the sound a very \"pinned down\" bass. Other than that, I haven't found compression very helpful. I'm always hearing of people going crazy with it and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out?? - Especially with drums?? I can see what it's doing when I apply it - to the drums - but I just don't find that I ever produce a very helpful or flattering result... And golly - A little while back I was working on one of my songs with a mixer whom I hold in VERY high regard. He was guiding me through my mix with his methods - Basically using parallel compression on everything, and I remember distinctly feeling several times as though my \"hands were tied\" - The session felt very \"stiff\" with all that going on. Anyway... Thanks.",

Right now I'm looking to do it on an 808. Trying Live's Utility Width parameter, Bass Mono parameter and Ozone Imager. All souding ok, just curious what people use. Have a good weekend !",

The question becomes the trade off in loudness vs the mix suffering (which is a bit subjective)\n\nOn the other hand\u2026\nMost services default to roughly level matching songs to their target LUFS which is where the extremely misguided \u201cloudness penalty\u201d idea came from. BUT when services level matching different songs, sometimes you can get away with more dynamic range.\n\nI typically do not worry at all about what number I\u2019m hitting once a mix is feeling great.

Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a drum kit, stereo acoustics, bass etc. I\u2019m struggling to maintain a solid and clear kit that doesn\u2019t get in the way of a vocal in something like a country genre for example. \n\nIf I want the snare good and bright and present but not seem like it\u2019s at the same plane of the vocals. Transient control, room ambience, obviously pure level? \n\nAny thoughts on this? I suppose I\u2019m talking about front to back depth but without making it seem too obvious. I see some guys using compression over the instrument buss that\u2019s grabbing the instruments and holding them at a certain level and letting the vocal Poke above. I\u2019d imagine this contrast in attacks would create that separation. \n\nAnother example might be having a tambourine or shaker that inherently have a bright and transient nature that is also able to appear as if it\u2019s not up front.",

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering \n\nThere\u2019s so many layers to this conversation. \n\nOne layer is: *are methods of reframing what you\u2019re hearing inherently a crutch for poor monitoring?*\n\nThe 400hz high pass that you monitor through part time on every master would imply not. \n\nAs someone with pretty good monitoring (80% of a Gerhard room and MUM 8s), I personally still find these kind of things very useful within a mixing context. \n\nI think you\u2019re imagining a whackamole scenario of revolving bandpasses throughout the process and repeatedly throwing off the brain\u2019s fr curve, when in reality it\u2019s a once per mix check at the 85% mark that takes about 5 minutes total to see if anything that\u2019s been overlooked jumps out when adjacent information isn\u2019t distracting from it.\n\nThe way this helps me hone in on relationships between elements that I\u2019ve been neglecting is pretty significant. I lean heavily \u201cvocal > everything\u201d when I mix, and nearly every time I do this bandpassing reframe I notice something I\u2019d missed in the interplay between the rest of the elements and the whole project is upgraded as a result. \n\nI think it\u2019s totally fair to warn against the pitfalls of such maneuvers in the same way that it\u2019s fair to warn against abusing energy drinks, but when it\u2019s just once a week before an intense workout, an energy drink is actually a big win with little to no downside.",

Then I drive it through the free TSC 808 plugin for further emphasize the harmonics the bluey brings out. (EQ too)\n- Then, I use Audreio on the master to play the mix through my phone instead of my monitors. Once on the phone, you can blend the parallel with the bass in a way where there\u2019s little to no audible difference on a monitor, but the illusion of a bass can be heard through the harmonics playing on the phone.\n- It\u2019s a balancing act, but there\u2019s almost always a nice sweet spot to be found where it doesn\u2019t change the quality of the sound enough to be intrusively perceived on HD speakers, while giving life to the bass on lesser speakers.\n\nThis has helped my bass translate to more systems, and is the only time I find myself wanting to use the CLA76.",

    "content": "@Juliette Ok having heard the track, there\u2019s a solo synth bass in there which is well designed sonically, when that drops out and the bass guitar comes back in, everything from about 60-70 cycles and below disappears except for the kick. So yeah I\u2019d first try pumping low end into it, be it with EQ or subharmonic, followed by some (a lot) of compression. I\u2019m sure better people here have a better way to do this. \n\nThe DI itself doesn\u2019t have any overtones other than stuff you\u2019re finding unflattering, so you could try mult\u2019ing the DI signal out to an amp sim (even some guitar amps work here) to fill out the spectrum that the guitars aren\u2019t fulfilling \n\nI\u2019d also say the bass drum could use some augmenting of the low end  and maybe a bit of length in order to emphasise that impact. Because the synth bass atm has all the power, and isn\u2019t omnipresent, so it\u2019s leaving the rest of the arrangement even _more_ neutered as a result",

The second harmonic is often louder than the fundamental, and any midrange available is just kind of clicky finger transient stuff. \n\nI've used RX to reduce the second harmonic to a more natural level (note by note), but the bass just still feels dark & doesn't cut on small speakers.\n\nRe-recording the original player isn't an option, unfortunately. Are there any hive-mind suggestions to get more midrange character from a dark bass recording?",

As I said, a lot is about simple volume shaping, but that doesn\u2019t always give me what I\u2019m after. For example, how that octave layer trick translates to kicks. If I have a kick that I want to feel snappier on top, could I duplicate it and pitch it up an octave, or would that mess with the mid/low end? Or is it more about lifting the top with EQ to bring the transient forward? That always feels a bit strange when it\u2019s pushed too hard, so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right approach either. Just curious how pro mix engineers handle it.",

Low end is fine (everything non-kick is high-passed), but the top end is where my kick transient sometimes gets masked by loops/percs. That\u2019s why I mentioned the tiny time-offset thing, not big shifts, just few ms to see if it helps the transient poke through without messing up the groove @thegreatcarsoni. Not sure if that\u2019s considered bad practice, but sometimes it feels like it helps.",

These artifacts are unable to be heard unless I have a low pass filter active but I theorize that they, along with the extreme compression subconsciously degrade the listening experience by discretely assaulting your ears to the point of needing to take a break from listening. \n\nMy music can be related sonically to clara la sans \u201canother night\u201d give or take more or less busy. (Keep in mind her stuff is cranked to the point of audible artifacts sitting around -7ish lufs integrated across the chorus).\n\nI arrange the mix well and leave 1db of headroom for summing on individual instruments whilst they are loud enough for my target of -10 LUFi across the chorus, meaning my mix is actually 1db louder than -10 with space to sum on the pre master bus. Leaving headroom means I can introduce less artifacts at the cost of having to squeeze the dynamic range of individual instruments more than otherwise.\n\nMy issue is that If I want to aim for let\u2019s say -8LUFSi across the chorus in a relatively clean way with minimal artifacts, I\u2019m forced to squeeze the mix to -7.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear y\u2019all thoughts on whether or not technically inaudible artifacts/distortion matter and whether or not it\u2019s really worth for me to squeeze my mix 2db more in the name of competitive loudness?\n\nPs.
