Any clown (not referring to you) can find out from Colt Copernicus on YouTube how to widen their mix\u2026 the thing to me that sets the pros apart is knowing if it should be done. \n\nRuairi talks a lot about mastering engineers giving the artist and label confidence that the record is DONE, cause it\u2019s gone through his hands. It\u2019s not just that Ruairi has great ears, he knows what those ears are supposed to be listening for. (I remember this idea crystallized a bit for me when Noah mentioned when we did a song together I was looking to achieve things in the vocal that he hadn\u2019t even considered yet, rather than us just agreeing if it needs 5k). I send songs to Cian not because I want to make sure it still holds up on his garbage speakers, but because I want his input on whether we were right to have the vocals out front or the drums destroyed or whatever. And I feel like he has the confidence to (gently) suggest that maybe we missed the forest for the trees in 3 months of production and THIS keyboard line should be the thing that carries the chorus.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the wider conversation of what are we trying to bring to the table? Do we want to just do whatever we can to have our name on as many things as possible, or do we want to be the kind of artist/producer/mixer whose involvement actually matters, even if that j evolvement is \u201cyeah, you got it mostly right, just bumped up 60hz a bit not because I\u2019m lazy but because I genuinely think the rough works\u201d",

Yours sounds huge.\u201d\n\n\nBasically what I did, besides level & panning, was carve out a bunch of like 400 in all harmonic elements. All the tracks sounded good, but the density was all bunched up down in that range. \n\nAs I was explaining it to him, I had a moment of clarity about headroom. Doesn\u2019t matter if all frequencies are present for a big and tall mix, if all the headroom is getting eaten up by everything hitting the same frequencies, the collective volume of that is gonna make everything else feel quieter. \n\nI usually think of headroom in regard to low end and transients, but it\u2019s true for every part of a mix.",

Recently I've had a bad habit of keeping them full-width.\n\nI've found that it really helps my soundstage if I don't let the long verbs touch the far-left or far-right of my mix. The more I narrow my verbs the deeper it feels like my sound stage will go. Like a vanishing point on the horizon. It also opens up a lot more sonic real-estate because now elements that are panned don't have to compete with a wide reverb wash.\n\nKeeping those big verbs away from the extreme edges of my soundstage also creates contrast against my hard-panned elements and make them feel more forward.",

I have a feeling you know all this tho- and what you actually need is perspective\u2026 either time away or listening with someone else in the room to reveal where the issues are, and the solutions that come with. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have time or people you trust to help get that perspective, try muting shit in the verses or interludes or choruses or posts, see what you can & can\u2019t live without. If every part matters, than saving the very top & bottom for the choruses is a good move. \nI was always focused on stereo field, but going taller on the choruses is also on my Must list. \n\nAnd finally, detailing moments is truly where my heart is- so I love figuring out how to make every element that leads to the downbeat create the feeling of pregnant inevitably. Sometimes a super modded verb throw or a reverse that mutes right before the downbeat\u2026 somehow making things fall apart like a nude descending the staircase, then snap back together for the next downbeat\u2026 \nAssuming you\u2019re mixing your own productions, the world\u2019s your oyster.

To go one step further on the controls for a beginner- If you are using eq, that implies that you have already diagnosed a problem, which you'll be solving with eq. When you think of that problem, what words do you use? (i.e., this is way too dark, this needs a little more highs, that frequency hurts, etc.). \nIf you find yourself talking about broader things like \"highs\" or \"lows\", that probably indicates a wide Q is appropriate. If you find yourself talking about \"that ringing\" or \"the fundamental\", that probably indicates a narrow Q is appropriate. \n\nFrequency, Bandwidth (Q), and Gain are all balance elements, as eq is a tool for balancing frequencies with one another. I'd avoid using the key of the song or phase when considering eq choices as a beginner. Just train and trust your ears.\n\nA tool that can be helpful in training your ears for EQ usage is \"Blindfold EQ\" by Audiothing (https://www.audiothing.net/effects/blindfold-eq/), which is a free EQ plugin with no numbers or indicators for the controls.",

You can create a lot of space in your mix by reducing all but a few key elements to mono. Keyboards and synths are a huge offender here.\n\nA lot of mixers/producers assume that the instruments need to be stereo, when in fact it's the *mix* that should be stereo. And the most \"stereo\" mix is often created by panning mono instruments in the stereo field. Getting those pan balances right is going to remove a lot of conflict between instruments sharing similar frequency ranges.\n\nYou can still have stereo reverbs and echoes, but they can often be far more narrow than the default setting of 100% width.

This lets you place the instrument in the stereo field of the reverb. Doing it with mondo mod allows you to keep it static but also automate movement (small or large) within the verb \ud83d\ude42\n\nAnother idea:\nUse Waves StudioVerse (or similar plugin that allows this routing)\n-parallel split the dry/wet \n-wet gets what ever verb you want\n-Leave the wet panned out-wide\n-pan the dry in towards the middle \n\nDoing it with StudioVerse allows you to avoid making aux-sends and keep it all on the track level. (Very useful on bgvs)\n\nLast idea:\nUse a pan control plugin (S1, TrackControl, etc) after the verb so you can make it more mono if you want. \n\nI love verb/dly haha thanks for letting me talk  about it here\u2026my wife is tired of hearing about it \ud83e\udd72",

I mix banjo a lot (country music,) and I\u2019ve got a couple thoughts that might be helpful if you\u2019re not already finished. \n1) choose the top carefully. Where the \u201cbrightness\u201d of the track is changes so much of how it\u2019s perceived in the track. Chances are the top end is actually much lower than you\u2019d expect. \n2) try compressing the shit out of it. Squash it allll to hell, kill the dynamics, RUIN the performance. There\u2019s a good chance if it\u2019s performed well it\u2019ll turn into a punchy percussive element that adds size and excitement. \n3) make sure it\u2019s balanced with another instrument on the other side of the the stereo field. If you don\u2019t have one that\u2019s playing something similar or has a similar top end, give it the old mono-verb/delay and see if that helps balance and keep it from being too distracting.\nHope that helps!",

In this situation you can\u2019t get to the vocal because you don\u2019t have the track, BUT if you\u2019re mixing, you can reach for the vocal and boost a narrow Q at 1500hz to accomplish the same task but in a cleaner way.\n\nThis is the type of reason I might reach for M/S, I don\u2019t reach for M/S if guitars need to be brighter on the sides, I find the guitars on the sides in my mix, and make them brighter.\n\nThis is also the same reason to argue against multiple bus processing, because if the ability to use such a processor is there, we will use it, take away a bus and we have to work harder to get the mix done, but the end result can be much more effective, impactful, dynamic, and inspiring, but it takes longer and requires a lot more finesse.",

You can get a lot of cool subtle movement. That can fill in the audio spectrum nicely. As example above could use subtle movement to fill out a pad. Or there are more adventurous circular 3D panning options that I find work well top end arps or vox chops. It was an idea born out of how people use 1/8 ping pong delays to fill out behind Bass guitar. Basically a different way to have the audio swim around subtly behind the main source. Try it. It's fun",

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering  Thank you ruairi . I appreciate it . Starting with the vocal is actually a very pertinent point for me . \nFor this body of work I\u2019m going  through currently the vocals are all tracked to a 2track instrumental but  with most of the songs  I\u2019m importing all the instrumental multitracks  into a new alternative of the mix and ditching the stereo instrumental , much for the reason you\u2019ve pointed to there . \nThe balance of the instrumental sounds excellent to itself but once you start mixing the vocals , they really need a re balance of the instrumental mix elements to allow space . So this has had me listening to the vocal alone first at length and then bringing back the instrumental elements very much around it. I was thinking yesterday how remarkably different a balance was needed to give the vocal its place.  It feels like trying to matchmake two friends who are going to be great together if you can just find the right setup , \nMain weapons (of love ) have been faders , panning and gentle eq . All of which I learnt how to harness their true power here . I\u2019m back at it again this morning and feel great about the challenge again and do love these songs . The artists are telling true stories and speaking their truth in them and that\u2019s what drives me to excel with a project \n\n\nThere\u2019s also an addictive joy and fear dynamic here atm as I continue my ever deepening realisation that there is no perfect mix to find and attach myself to ! \n\nI have to remain open for the \u201cfeeling \u201c right ? Ha ha . This is Some mystical stuff we engage ourselves in I swear \n\nThanks Ruari , best wishes",

This is an inviolable math law we can\u2019t get around. \n\nHow many bands the FFT is using has big implications for this, because the more bands there are, the more narrow the frequency impact can be, which means the wider the time impact has to be. \n\nYou can make what looks like a very short selection in the time domain in RX, but if the FFT selection is set to the maximum amount of bands, you\u2019re going to be effecting a ton of information to the left and right of your selection. Similarly, you can select just one narrow frequency but if you have the minimum amount of bands selected you\u2019ll be turning down a whole bell the size of a half an octave",

I recently wrapped up a slightly unusual 3 year \"experiment\" on myself.\n\nFor various reasons, I decided to narrow down variability in my life and rely heavily on routines. It wasn't scientific at all - the journals wouldn't touch it - but I set up a structured life with the same waking and bedtimes each weekday, similar exercise routines, identical breakfast every weekday at 8am (quantities measured), the same salad (Greek, since you asked) every weekday at 1pm for 18 months (then I switched to a tuna salad I liked and stuck with that for 20 consecutive months), and one of four batch cooked dinners at 6:30pm that I would rotate roughly weekly.\n\n[I've started typing this and I'm realising I'd need to spend far more time than I have right now to demonstrate the depth of my findings and their Nobel prize eligibility, so I'm just going to wrap it up semi-flippantly]\n\nSome takeaways:\n- When stuff started sounding bad to me like clockwork at 3:50pm every day, I knew it that it was not the mix turning sour - it was just time to eat my 4pm apple. The sugar would kick in, and hey presto, we're back in vibe town. Removing variables can be helpful in diagnosing issues - the diagnostic problem solving approach one develops as a studio assistant can, to an extent, be applied to ones self.\n\n- Limiting variety mitigates decision fatigue and frees up quite a lot of brain power. I like to think of myself as a less dead Steve Jobs - he wore polo necks, I ate greek salads. We both got a lot done.",

(Do the mic distances cause flamming?? You might have to move the rooms forward and then check polarity\u2026things like that.\n\nOne last thought that I have had a lot of success with, you can START with nothing but samples (kick/sn) and find/make the perfect fit samples and then blend them in. It takes some experimenting based on what blend of mics and picture you want to create but it can work great! Especially if the close mics are not great.",

If you\u2019re missing brilliance, try raising the guitar or leaning left or right a little\u2026 it\u2019s really about your instrument and your room and which mics you\u2019ve got. \n\nHonestly x/y should be an easy way of getting the full guitar captured.",

If you\u2019re gonna go for the modern sound but still record acoustic instruments, tweezing out nasty resonances with EQ plays a big role\u2014no way they could do that with 1073s.

The first song we mixed was 'The Laughing Man' and that really set the tone for the rest of the record, even the more up-tempo jams.

These are related ideas but not the same.\n\nBecause people can create and put out music quickly, there is a lot more competition for making everything happen quickly, even for major labels. They are trying to compete with the overall speed of content output. This means that the length of time people have to live with mixes and masters is much shorter. So people miss things more easily.\n\nThis speed affects quality control as described, but there is another aspect. Because the number of people who can produce mix and master records has increased dramatically, that narrow funnel of sonic gate keepers no longer exists. There are probably 100x or 1000x as many capable mixers than there were 20 years. Same with producers, songwriters, artists, whatever.\n\nPhilosophically, I love this. But of course, the quality of recordings now varies much more than it used to.",

It\u2019s basically a group volume ride for frequencies instead of tracks. You can also do this on individual stereo tracks if just panning isn\u2019t granular enough. \n\nThe why & when is mostly about taste. I tend to mix into a proQ3 setting that has the sides hi passed around 100 for the same reason I have a pultec boosting highs & lows on the master- it just ends up doing a lot of work for me.\n\nIt can become problematic if I\u2019ve got big toms in a song and, after I\u2019ve got a mix starting to cook I\u2019ll toggle it on & off to see if I\u2019m doing more harm than good. For the kind of music I mostly do, it works more often than not, but the one song I sent to Cian for mixing he basically blasted me for doing that. (In his own kind and gentle way.)\n\nBut m/s eq isn\u2019t just for the master buss. You can think about it for any stereo track. Sometimes, I have an acoustic that\u2019s carrying the whole song, but the fundamentals are fighting with the vocal, so I\u2019ll turn the mid down at that frequency (or side chain that to the vocal if it feels anemic when the vocal is out.) that leaves the sides as big as you like cause it\u2019s not fighting with my mono vocal.",

I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re really the final arbiter of what constitutes bringing real value to a project anyhow.

One of them said he was a fan of my work and to just \u201cdo my thing and go crazy\u201d on his half of the album. The other responded to my first passes on his tunes with something like, \u201cI\u2019ve actually worked with some really great (read: bigger) mixers who just made things a *little* deeper and wider\u201d (read: so I\u2019m not sure why *you\u2019re* doing more than that\u2026). My initial thought was that maybe his tunes should go straight to mastering? But both of these producers, and the artist and team, felt confident that someone should mix the entire project \u2013 and that there needn\u2019t be, say, a sliding scale in the rate for different songs. In those sorts of scenarios, I do think mixers can bring a good deal of value just by making everyone on the project happy and being agreeable about it.

I've noticed lately, that when I go God Particle to Fabfilter L2, the sides of the music push out significantly more. I've been getting more clarity in the instrumentation of my mixes. The compromise is less saturation, but I think I like the separation (the fabfilter or Ozone limiter was only ever doing 1-2dB of work, but still completely changing that final spectrum. I'm having trouble telling how soon my mixes overload with the Pro L-2 unfortunately. Do you think wider is better? or is a trick and it's too wide, and all that width is overload? I have trouble detecting overload in my Insight2 Plugin, I only notice it on phone speakers after the fact. any advice to help decide?",

    "content": "Great, we\u2019ve all kind of known that. Back to FFT, which works in a LINEAR  way. If we run a 16 \u201cband\u201d FFT on a 48 kHz signal it will divide the audio spectrum (0 Hz to 24 kHz) into 16 evenly spaced bins or bands. Each bin is 1500 Hz wide. Think about that for a second. That means we have a a single bin that contains everything from 16500 to 18000 Hz, a very \u201cnarrow\u201d slice as it pertains to musical interest. On the flip side we are left with only a single bin that represents everything from 0 Hz to 1500 Hz, a huge chunk of the music. If the whole point was to slice up this signal so we could do something interesting to it then that is often not the resolution we hoped for. \n\nI see the hands going up!! \u201cLet\u2019s just increase the number of bands to get more frequency resolution\u201d. And herein lies one of the confounding things about FFT. We are caught in a frequency domain/time domain tradeoff. The finer the bands or slices the more things blur in the time domain when we reconstitute via the iFFT (of the bands we have processed any or all bands). If no processing then you can run any length FFT and then the iFFT and perfectly reconstruct the original signal. (This is what you\u2019ll often see 16 to 48k FFT on signal meters).\n\nSo some practical examples to help you guys get a handle on this. Open a file in RX and get the spectral repair module in attenuate mode set to a strength of 1. Set bands to the lowest possible (128?), figure out how wide your bins are. Now try to do a detailed edit in the low end, you\u2019ll notice that you don\u2019t have much \u201cresolution\u201d, but up high say above 10k it\u2019s razor sharp. Now bump up your bands to the max 4096. Do the same LF edit and you\u2019ll suddenly have nice narrow frequency slices but you\u2019ll see things getting very blurry in the time domain, tight kicks become smeary whooshes",

(Or it's nothing having to do with EQ at all, haha)\n\nA really swell example I like to use is Sabrina Carpenter's vocals on \"Don't Smile\". There's very huge, wide reverb going on within the vocal chain and it creates such a warm, dreamy soundscape. It almost sounds like the instrumentals were all pulled back, but the vocals were still glued in there very nicely.",
