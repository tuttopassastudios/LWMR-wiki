Some of us here have spent a good deal of time and invested a lot of knowledge into this community; it's a good feeling to know that the majority opinion is one that aligns with the spirit of @oaklandmatt's original foray into live-streaming with Jon. A lot of our work happens in the shadows and often goes unappreciated, but I sleep better at night knowing you guys are also out there -- in the weeds -- trying to set higher standards for both the creation and the consumption of music across the genres. Not everyone will get it and I think that's OK. We should do our best to be kind and welcoming to people walking into a now, 2+ year-old water-cooler chat, but we shouldn't also lower the bar that we've set for ourselves as record-makers (and thinkers). This place really is special, here's to many more years of community.",

    "content": "@Zack Hames On second look, this comes off kind of jerk-ey and I didn't meant to just brush off your quest for saturation dominance! I guess what I meant to say is that through the dozens of interviews with Jon and Matt, it's clear that he's averse to using compressors and tends to use saturators more to do the job. While I fuckin' LOVE me some saturators, I honestly don't see the two as interchangeable... they're just two very different tools. One is leveling volume and the other is distorting a waveform to generate harmonics. I think saturators are a great next level tool for people who have wrapped their brains around compression.... but you really need some form of compression on an un-treated vocal. I feel in contemporary music, people are leaning too much on high-end saturation to get things to sound exciting and hyped. If I'm ever using saturators to distort things (which is often), I'm always trying to find some sort of un-distorted high end source to help the ears cling to clarity in the mix. Sometimes, things will distort in a way that will add this clarity -- or even manufacture it. But most of these multi-band saturators are just adding a layer of fuzz to the entire midrange up and the whole mix just ends up sounding hazy. IMO, a great example of modern hip-hop mixing is Mac Miller's Circles. The high end on that record sounds just as exciting as anything else, but it doesn't sound like everything got ran through a buzz saw (shoutout Greg Koller/Jon Brion). Just my 0.02.",

I stick it out for around 10 minutes, and when I go back I'm almost always hearing things the way I should be.\n\nAnd if I've the time, for an extra boost of awareness, when I come back from my shower I spend about 10-20 minutes just listening to music of a similar genre to what I'm working on, without changing the volume level between songs or when I go back to my DAW. When I stick to this routine I usually do my best work.\n\nI've also *really* fucked up some mixes due to attempting to get them done when I ain't hearing things right.

I think the biggest thing is making sure they really understand you're on their team and there to support their vision. If they don't truly understand that, its easy for guards to get put up and things be shot down immediately just because its not what they're used to.  That being said if im trying something radical/different on a pop mix, its at best 50/50 that I end up hitting undo and letting the idea go if they've been in the weeds on the song for a while already.",

I got frustrated because I would mimic their EQ curve and my songs wouldn't sound good. It's quite nutty how your brain starts to pick up on those certain tidbits and figure out what's poking out, what sounds good to *you*, and so on. It's such an art form.",

A lot of my bread and butter is contemporary classical/microtonal/experimental music and I'm in this world as both an engineer and often as a producer keeping track of how folks relate to the score and each other, take maps, etc. I tend to agree with some of the above that trying to chase down inharmonic relationships with EQ can make things worse, but I appreciate @LAPhill posting about bassoon/flute overtone series. @spectrummasters original question was about understanding the low mids and how they relate to EQing depending on the key; I think for me the way that understanding overtone series, tuning systems, and musical interactions in acoustic/orchestral instruments can relate to pop or rock mixing is like... Sometimes when I hear clashes between instruments playing thirds or clashes in the harmonic series and I'm trying to clear space in the mids/low mids, I do think about what instruments want to be occupying that space. So perhaps in the bassoon/flute example, I'd want the flute's fundamental to be stronger than the bassoon's first harmonic at C5, and that might look like EQing down the bassoon in the ranges of the flute's fundamentals, or in a rock mix looking at the bass's harmonics compared to where the lower range of the guitars are living. Obv instruments are moving and changing notes so none of this is surgical so much as the keys of the songs or the instruments' ranges might inform some general decisions about where to make space rather than just \"cut 300 on the bass\" or whatev",

It\u2019s like, setting up several busses you ALWAYS make, so instead of doing 100 keystrokes and commands to get your busses and FX built, two clicks and they\u2019re there for you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what genre / style / level you\u2019re working at, but I\u2019d say just keep working at it. I love recording music because you can ALWAYS do it again. Time is the only thing you have to lose. With enough time, anything is possible. \n\nThat said, looking at a frequency analyzer of a whole mix you like isn\u2019t a horrible thing to do.

But seems odd to use it as a 'room' 'space' tool as it wont really sound like a space... i dunno just my thoughts.... but then again, i like dirty verbs. If i experience a bad rub, because of a reverb, it's often an arrangement issue tbh. Never heard a song on the radio and been like, 'man that rub in the verb, they should have reset the reverb for that part!'. \n\n-I'm not hating on it, i'm sure some people will find it useful for something.

Essentially some kind of mythical median point job. This mythical job had already been prepped, with the back and forth for missing files etc already done.\n\nWe have the @futurejonaccounts of this world who can knock out 3 a day, but that\u2019s probably genre dependent. I had the opportunity to intern under Alan Moulder at the start of my career, and his average was 1.5 days per. He worked on a NIN track and a modern rock album produced by Jackknife Lee during that time. The 1.5 days was pretty consistent. He said that to this day, he wakes up in the middle of the night trying to figure out how to solve some mix problem, then comes in the next day to sort that out and wrap it up.",

I found myself having to turn up the low shelf a lot to account for how bright it is.\n\nThe level rider seemed pretty good. And the compressor gets pumpy quick, but it was alright in small doses.\n\nThe doubler felt great and the two verb options sounded excellent, but I could see them being limited because they only have a dry/wet control.\n\nOverall I like that it can act as an instant-vibe plugin for when you want to move quickly through a session. It\u2019s got zero latency, which is great and seemed very light on CPU. But it\u2019s not a fit for every style. Seemingly just for big pop stuff.",

I've worked on a lot of indie pop/rock records but would love to improve my skills in RnB, pop and hip hop mixing. If someone has some old/new stems (or multitracks) laying around I'd be super happy to use them for practice in my spare time. Will of course not share any of it anywhere.

    "content": "In my experience they are quite used ! Many TV shows in France and Europe require TV tracks or PBOs (play back orchestra) as we call them here. A lot of newer developing artists don\u2019t have budget for MDs that can prep a TV track, and aren\u2019t very good with DAW to make it out of stems. Obviously this is very genre specific to variety / pop / hip hop. Most rock, indie, folk people don\u2019t need these as these TV shows aren\u2019t really part of their promo circuit. \n\nI have been called many times to deliver a new TV track with a specific timing edit if a specific program has a maximum length of day for example 2:20m.\n\nI usually make the TV track this way:\n- instrumental\n- background vocals\n- lead vocal throws \n- maybe lead vocal in on choruses minus 5/6 dbs\n\nI have been advised by sound folks in TV / Radio not to master TV tracks. Something about loudness requirements, TV broadcast compressors and being able to mix the live vocals more easily with a less compressed and more dynamic TV track.",

I always do a quiet listen or a headphone city walk to see if I loose important elements in the quiet bits to make sure I don\u2019t overshoot the dynamics. Also don\u2019t get stuck in a loop of just one section for too long. Also sometimes I start the intro a little louder and slowly let the volume settle to where I actually want it in the verse if I want it to actually be a bit more dynamic\u2026 just a subtle bump of the intro guitar/piano etc then let it settle under the vocal can help it appear loud enough in a playlist off the top and still let you have some contrast from verse to chorus. I know I said two conflicting things- depends on the arrangement",

And I honestly struggled with that notion for a long time-- I thought, *why would someone seek out the guy who exclusively mixes melodic death metal for this folksy midwestern project?* But I realize now that almost all skills often will translate across songs and genres too",

    "content": "From my experience, if you focus it on low mids rather than harsh unpleasant frequencies while sidechaining, it can make room for the body of vocals or important instruments to cut through.\n\nA lot of the time, those resonances are the defining characteristics of each sound so side chaining even to harsh high-mid info can allow the character of a focus track to cut while limiting the stacking of those possibly harsh frequencies with other tracks. \n\nExperiment with the sidechain in mid/side unlinked and you can get more aggressive with sidechaining the lead vocal to the instrumental. In a dense pop mix, it can be a lifesaver.",

Any suggestions? Track has a lot of hyper-pop kinda elements along with breakdowns and stuff. Very all over the place and it's feeling tough to wrangle.",
