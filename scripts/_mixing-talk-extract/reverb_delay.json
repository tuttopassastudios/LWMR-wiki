He\u2019s extremely clever and has a natural punk rock approach to things. I\u2019ve watched him mix numerous times and left thinking I could never make anything sound good in that room or with that approach but he\u2019s managed to figure it out. It\u2019s not always fast or easy but it\u2019s always unique whether you like it or not. He\u2019s been a huge inspiration to me and a constant reminder that we are making art not products.  I\u2019d like to see more engineers following their own instincts and spending less time looking at what everyone else is doing.",

    "content": "shifting gears for a sec - something i've been a big fan of this year is duplicating a lead vocal and stripping back any compression / dynamic control to a secondary track with no output, then putting any reverb sends on that track instead of the main ldv. this saves pretty much any instinctual reverb automation \"throws\" and the such because the vocals natural dynamic is lighting up the reverb the same way it would in real life. it now strikes me how odd and unnatural it would sound to have a vocal hitting the reverb about as hard during soft moments as during dynamic moments. unfortunately there are many cases where this is simply not possible as i'm already starting with a heavily compressed vocal. maybe i'm late to this, but anybody else do this or something similar with success?",

Was actually thinking about how well he paces sessions when the convo about keeping artists \u201cunder control\u201d came up.\n\nHe\u2019s an amazing story teller, and has an infinite well of classics from his time with U2, Eno and Flood. He would alternate between having everyone in the room totally focused on getting their take or the part or whatever, then lift that pressure completely off with a hilarious story. Everyone would get to take a mental break, then after that pause they\u2019d be ready to go full bore again.

We\u2019ve been listening to music for so long, and even as we continue to learn the craft our ears continue to grow as well.

We were in this sweet spot after I graduated out of assisting him and before we got sick of being a room together... so I got to be a lot more hands on. The files came in *roooughhh*. Eric's response was simply \"it has to sound great, they're paying us a ton of money\"... so everyone in the studio divided and conquered... I replayed the bass and some drum stuff, Eric replayed a lot of the guitars, we both added to the background vocals. The parts were all bone headed but it made such a huge difference sonically to be working with real sounds as opposed to the demo recordings that got greenlit by the label. I think Eric ended up asking for an extra production credit and he got it -- they were just so stoked with the results, they didn't care. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2BYmmTI04I",

There also doesn\u2019t seem to be any center of that verb\u2014it\u2019s all wide, so that helps keep the vocal clear. There\u2019s a mono dark delay throw happening here and there, too, which gives some good front to back depth. \n\nAlso sounds like some compression or ducking (or however they did it) on the verb that opens up between the lyric spaces, so yet another thing that helps keep the vocal dry-but-also-wet feeling.",

I have a feeling you know all this tho- and what you actually need is perspective\u2026 either time away or listening with someone else in the room to reveal where the issues are, and the solutions that come with. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have time or people you trust to help get that perspective, try muting shit in the verses or interludes or choruses or posts, see what you can & can\u2019t live without. If every part matters, than saving the very top & bottom for the choruses is a good move. \nI was always focused on stereo field, but going taller on the choruses is also on my Must list. \n\nAnd finally, detailing moments is truly where my heart is- so I love figuring out how to make every element that leads to the downbeat create the feeling of pregnant inevitably. Sometimes a super modded verb throw or a reverse that mutes right before the downbeat\u2026 somehow making things fall apart like a nude descending the staircase, then snap back together for the next downbeat\u2026 \nAssuming you\u2019re mixing your own productions, the world\u2019s your oyster.

I\u2019ll duplicate this track (without inserts), maybe end up with 4 of them with different FX chains. It\u2019s no biggie just for a H-Delay and a vintageverb/metaflanger/ whatever.\n\nLike they mentioned on the podcast, this method encourages more experimentation for me, and also circumvents niggly things like trying to get a word to echo on the downbeat if it was sung on an offbeat - you just move the clip forward or backward in time. And if an Ess is too apparent, you can clip gain it down in the source etc.\n\nPlus once you have your verb throw set, when you in turn commit that throw, whatever it is about seeing the audio just suggests further details like having it cut abruptly on a beat, or reverse it, or fade it in, or EQ it etc.",

    "content": "theres so many ways to interpret this question. so here's my take. Mixing to me at least, is all about bringing out the intent of the record to the best of your abilities. Fx. if you are mixing a Classical record, all you aim for is probably getting something as close to being in the room as possible, and therefore fidelity. If you are mixing some new urban underground cultural music, you want to respect the grittiness as that can sometimes be part of the sound and/or culture, and you never want to remove the inherent DNA of what makes that thing exciting(even tho it might be unconventional). So in the end, it's OUR job to make the decisions on when to be rough and when to be high fidelity. It's all about what you want out of the music. For most mainstream music(aka. radio oriented) i would personally get a bit of both. Get the mix sounding somewhat exciting as to pull in the listener, but also have certain aspects be high fidelity as to make it easy to listen to. FX, in a pop record, Vocal intelligibility is super important if you want people to sing along, where are in a techno track or hyperpop track you can have some grittier vocals, as they aren't as intended to be the in the car sing along song. They would be much more about the energy and feeling. \n\nIMO theres nothing more boring than a perfect mix, where every sound is perfectly inline and has no personality that makes it memorable. \n\nThe creativity of a mix is just as, if not more important, than the technicals. Thats what those cyborgs called Mastering Engineers are for.",

    "content": "I used to do consistent audiobook work 15+ years ago to supplement studio work. It was brutal work and I hated it. RX didn\u2019t exist yet, or was in it\u2019s infancy and sounded terrible. I\u2019d record and edit, used an m930 because of the low self noise which was huge for me around the time. My editing trick was to make a 5 min room tone loop the length of the book, duplicate the dialog, strip silence one track, using the dup track as a trigger to extract silence for the other track with the room tone selected, delete the dup track. In object mode select all the audio then it\u2019s something like shift + drag to fill the gaps from strip silence with the extracted room tone. Always used beat detective to do batch cross fades. Then listen through and correct to taste. RX declick would have been a game changer back then but I did all that shit by hand, if there was a pop on a word you\u2019d aim to find a similar syllable somewhere else to replace it with. At the time I was getting paid $250/finished hour for editing and $300 for tracking which was really good considering I could edit around 1.5:1 but tracking was always closer to 3:1. Budgets started shrinking right around the advent of RX. When I started, there was always an engineer, producer and proofer in the room for tracking. All lunches paid for. After enough experience I was able to provide all three which made it pretty lucrative. But the industry changed and eventually it was just engineer and reader which put a lot of pressure on the engineer to produce and proof. The  publisher I worked with stopped paying for lunch then dropped my fee to $250/$200 then $225/$175 then $200/$150 and once it hit $175/$125 I saw the writing on the wall and vowed never to do it again. I will say it upped my Pro Tools keyboard speed tremendously and kept my studio afloat early on. The halycon days of audiobook production are long gone as far as finaces are concerned.",

It's achievable both ways.\n\nBut since you're having trouble getting your verbs to pop out in the way you want, here are a few things that will get you there. Usually a combination of these things:\n\n**1.** Turn up the verb - Simple, I know.\n**2.** Make space for the verb - Mute or EQ competing elements.\n**3.** Increase your pre-delay time to the range of 60ms - 150 ms. This \"disconnects\" your verb from the source and makes it stand out more. And this sometimes means you can turn it down and still have the clarity. \n**4.** Use an echo instead of a verb - This sometimes does the thing and takes up less space.\n**5.** Use a slap echo instead of a verb - One and done. Gives you that room-y feel without taking up a lot of space.\n**6.** EQ muddy/thick/harsh frequencies out of your verb, so that you can turn it up louder without overwhelming the mix.\n**7.** Gently apply an effect (distortion, phaser, etc) that will make it contrast and catch the ear easier.",

    "content": "this is answer might not be the most exciting.\n\nActual Separation does not come from EQ, Compression and Saturation. These are just tool to help manipulate a sound into how you want it to sound. \n\nSeparation comes from Arrangement. If you have a Piano and a Guitar playing full chords in the same octave, you'll never get good sounding separation, no matter how much you try and manipulate the sound.\nSounds are made from a fundamental and certain overtones/harmonics. If they overlap, then they overlap, even if you add a random eq boost on each sound some Freqs apart, because someone on youtube did that. (not that you can't do it, and it wont work)\nBut Instead of removing good sounding parts of a sound forcing them to fit together(whatever that even means at this point), arrange the parts so they naturally fit together with separation. This way you'll be able to act more, creatively and instinctively on how you want the sounds to sound while mixing, instead of fitting a triangle into a circle. As the good old saying says, it starts at the source, for the best results. \n\nFx, in a typical jazz band, often a Bass will play roots on 1 & 3,  a piano will of then play the root and 5th an octave above that, and a guitar could play the 3rd and 7th, and together all the instruments make big full chords while also having their own space. this way there is now plenty of room for a singer or a Sax player to do its thing and not worry to much about cutting through a dense mix.",

Room verbs and short verbs without pre delay or a small amount of pre delay are good for pushing a vocal back into the mix. And longer verbs  like halls and plates are good for adding length and if you want length and the vocal to feel forward at the same time add more pre delay.  So nothing to worry about but rather think about what you are trying to achieve with the two verbs.",

You can create a lot of space in your mix by reducing all but a few key elements to mono. Keyboards and synths are a huge offender here.\n\nA lot of mixers/producers assume that the instruments need to be stereo, when in fact it's the *mix* that should be stereo. And the most \"stereo\" mix is often created by panning mono instruments in the stereo field. Getting those pan balances right is going to remove a lot of conflict between instruments sharing similar frequency ranges.\n\nYou can still have stereo reverbs and echoes, but they can often be far more narrow than the default setting of 100% width. So don't overlook narrowing your stereo elements too.\n\nIt's amazing how much you can do with nothing but faders, pan knobs, and EQ.",

I would definitely try and avoid a chinese capsule a la Rode mics, but the mic amp is also very important. I\u2019d avoid condensers that have intense artifacts at high SPL because of their mic amp circuits(Brauner Phantom and the Neumann TLM series come to mind). It can be quite hard to find a condenser that has that vintage-U47 style body under a certain level of investment, which is why I might reach for a large-diaphragm dynamic or a ribbon(and boost highs). I\u2019d what that low-mid body to balance out the density in the high mids. But I\u2019m mostly talking about belly tenors here, with Betty female singer I would probably be fine with something with less body(like a U67-style mic) It\u2019s quite an in-depth topic I find, you can hit me in the dms if you have specific questions.",

Then vocals were recut in London and I was sent a Pro Tools session. I always cut and edit in Pro Tools, so I used this session to comp and arrange the new vocals, but then I wanted to just bring it back into ableton and blend with the existing production. So I bounced the vocal from Pro Tools dry  (no verb or delay) but with tuning and some compression and EQ. Then I used some of the demo vocal and some of the new vocal in the final mix.\n\nI'm pretty comfortable committing eq and compression on my vocals (the confidence of years of doing this... ps you should do it more, it's good for the workflow). But if I needed to go back for some reason I could go back to the Pro Tools session. I think I did go back once to remove tuning on an ad lib that was part singing, part talking. \n\nI'm getting much more comfortable mixing in ableton. The only thing that really sucks about it is that the sessions do tend to slow down when there's TONS of vocals with autotune inserts (the equivalent number of tracks and autotune instances in pro tools does not tax Pro Tools nearly in the same way). So thus far the only way that ableton really works for me to both produce and mix in is if I don't have raw vocals in there. Hence, bouncing from pro tools works best anyway.",

    "content": "Surprise surprise ima jump in with some Brauer bullshit again- zooming out of the vocal for a second, cuz I think the choices you\u2019re talking about making, when made in a vacuum, can lead you to very different places depending on what you\u2019re already hearing when you start adding vox fx. \n\nThe idea is to identify the 2 or 3 things that the brain can actually focus on at any given moment in a song as the leading roles. Song I was on the other day had horns, vocal, and occasionally gtr were leading and everything else was just supporting (either octaves of the same part, rhythmically the same, or pads on keys). So I got those 3 rocking together without worrying about every track, it was easy to identify the kind of space I needed. I wanted it in the same room as the brass, but really forward on the stage. If I\u2019d had the pads up while trying to do this I was always either too wet or too dry and couldn\u2019t find the happy place. The tl;dr is, if you\u2019re struggling to find a satisfying construction of ideas, you may be trying to treat leading and supporting parts as equally important, and you\u2019re challenging your ear to grab what\u2019s really important at that moment. \n\nAlso in Brauer\u2019s template there are a folder of verbs that everything in the session shares including vocals. So you get a sense of cohesion from that, and the vocals have their own folder of delays that are unique to them. That helps create separation.",

This lets you place the instrument in the stereo field of the reverb. Doing it with mondo mod allows you to keep it static but also automate movement (small or large) within the verb \ud83d\ude42\n\nAnother idea:\nUse Waves StudioVerse (or similar plugin that allows this routing)\n-parallel split the dry/wet \n-wet gets what ever verb you want\n-Leave the wet panned out-wide\n-pan the dry in towards the middle \n\nDoing it with StudioVerse allows you to avoid making aux-sends and keep it all on the track level. (Very useful on bgvs)\n\nLast idea:\nUse a pan control plugin (S1, TrackControl, etc) after the verb so you can make it more mono if you want. \n\nI love verb/dly haha thanks for letting me talk  about it here\u2026my wife is tired of hearing about it \ud83e\udd72",

    "content": "I like to think of it as these three terms. 1) EQ/Sauce - no predelay or barely any (sometimes I compress it to play with the shape of it too) 2) space - 50 to 80ms (or use mix of reverb with no predelay on a slap with slightly longer delay time) 3) bloom 90-200ms. I usually just put a time delay on it before reverb if I want musically timed reverb, but I personally tend not to go towards that direction very often. I\u2019m also a big throws person so mostly my main reverb that are sent to aux tracks have medium to longer predelay and throws would have shorter predelay. Sometimes it\u2019s the other way around too. I also like to make decisions based on how long I want the vocals to be closeup for before I hear the reverb kick in. Or I also print reverb sometimes and nudge it around in different parts and play with fades if I wanna get really sculpt-y with it. I do this with reverb throws (dups clips to audio tracks rather than sends) more often than send verbs.",

In theory, this emphasizes what @Zack Hames and others said\u2014good choruses shines because of contrast. Often times, if you have a build up to a chorus or a transition into it, I like to look at the \u201ceasy to undercook\u201d elements like risers/rev reverbs, beat cuts, and harmonic layers/white noise to ensure there\u2019s that layer of \u201cooo,\u201d \u201caaa,\u201d and \u201cwow\u201d. Good rev verbs/risers shouldn\u2019t just be random white noise, I find a lot of success in tuning them and then automating the tuning so the pitch rises as well. Play with that. A great beat cut on the last count before a chorus is a killer idea. Try cutting the melodic elements and leaving the bass, maybe cutting everything\u2014listen to some Neptunes era stuff for inspo, or just more Neptunes in general honestly for pop music references.",

I'll observe how that affects the feel.\n\nGoing slower will open up some space between the notes and give them a little more sense of  weight. Sometimes going too fast will make things feel cramped, or it may give it some urgency. If the song is groove-oriented this has a massive effect on the feel. Go figure.\n\nGet up and dance. Observe your body and ask yourself how it feels. Does your body want to go quicker? Or does it feel better if it's laid back a bit? Imagine if the context that the song will be heard in. Is it a chill scenario? Or is it banging in a club where it might want some more push.\n\nSometimes the best tempo for a performance changes based on the acoustics of the room. Things like the pre-delay or tail are going to rhythmically inform you. And sometimes we key into the pulse that we feel from the echo in the room and conform to that implied rhythm.\n\nIt's kind of like how horn players will naturally discover the best sounding spot in the room for them if you allow them to wander around and play. Listen to the space and what it's telling you.\n\nIf I'm working with a live band I'll have them play to a click at a couple different speeds and ask them how it makes them feel. I'll have my own thoughts too, but getting the band thinking about it opens up fun conversations. Maybe they'll discover that Section A feels good at one tempo and then Section B is better if they speed it up a hair.",

    "content": "I went down a crazy deep rabbit hole about why different EQ\u2019s sound different and after reading a dummy amount of math papers it now makes sense to me. The bonus is that after knowing what to listen for it becomes easier to distinguish and you can choose different EQ\u2019s for different tasks more intelligently. \n\nIn short, when a developer is designing a filter they have to balance between a bunch of different math trade offs. Different math decisions will get you different amounts of ripple, ringing, attenuation, phase delay vs group delay differential, etc. Every compromise imparts a different kind of shittiness. \n\nTo hear two filters that are optimized for absolutely opposite aspects, pull up cleansweep, lowpass something pretty hard, and switch the LPF back and from being a chebyshev filter to being bessel filter.  \n\nWith eyes open one would be tempted to explain the differences entirely as being related to the amplitude ripple differences, but with eyes closed instead of just looking at the filter diagram you\u2019ll hear more time domain smearing in the chebyshev as well. \n\nI\u2019m planning on making an educational video on filter topologies if I can ever get around to it.",

    "content": "The Way to Export All Tracks from Logic to Equal the Exact Mix that the Artist/Producer Left Off From\u2122\n\n1. Any busses you want printed need to be showing as \"tracks\" in the Arrange window. You can do this from your Mix Window by selecting all busses/auxes you want to print, right-click, choose \"Create Track\", and now those Busses/Auxes will show up in your Arrange Window. Do this for any and all effects, parallel busses, etc etc\n\n2. ignore step 2\n\n3. Turn on your Cycle range you want to export (yellow bar across the top like Marv said) and select all tracks you want to export\n\n4. File --> Export --> All Tracks as Audio Files\n\n5. If next dialog box doesn't have options showing, smash that Options Button and choose various options\n  a. Range: Export Cycle Range Only\n  b. Uncheck \"Bypass Effects Plug-ins\" if you want their processing\n  b. Include Audio Tail and Include Volume/Pan Automation selected\n  c. Normalize Off\n\n6. I suggest making an AES-Standardly-named New Folder and exporting into that \n\n7. Export that bad boy\n\nThis will ensure you can import into your Industry Standard DAW exactly where they left off, minus the mix bus processing. \n\nIf they're sharing effects (e.g. guitar and vocal both going to a verb), and you want them both wet but also separate, then they'll need bounce those separately or dup the verb send/return (in which case their Valhalla Vintage Verb will be 12dB too loud b/c they'll forget to turn off their 2bus processing when they bounce it separately)",

    "content": "- The classic example of compression is to use a fast release with something like a parallel drum buss. As the release lets go and brings up the room gain you get this urgent and explosive energy. When the room is good, and the compression timing is set right it can really make things sound bigger than real life. Remember we're trying to tell a story here, we can't jam the *actual* real power and size of stadium rock drums into that mono speaker at Target but listen to Paradise City and it tells the story pretty well ... our brain does an amazing job of filling in the rest\n\n- The last example is using something like a good tube compressor on vocals. With a nice soft knee and lots of gain reduction we get bring up a bunch of low level and emotional detail, breathy whispery stuff at the end of lines etc that can really help a lyric connect. Often with something like a good tube compressor we get a healthy amount of harmonic distortion too along for the ride which adds weight to the vocal and draws the listeners attention",

Where the \u201cbrightness\u201d of the track is changes so much of how it\u2019s perceived in the track. Chances are the top end is actually much lower than you\u2019d expect. \n2) try compressing the shit out of it. Squash it allll to hell, kill the dynamics, RUIN the performance. There\u2019s a good chance if it\u2019s performed well it\u2019ll turn into a punchy percussive element that adds size and excitement. \n3) make sure it\u2019s balanced with another instrument on the other side of the the stereo field. If you don\u2019t have one that\u2019s playing something similar or has a similar top end, give it the old mono-verb/delay and see if that helps balance and keep it from being too distracting.\nHope that helps!",

What I learned is there is no right or wrong way to do anything  and it\u2019s good to try different approaches out but if you feel you are fighting something it\u2019s a good idea to check the processing and see if it\u2019s tying your hands.

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

I find that this is a side effect of everyone having the ability to be able to record from their home or wherever. It\u2019s becoming more rare to have a record made with the traditional producer/engineer team working on a record From beginning to end. It\u2019s more common a band will come in and track basics take it home for a few weeks try a bunch stuff out in their untreated room where they really can\u2019t tell if they are adding something to the arrangement that\u2019s muddying up a the song or if it  needs a different mic, positioning or eq ect. Or if in fact  it\u2019s an orchestration issue.  Regardless they add it and send it to a mixer and say it sounds shitty because it hasn\u2019t been mixed yet.  This is where I disagree with the whole \u201cthey\u2019ve been living with it for however long so just make everything better than what they had\u201d. Serban says somewhere down the line decisions haven\u2019t been made. So even though I might get push back I\u2019m going to try to do whatever  it is I think will make the mix better even if it\u2019s crossing over into  the role of production. I can always give them back what they had but often the mix needs some things muted and calls for some big moves when the scenario above happens. I know some productions are not this case and require light lifting but in my world that hasn\u2019t been the case.",

This isn\u2019t a rule, just my approach, and I do it because I know exactly how a finished track should sound in my room at that level.\n\nEvery system has a sweet spot, and if you can identify that in your setup, you\u2019ll get more consistent results. This ties into factors like speaker and amp combinations, how your speakers push air\u2014especially in the low end\u2014and how they perform at different volumes.\n\nMany speakers don\u2019t reproduce low frequencies accurately when played too softly. On the flip side, when pushed too hard, speakers often cap the low end, meaning the bass stops getting louder while the mids and highs continue increasing. This is common in everyday listening setups\u2014people crank their systems beyond their limits, causing an imbalance where the top end dominates.\n\nThis is one reason why working with a mastering engineer with a well-calibrated setup can be beneficial. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s only one way to do things\u2014some engineers work in less-than-ideal setups and still get great results. It all comes down to what works for you and gets you the sound you like.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s important to remember which i amsure you already know.... your ears perceive frequencies differently at different volumes\u2014this is a well-documented, non-linear effect. The way we hear balance changes with loudness, which is why understanding how your room and speakers respond at your chosen listening level can make a huge difference in achieving consistent, reliable masters. If you crank it... \"memorize\" in your ears how it should sound cranked. Then when you drop down to another level..\"memorize\" how it sounds there. You should then find a few spots you can use.",

So dynamics and sonic interest are your friend. If you can find ways to create contrast and change over 30 second intervals that will go a long way towards engaging the listener.

I can\u2019t really think of a reason why I\u2019d share fx unless I want something to melt together.  The fx end  up routing to their prospective group, for example vocal verb would go to vocal group ect and can be processed together if needed. I would almost never insert a verb on an individual track unless I want to push track back more into the mix. Or if I want a verb throw that simultaneously  turns the track down as I turn the verb up.  This is also the primary reason I don\u2019t like inserting fx on a individual track. If you turn the fx up you are also Turing the dry down and in most cases I\u2019m not trying do that. Also tend to process my fx, sometimes compression or saturation and also sometimes send fx to other fx. Example a delay feeding a verb",

    "content": "My go to is a 16th note. It may sound like too much when the verb return is loud but when you sink the verb down it usually is really effective for me.\n\nI like to use a mono aux with a delay plug-in for predelays, with a bus as the input and a bus to the verb as the output. No predelay on the verb itself, you make it before hand on this aux. Reason for this being you have a lot of control on your send signal that only the verb hears. A midrangey verb and a full range dry vocal make for depth and texture that can peacefully co exist. You can de ess the send harder than the real LV. With this pre delay aux you can make the send signal darker or brighter. If the song calls for it, make a second aux and have multiple predelays feeding the same verb. For example, a 16th with no feedback that is 80% wet, and a second input bus to same output bus that is dark 1/4 note 100% wet and with feedback where you can automate the send to that long feedback predelay and leave the short no feedback 1/16 static. You can get a lot of mileage out of the same verb with these multiple pre delays and provide some cohesive varied space.",

Echoing @Slow Hand, the Audio Effect Rack is so handy for mixing, creating parallel processing chains really easily, and I've also switched away from using sends and returns whenever I can in favor of setting up parallel chains in the Audio Effect Rack which makes printing stems a lot easier or A/Bing processing chains.  I also really like the User Library in Ableton for creating presets and macros of common processing chains I use.\n\nThat being said, if I were starting again in a DAW I would have switched to something else a long time ago for mixing.  There are some quirks that I've encountered with the way CPU is handled especially when you get into tracks that push super high track counts.  But I have had a hard time moving away from it just from familiarity, and they've slowly been adding features over the years that make it a little easier as a post-production DAW (groups, take lanes, linking tracks for editing, better templating tools).  But it's the opposite of lightweight and it can be unpredictably buggy when you are pushing the DAW into really high track counts.",

So you can change timing, pitch, and timbre/tone when double tracking to make it wide but also balanced. For example, double tracking guitars, keep the same guitar cab and guitar but different amp head. Or different pickups from the same entire rig. Etc. \n\nThere have been a lot of good tips for layering vocals, to have the harmonies be different mics and preamps or simply stepping away from the mic to get more distance. \n\nAs far as plugins and stereoizing, even a simple pitch shift plugin can do a lot. Delay 15-30ms each side, pitch +/- 5-10 cents, can get a cool effect if used subtly",

I've been having pretty smooth results since 2020 like this:\n\n\n- Get clients on headphones (unfortunately a necessity for feedback/delay reasons, but I'm finding a lot of times that's how they listen to most music anyway, so they're very familiar with their headphones of choice). \n\n- Have them open your Audiomovers link.\n\n - Start a Facetime/Zoom call on your phone with whoever needs to be there. Mute your own Facetime mic on your phone, but clients leave theirs open. They'll hear your chat via the talkback mic you've set up in Tools.\n\n - Use talkback mic routing as pictured. If you're a Pro Tools nerd, you can probably work out what's going on by following the routing and sidechain assignments in the screenshot, but:\n\n\nI print mixes and the limited ref (usually just tickling Pro-L 2) at the same time, so I make a Pre-Fade send to the Audiomovers bus from my Mix Print channel. This is also where the limiter lives, so their Audiomovers feed goes out at a healthy level.\n\nMy talkback channel (usually a 57) has a ducking compressor on it, sidechained from the Listen Print send and set to stun. This means my TB mic gets (more or less) muted during playback, so I can work on speakers while I make their tweaks. Muteomatic is still in my template, but I think I opted for the sidechained compressor because delay tails etc were getting double piped down to clients through my mic the moment playback stopped, whereas the compressor has adjustable release so it can come back up more or less as the tails die.\n\nIf any of that doesn't make sense, just lemme know and I can amend this post.",

I would suggest having the dynamics tamed to your liking before boosting low end in a vocal because it can easily get out of hand\n\nYou could try duplicating the take, use RX de-reverb or whatever you can to remove as much ambience as possible, compress it heavily and blend it in. Obviously compression will bring out ambience so as to not let that become an issue try removing it beforehand. \n\nAVOX duo is a neat trick I use sometimes to help give a vocal some dimension.

    "content": "Yeah dude - it has essentially all of the features of ValhallaDelay already built in... so how i do it is I find the right time pocket (1/4, 1/8, etc) and then set it up in a rack. Then i will mess w the EQ settings of the delay signal to give it the right freq content. I personally only use the ping pong and stereo modes (never really use the M/S). \n\nThen in the third tab i set up the ducking  and mess with the threshold and release settings to duck out of the way of the lead. I love the sound of the echo swelling up after the phrase is done so i'll usually start at -15 for theshold and ~100ms for release and experiment from there. that third tab also has noise, gate, and a wobble option to add some more character. Then just like the diffusion setting in valhalladelay - you can use the reverb and decay settings to add verb to the delay signal pre/on feedback/post in the chain to give it more softness/space. \n\nBut the killer feature is then you can modulate these settings in the 2nd tab... then i add a little percentage change to one side of the ping pong delay ~1.3% so it's not completely locked in and just adjust settings from there. on the first page, you can also drive the input super hard to get a distorted sound and bring down the output level (like a preamp). It's super versatile and you can get big swelling verb echoes or overdrive space echo type sounds.",

    "content": "This is also the biggest reason that analog synths have so much more solid of a lowend than any digital synth. It\u2019s not the saturation giving you that solidity. It\u2019s that hardware LPFs don\u2019t have anywhere near the same amount of cascading delay differential. I.e. a software bass synth by default has a slight reverb that is phase canceling itself wellllllll into the passband (like all the way down iirc) just by the nature of it having a digital LPF bottlenecked at 44.1, where a moog filter has very little of that going on because the sample rate of the real world is infinite, or the speed of light, depending on how you look at it.",

I've also had several sessions delayed/rescheduled because Landr was falling out of sync with the video or doing like an accordion thing where playback would be speeding up and slowing down trying to sync.

Also! I have found that one thing that totally affects the number of delay is the settings of my interface, there are a bunch of settings within the Apollo\u2019s (dsp load lock, UAD engine delay comp\u2026) that will affect the latency.

He\u2019s already made a point that\u2019s resonating with me , where he mentions that subtle , frequent changes to mix elements help reduce masking . At the moment , I\u2019m trying to use less eq and be super sensitive to phase relationships) . I find that invariably , more I \u201cshape a mix\u201d with eq and compression (even light touches ) the cleaner it sounds and the louder it can go, but the less I like it.  If  there\u2019s a route available to go down , where I can not reach for eq to reduce masking......I\u2019m trying it.. I\u2019ve a few h/w eq s that I don\u2019t mind using but ITB pro q and x eq often seem to throw off the tonal balance of a sound and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the changing phase relationships it sets off between the mix elements that\u2019s frustrating me . \nI\u2019ve seen a few mixers talking about using harmonics and reverbs instead of eq and intend to go this route, combined with some jj gems perhaps .

Mute everything.\n2. Pull up kick in and out (+ sub or whatever they've recorded). Play with balance and phase of kick out until it feels good (good is context dependent - sometimes that's deep/subby/slow, sometimes that's punchy/percussive etc).\n4. Bring up overheads along with kick mics. Flip overhead phase and play with balance til it sounds cool, or punchy, or whatever you're after. Sometimes there's a very obvious right or wrong answer, but often just figure out whatever works for the drum groove + arrangement + song. Where the bass sits can often help tell you what config will work best.\n5. Solo snare mics, get them in phase with each other (just listen together and flip usually snare bottom until the blend sounds cool to you - often I'm looking for whichever configuration has more \"thud\", but that's context dependent). \n6.Unsolo and check snares against kicks and overheads. If you need to flip the snares, flip both top and bottom (or whatever combo) together so their relative phase remains intact. \n6. Add in rooms, again flipping and balancing til shit feels cool. Do same for crush mics, any other flavour stuff.\n\nToms are usually my last concern. Unless the groove is tom heavy, they might do only 2 or 3 hits across the whole song, so as Ryan said - hand gate those fuckers and deal with them once the general sound is dialled in.",

I side changed trackspacer in the offending instruments to the lead vocal. In my case it was 1-3k range that was dominant from the vocal bleed. You might try doing that to the bass and using the low end 100-200hz bleed in the vocal as part of the bass sound and duck it in the bass when it\u2019s feeling dominant",

But it also sounds like you are split on the target that you're trying to hit in the first place.\n\nWhen the production you're given to mix is lacking in some way - maybe the sonics aren't great, the arrangement isn't great, or the song is not great - there can be an urge as mixer to want to close that gap by delivering a killer mix. Sometimes we see that gap and think that we'll be able to make this record amazing and make up for it's shortcomings by crushing the mix. But there's only so far that we can take a song at the mix stage. Maybe the record will be great anyways despite some perceived issue.\n\nWhile there's always room for improvement take care that you're not putting all of that weight on your shoulders. By all means do a great job, but know when to stop chasing an unattainable goal. It's not necessarily something that you can resolve as mixer. So - if that's the case - make sure you're not demanding the world from yourself.",

Thought of two more things that I feel is important to add that ppl might find helpful....\n\nDefinitely strip silence/cut out silences in the non-talking audio to get rid of the noise floor, coughs, etc. I do this by hand rather than the strip silence function since the function in PT might delete stuff I didn't want deleted.\n\nAt the company I freelance at, they heavily use this app called Descript. You upload your VO's and it builds out a transcript for you. You then can edit the transcript and it'll chop up the audio accordingly. It works better when the VO's are isolated/have no bleed and not recorded in the same room because bleed can mess up the transcription, but if Descript is analzying just one VO at a time, it works great. Then, you can export an .aaf and upload into PT to make fades, mix, etc. Check it out! I've used it too and it's kinda crazy. Prob the only useful AI thing I've come across. \n\nhttps://www.descript.com/",

I remember early on, I'd start at like 9:30AM/10AM and I'd probably be exporting a bounce at about 7PM. \n\nAt the company I work/freelance at, they have dedicated producers to give notes with timecodes, so the audio engineers (me), our job is to just assemble the show (cuz they record segmenets at diff times), mix it, and clean things up so to speak. Then, the producers QC it and give more notes and see if they wanna cut anythign else on top of what they initially noted.\n\nI echo what @Brendan Trinkle as it actually taking 4x the runtime. IME, that's what it looked like for me. With having a dedicated producer who's taking notes in real time from the recording, it's much faster. \n\nBut yeah, it's a growing pain if you don't have notes. If somebody is gonna QC it, it may be worth the while to just do a \"quick\" pass and have them listen to what they wanna tighten up/chop out. I think what got me faster when I was proucing and editing was not being so nit picky about cutting \"ums\" and trying to put myself into \"listener\" mode. \n\nTry to check out Descript. It might help you out seeing everything and making giant content cuts accordingly. That was the hard part early on for me while producing + editing was not knowing if bits would come back later on in the recording or not.",

Then use a quick SPL Meter in C weighted mode (loads available for iphone) and see where the SPL lands when playing back these tracks.  In my room it's around 75-80 db and I'm comfortable there.  I know that when I leave my monitor controller at my predetermined setting playing back mastered -9>Lufs tracks roughly how it should sound.  if something sounds dark/bright it's usually because it is.  Like wise if a vocal is too quiet, I'm not reaching for the main volume pot to turn the overall mix up, I'm turning the vocal up until it feels right.  And also, if my mix isn\u2019t feeling loud enough or present enough at the preset monitoring level I know I need to work harder to get it to sit in the same world as the refs.  Once you get your head around it, it\u2019s very freeing.  I use Metric Halo Monitor controller directly connected to my speakers and control via a Stremdeck (thanks @Bryan DiMaio !) and this has 5db volume steps where I know I can mix without my limiter at +10 and when the limiter is engaged I need to be back at 0. I imagine the Hilo has something similar?",

It definitely has it\u2019s uses though! But like for instance if you think of sound being transmitted through a spring in a spring reverb, every impulse will hit the spring on a different part of the spring\u2019s travel from side to side and will impact how the vibrations transmit through it in such a complex way, while every time an impulse hits the spring reverb IR it will be \u00abtransmitted\u00bb  from the same starting point",

The deadline isn\u2019t particularly tight so I had the leisure.\n\nI think depending on where you are in your career, it can be really helpful to use someone else\u2019s mixing philosophy as a learning tool, but if people are coming to you for what you do, client projects are probably not the time for that.  \n\nIn my head there\u2019s a pretty big difference between exploring a new reverb plug to potentially generate some inspiration and deciding, \u201con this project I\u2019m SIDE-CHAINING EVERYTHING\u201d when that hasn\u2019t been your thing in the past.\n\nBut also, I don\u2019t really think about this that much, and I think you\u2019ll probably have to develop your own feel for what\u2019s appropriate for you.

There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

    "content": "In my experience, double tracking the exact same instrument - like the same guitar - will usually just end up sounding phasey, not thick and wide. You really really want it to be 2 different guitars, using a different amp or EQ just doesn\u2019t really cut it, I find. And preferably also different amps and maybe even mics on the speakers. The more you\u2019re actually close to something that could literally be an acoustic event(meaning it could play out that way if you were recording both parts live simultaneously), the less phasey it will be. If vocal doubles are too close to the lead sonically, for example, they can end up sounding like a phasey reverb instead of adding punch. So definitely use a different mic. Like, even Freddie Mercury\u2018s background vocals can sometimes sound a bit one-dimensional because of this, though of course Queen\u2018s performances were utterly amazing(it usually was just one u67 they tracked with)",

But what if you convolved your audio signal with a fixed EQ curve that is 1 sample in duration?\n\nAs we all know, using a normal EQ imparts phase shift around those frequency bands, and an EQ curve with *lots* of bands, is likely to be a big, smeary, mess that distorts your phase relationships.\n\nWhat if you took a big complicated EQ curve (like the type that you'd see on a Sonarworks correction curve), sampled that, and then used it with a convolver plugin to re-apply that same complex filter to your mix buss? Would this method sidestep the phase shift that you get from using traditional EQ bands?",

    "content": "Convolution is a strange technique to describe in a way that is intuitive to understand. But here goes:\n\nIn convolution you have two audio signals, your *input signal* and your *impulse response*. The simplest description of what convolution does is that it multiplies the *input* signal by the *impulse* signal and what it spits out is a new audio signal that includes only the frequencies and amplitude values that both signals have in common.\n\nPractically speaking, what this means is that when you convolve an *input* (let's say, a full frequency drum kit recording) with your *impulse* (let's say a 5 ms burst of white noise that was hi-passed at 500 Hz). What you end up with is a drum recording that sounds like it was hi-passed at 500 Hz.\n\nThink of it like how a vocoder works (which isn't that different). Your vocoder might combine a full-frequency synthesizer patch (input) with the frequency contours and time content of your voice (impulse/carrier). But if your voice doesn't have 100 Hz in it then we never hear the 100 Hz from the synth patch because the input and carrier/\"impulse\" don't share that frequency. What you hear is what both signals have in common. If your voice has a huge peak at 1.5k, then the synth patch is going to be accentuated in that same way.\n\nSo. What I'm saying is that if I have a complex EQ curve (ala Sonarworks corrective EQ) that I use as my *impulse response* and convolve it with, say, the output of my stereo buss, will it impart that frequency curve onto my mix *without* the phase shift that you'd get from a traditional FIR or IIR filter (aka traditional EQs)?\n\nIn short, I don't know because it's hard to search for the answer online. But I'm throwing a hail mary in case we've got any DSP nerds in the forum.",

    "content": "If it's really upsetting me I might deal with it early, but I prefer to live with those details as I get the drum mix together - there's (usually) going to be bus compression, maybe added fake Oceanway room, samples and their idiosyncracies - so many variables, all often getting processed on drum bus (+ potential parallels per song section).\n\nBy the time I'm done with that it usually just feels more like a general vibe than an exercise in precision - the snare ring in the left room mic might draw the ear away from the kick flam in the right (or that flam could now groove in a cool way as the comps breathe, or it slaps against a rhythm guitar part or whatever), but I can always go back and Time Adjuster (or L/R EQ with Fab or whatever) the rooms if they're really bothering me.\n\nSame reason I don't usually address snare rings until I've got the drums working well",

Some additional things to try would be SC gates on different elements to K/S (if the rooms are a mess for sure try this on them) make some pre-fader sends of close mics and OHs and make your own room with verb/comp. To make live drums feel awesome it really takes a lot of creativity sometimes. SC gate a white or pink noise track with the snare can be cool too\u2026put a verb on it and or EQ/filter the noise.",

Unless you're Valhalla, basically every company does some variation of Summer Sale, Black Friday, Holiday, etc. etc., with varying deals throughout the year. So anyone paying attention to software purchases knows at this point that you shouldn't buy anything at full price unless you need it right away for something you're working on. If Waves is constantly on sale, then I'd suggest it's possible that it works AGAINST impulse buying by knowing you'll always have more chances (like Izotope).

That\u2019s a very different thing then linking up a snare hit to not flam. \n\nThis kinda feels like when my friend was making a movie and she kept authoritatively and confidently telling the composer to turn down the reverb and after a week in frustration she brought the stems to me and I got to go \u201coh.

    "content": "I recently revisited a mix I initially did in 2021 for an as of yet unreleased project. A folk / rock / americana track. My OG mix had this really aggressive edge to it that I kinda liked but it also felt way too scooped in the low mids. I checked out my old session and turns out I had cranked a ton of 8khz on the mixbus (a move I haven't felt compelled to do since 2021). Related I've been really enjoying thick / dense / full bodied mixes that still have excitement / edge up top especially for vocals and I had previously struggled to achieve a similar 'heft' in my own mixes compared to what I was hearing. I think in the past I was too quick to zap low mid resonances in my vocals / guitars. So I've been experimenting cutting less down around 200hz-600hz and emphasizing more. But then I felt I was losing some of that edge / excitement by see-sawing too much with the low mids relative to up top. I've found cutting some 170hz clears much of that up for me (like oh hey there's my snare or more room for kick / bass), I achieve the thickness above in that 200-600hz range and balance that with the excitement around ~8khz. Pushing and pulling.",

Im always surprised how much cleaner i can get it by rebuilding this way, even if it ends up getting slammed back into the limiter, it ends up usually workout out a little cleaner.",

If I\u2019m in that situation I am definitely looking at myself to figure out where and how I\u2019m missing the mark.\n\n3. Working with people that are not used to making professional productions can be tricky. I find that mix notes in those situations can be difficult to navigate, for instance \u201ccan you turn down the reverb\u201d ends up being a problem because now they are fixated on that note and \u201clistening for reverb\u201d in which case they just keep hearing it until it is now too low in reality.

    "content": "I find it's rarely necessary to compress a synthesizer if you're the one programming it. You already have control over the attack/sustain ratio on the instrument using the ADSR controls. And you can balance the harmonics through your choice of filtering or oscillators. Synthesizers rarely have low-level information to be revealed that can't simply be turned up at the source.\n\nOf course, you might want the distortion artifacts from compression, but I'd probably use a saturator module.\n\nThat said, if you're a mixer who has received an audio bounce of a synth, then... sure! Compression would be good for balancing poke-y stuff, controlling boomy low-end, or there could be some room tone from a re-amp signal, or some attack that needs to be accentuated. So compress away!",

It\u2019s a modular multi effect plugin, and making a few different presets on it allows me to quickly switch around between different colors and modulation. It has random parameter set feature and can unexpectedly bring in interesting sounds quickly too. Other than that, I also like Soundtoys stuff for phaser and tremolos, ubermod for chorusing and other phase effects on the delays. For reverb, Dverb is actually pretty cool especially when it\u2019s mixed in with delays. I like Valhalla vintage verb and eventide ultraverb as well. And for post verb or delay saturation, decapitator and spectre. Saturn if I wanna use the dynamics control on it. I also like messing with the polarity, sometimes flipping it can get the presence of the tail heard better without obscuring the dry sound as much.",

Then once you've possibly got something to work with, go through the usual steps you might process a vocal with  (more additive/tone-shaping tools to get a sound).\n\nThing is, if you don't have all these plugins already it would be much cheaper to just record a better vocal. (I think you can demo them all though?) Maybe even consider renting a studio for a day (if the artist has the budget).",

To go into some of your questions; I'm using Adam a7's (not the newer a7x's, although I tested them and they're wasn't as much of a difference as I had expected in my room). My room has been treated with diy panels, 14cm thick Rockwool and it sounds decent for a home recording studio. the dimensions aren't great and low lend monitoring isn't top of the charts but it's workable. Any peaks and valleys i did have have been sorted out further as much as possible with sonarworks which has really outdone my expectations. I also use Beyerdynamics dt770 pro's. \nUsually a lot of time does actually go into clip gaining, cleaning up and taking harshness out of vocals. I often take as much time just manually leveling a vocal, taking out esses etc as I do mixing. Fresh air and dopamine have indeed been big helpers and have been big steps towards that sizzle. Also the waves exciter in parallel has been working okay.\nI never seem to be able to get a multiband compressor to work well. Either I'm overdoing some of the setting or something because often i feel like it attenuates too much and other times to little in the places I want it to. I've noticed that a little boost in the low mids on pro-q3 that then also attenuates dynamically can work. \nCould you go into a bit more detail on what you mean with phase bringing a vocal more forward?\nI've also noticed that a lot of the sound I'm looking for comes from a certain sort of rolling kind of sound that might be coming from the rappers throat? I'm not sure at all about this but it seems like it's almost vocal fry but in a very natural way that is inherent to the singers/rappers voice. Idk if this is a rapping technique thing or if this is more accentuated in the mixing process, but it sounds really nice.\nDefinitely a big thankyou for all the tips!",

I wouldn\u2019t intentionally leave a lot of decisions up for the mix phase. \n\nHonestly, there\u2019s two ways you can go about this. You can revise the production and recording to get it where you want, take as much time as it takes. Or you can try to mix the hell out of it and move on to your next project. There\u2019s always more songs. Finishing is incredibly important.",

It\u2019s like, setting up several busses you ALWAYS make, so instead of doing 100 keystrokes and commands to get your busses and FX built, two clicks and they\u2019re there for you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what genre / style / level you\u2019re working at, but I\u2019d say just keep working at it. I love recording music because you can ALWAYS do it again. Time is the only thing you have to lose. With enough time, anything is possible. \n\nThat said, looking at a frequency analyzer of a whole mix you like isn\u2019t a horrible thing to do.

I can see this being used in some EDM genres, where automating reverbs to turn on and off with each chord to get the same effect. But seems odd to use it as a 'room' 'space' tool as it wont really sound like a space... i dunno just my thoughts.... but then again, i like dirty verbs. If i experience a bad rub, because of a reverb, it's often an arrangement issue tbh. Never heard a song on the radio and been like, 'man that rub in the verb, they should have reset the reverb for that part!'. \n\n-I'm not hating on it, i'm sure some people will find it useful for something.

You won\u2019t think \u201coh wow chorus is golden\u201d but if you have that 90% there already, a nice harmonic addition like that being tucked in nicely is just great on the ears man.",

And in film it\u2019s very important that the stems match *exactly*. BUT there was no master buss processing, intentionally.\n\nBut if you were to take your master chain and put it on, say, the last 5 inserts of each folder, identically, and only use dynamics plugins with sidechain inputs, you could feed your mix buss input to the sidechain of all those plugins. Then create a mix group wherein the settings for inserts f-j are linked\u2026\n\nThis would obviously be an ITB-restricted solution with a heavy processor load. And I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019d set it up in Reaper, but it\u2019d probably be even better than in Pro Tools",

It\u2019s rare that someone is singing into a decent mic and pre in a treated room (studio!?) or that they bother with mic technique.\n\nDoes anyone have tips or resources related to *really* digging into the repair of things like wonky room resonances, harsh-ass mics, inconsistent distance, and sometimes no talent? It seems like the folks working in that next level up can wave a magic wand and turn an NT1A into a 251 without harshness or dullness.\n\nI always thought vocal recording was pretty clear cut.

Things to Ques Yourself before Setting up a Room Reverb.\n2. On what Variables the Settings( Pre Delay, Decay Time, Room Size) Depends.\n\nAnswers with Examples of Some Pre Released Tracks will be Extremely Helpful!\nSpecially for Hip Hop Records",

If you have trouble hearing the effects of different reverb settings I would just open up a session, maybe something you\u2019ve already finished, and just play around with the verb settings and listen and see if you can create that sense of depth with early reflections predelay and decay. But my general stance is that if you can\u2019t hear it it doesn\u2019t really matter for this project, and if you want to hear it better you should do some experiments, stretch your ears out, and also maybe see if you need to deal with anything in your room or speakers that\u2019s obscuring the perception of space.",

As an outsider to the major label stuff , it often sounds to me like stuff is pushed way way too hard and comes across as insecure . The substance isn\u2019t there , so the compression gets put in it\u2019s place . If all things mix wise are relative , maybe the big studios mixes need re calibrating a bit with that top end",

If you're working with a Hans Zimmer style production, the orchestra will record a separate pass of long notes (everyone on the melody/chords) and a pass of shorts (ostinatos and riffs). So if the parts are really that distinct, especially if they overlap, then it makes sense to deliver them split. \n\nI have longs and short notes split to different inputs in Cubase so that I can get granular with how much reverb to add (longs usually need a little bit more to help glue the transitions together), but if they're meant to be performed as a single line, then I would deliver it merged.

Or using a compressor with a hold stage like Fabfilter C2 sidechained to the original with a slower release can sometimes be transparent.  Or honestly using the delay as an insert into compression will release really naturally.",

    "content": "I find that delays can take some aggresive EQs depending on the style. Give a wild boost on area where I want the delay to cut through and turn the overall delay down - and then compress it a little bit to duck it. \n\nAt least for reverb- I find it\u2019s not always necessarily to have a dry signal keying the compressor to duck the reverb.  Sometimes just a compressor directly on the channel will do something similar and less dramatic than ducking if that\u2019s what is needed for the song, \n\nAlso I find faders very helpful in automating effects. Because I don\u2019t always want them to duck in the same shape or ducking is something I\u2019d do to change the nature of the tail and will still need some additional shaping to give specialness to different moments.\n\nFor vocals I like copying the audio track and make separate fx tracks because I only want it on certain words. Even for overall effect, I use a separate track so I can take out certain words from reverb or clip gain them. Or even fade in words when I don\u2019t want the early part of reverb poking out too much in certain parts.",

    "content": "I use an Analog VU meter on the output of my monitor controller built by the inhouse tech who also worked at Neve (he designed and built the 8816 summing box) - he recommended the Sifam ones because their ballistics are really good - which I think is the main argument for analog vs digital. I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

I mixed the whole thing in one Pro Tools session, with a separate set of channels for each song which I\u2019d then make inactive and move onto the next song. When printing the continuous mix at the end, I\u2019d make active two songs at a time for any overlap, and constructed the long printed mix like that.\n\nIn this case though, there are multimiced drums, bass, electric guitars, keyboards, vocals. The recordings are good (from the stereo board mixes I\u2019ve heard) and the scale is such that I want to have the fidelity I\u2019d approach a studio record with, and the room to shape an identity for each song (while still sounding like they all happened on the same stage on the same night) so I\u2019m thinking to use my usual elaborate drum mix routing with parallels etc, all the bells and whistles.\n\nThis complexity would put me off mixing 23 songs in one session, but I\u2019m thinking of the inevitable crunch at the end of the project and the potential frustration of jumping between sessions.\n\nAm I thinking too deeply about this? Should I just get a drum sound and leave it there for 23 tracks, with a few rides here and there?\n\nNot much experience with this stuff so any thoughts would be very welcome please!",

Inverting the phase on the bounced file and playing back simultaneously should result in 100% silence (unless some reverbs and time based fx are used which print differently everytime)",

Do you work on it with them in the room and re build or do you stop and say I\u2019ll send you another Version later and re group after?

I think its quite magical, especially the 2nd chorus hits beautiful, if anyone has any idea what they might\u2019ve used to get that roomy live sound.

Imho they are delicious and tasty and  malnourishing like McDonalds.\n\nImho, the sound of  Robert Johnson recorded, singing crossroads in a shack somewhere a 100 years ago will still outlast the bombastic incredibly perfect production/mixes i feel encouraged to mimic today. i feel like perfection has been overdone at this point.

    "content": "Good problem to have. The first thing that jumped out to me was the fact you mix and master. I personally struggle the most with different types of workloads than one of the same. You might be more capable in that area. I assume you want to keep doing it all, but I just turn down work that isn\u2019t my ultimate goal if it\u2019s causing me workload stress. My feeling is mastering requires more organization than mixing, too. \n\nWhat\u2019s your fee structure like? Without making too many assumptions you might need to lob on or lob on more aggressive rush fees and also manage expectations on projects that dip below your rate. I mention to any client that I don\u2019t charge full rate that full rate projects that I either have on the board or come in take priority so there might be some delay in delivery of both first passes and or revisions. I also quietly prioritize clients who give me the most work and have done so for years.\n \nHow fast are you at mixing? I can do a mix in as little as an hour if I need to, not ideal, but it happens if the request is urgent enough. I also have 2 identical rigs and can make revisions at home rather than sit around at the studio waiting for notes.\n\nHow involved and capable is your assistant?",

From there, start working and take things in the direction you (or the team) feel is best.\nIt would also make sense for the sound/concept of the album to emerge as you progress through your mixes. It might click right away with the first track, or it might not fully take shape until you're working on the third song for ex. I think it's totally fine and part of the process. Communication with the artist and the producer is key here also, and this is also a great opportunity for you to have more room to shape that identity as you go.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of reading it but the performance is everything. You can\u2019t REALLY EQ air and body into a vocal that isn\u2019t there. You can\u2019t try simulate it alright. And you can\u2019t create actual excitement with compression, just try and trick the brain into thinking there\u2019s excitement. A 57 into any preamp into any interface with a stellar performance will sound amazing. \n\nAfter that is just treatment, and it\u2019s essentially pointless discussing chains because it\u2019s so song and vision dependant. \n\nA boring answer I know but you\u2019ll save a lot of headache and heart ache the sooner you learn it. \n\nIt\u2019s like when you hear a new compressor plugin just explode a drum room and it sounds amazing.

The thing is though they sounded great when I threw them up on the system, as I wanted, no big surprises, just sounded way better than on the headphones. \n\nI found the really exaggerated lows made setting the kick and bass much easier, and the sizzly  top meant I was really sensitive to it and was drawn to address sounds that were a bit harsh. \n\nIt\u2019a a bit like the inverse of working on NS10s.

I did get to know my stuff pretty well, and I can craft something that's listenable, but there's a quality that my stuff just didn't have, and I *think if I were using better tools I would've gotten closer.",

Third time I'm recording a band live in a room and not worrying about bleed and resonances. Learned my lesson lol \n\nIt's a difficult live recording, live drums with the wrong snare sound, the drummer hitting the cymbals hard, in an appartment living room, and 3 meters away, the singer.\nThe vocal mic having 50% drums and 50% vocals in it, both instruments in full range... lots of head scratching and starting from scratch again. lol\n\nI was sometimes comparing to some mastered songs, not to match them in any way necessarily, but more to get a reminder of how clear, dense, forward and big, most mixes are compared to my WIP gar(b)age mix.",

I'm the type to bite off more than I can chew, but I usually don't mind the consequences of that. I actually have another song from a different artist that is much better, maybe I'll start with that. To be fair my question was very open ended since in reality I'm also just wondering how to approach a vocal chain and vocal production beyond simply copying a preset or blindly adjusting settings on various plug ins. Something like an eq, or even other things like saturation or simple sidechain on a reverb is simple enough to somewhat understand, but the culmination of various settings and layered effects does start to get complicated and a bit unintuitive.\n\nI think fundamentally I need more attempts and practice struggling on my own, but I also think it's helpful to see if at some point I can find a bit of guidance or collaboration to accelerate my learning and focus my vision and efforts more efficiently. I appreciate your response and will try to not overthink it and focus mainly on leveling the bars to taste and moving on to practice some tuning on the vocal after. Thanks again !",

I'm talking delay throws with paralell fx chains triggered by Envelope followers with automation over automation that took a good amount of time to dial in. I completely killed it because the track was empty without it, but the feedback went something like \"chill out with the creativity.\" Which just made me realize that sometimes it does not pay off to go the extra mile with people who do not appreacite your input. \n\nThe \"sees the differential\" resonates with me, but not only with the market, but also the client. I'm telling you some of these people will tell you what's wrong with the \"filter\" but won't notice the kick is panned left, so I hardly doubt the artists, mush less listeners, notice the lack of clicks  pops, gain automation, just right amount of sibilace, and just enough tuned vocals. What they do notice is that \"it slaps\". \n\nWe've just had an indie artist break through the market here. From hundreds of monthly listeners to hundreds of thousands. Dude must've recorded the music on his phone and mixed it himself. I'm purposefully omiting the word \"master.\" And well, the listeners do not care and still consume the melody and the lyrics, so I don't know what would have to happen for people to appreciate sonic quality per se",

In a dense pop mix, it can be a lifesaver.",
