He\u2019s extremely clever and has a natural punk rock approach to things. I\u2019ve watched him mix numerous times and left thinking I could never make anything sound good in that room or with that approach but he\u2019s managed to figure it out. It\u2019s not always fast or easy but it\u2019s always unique whether you like it or not. He\u2019s been a huge inspiration to me and a constant reminder that we are making art not products.  I\u2019d like to see more engineers following their own instincts and spending less time looking at what everyone else is doing.",

    "content": "Now if you put this HPF on only the Side channel, at 100Hz what was originally +S becomes -S (180 degrees out of phase). So any 100Hz on the left now shifts to the right, and vice versa.\n\nSo say you have a rack tom with a fundamental at 100Hz panned hard left. Apply this filter to the S channel and its 100Hz fundamental will sound like it\u2019s coming out of the right side. But the top end of the tom will still sound like it\u2019s coming from the left.\n\nVery extreme example, but seen this happen IRL more than once. Easiest to hear this on headphones if you\u2019d like to experiment.\n\nI\u2019ve found the easiest way to avoid this is to use very gentle M-S slopes (gentle = less phase shift), shelves and bells, and especially avoid any steep HPF or LPF (18 dB/oct or greater).",

    "content": "@BoozleBAM This is a GREAT question, and having read the whole convo twice I don't think it was really answered. Honestly I probably won't be able to answer it either, but here are some thoughts in no particular order\n\nFirst the usual caveat, I'm not a mixer and I haven't mixed a record in a decade. But I did record and mix for 20 years before that and followed the whole arc from beginner not understanding compression, to pro finding my way and getting to own or use all of the baller dream hardware. All that to say I have a lot of empathy for where you are at with it. These are not definitive statements, just aspects to think about..\n\n1) First something of a hot take that I don't see represented online. IMO compression often makes an individual instrument sound \"worse\". If you play and record something like drums well or acoustic guitar well, a compressed version will often sound *less real* and less vital. So why in the world would we do it???\n\n- The first reason is that we mostly don't care about how individual instruments sound, we care about the whole song. Often a compressed sound will play nicer in an arrangement than something dynamic, real and recorded in a \"documentarian\" way\n\n- The second reason is a trade off that isn't often spoken about. Compressed instruments often translate better into the wild. Take a beautiful, dynamic, real sounding, hifi & documentarian recording of say upright bass, drums and acoustic guitar. Listen in your studio in great monitors and it's a dream. Now go to Target and play it in mono on the overhead speaker on a busy saturday.....it just won't survive ... the song gets lost. Or drive with your window open, or cook dinner with the AC on etc etc.",

It was already taking off so they let it be as it was, then had Schepps do the rest.\n\n\nI started out as an intern with Rob for a year in Dublin just after the Hozier album, and I remember him saying how when he got the mixes back, for a moment he thought he\u2019d been sent the wrong files - the mixes felt the same, they just sounded better.\n\nI learned so much from him and his approach to record making. Was actually thinking about how well he paces sessions when the convo about keeping artists \u201cunder control\u201d came up.\n\nHe\u2019s an amazing story teller, and has an infinite well of classics from his time with U2, Eno and Flood. He would alternate between having everyone in the room totally focused on getting their take or the part or whatever, then lift that pressure completely off with a hilarious story. Everyone would get to take a mental break, then after that pause they\u2019d be ready to go full bore again. I\u2019ve never seen albums come together as smoothly and painlessly as the ones I\u2019ve worked on with him.",

Puisheen on YouTube (mikes guitar bar) has a great tutorial. This will cost about 10$ per guitar and make a big difference.\n- computer monitors can be a big culprit, especially older Apple Cinema displays. You kinda have to right facing direction with the guitar, usually 90 degrees from the screen. Think of single coils like figure 8 microphones, you want the screen in the null.\n- ground loops can also be a big problem. I had this buzz going on DI guitars and most of my unbalanced synths - turns out one of my midi interfaces was creating a ground loop, you can get a ground lifting usb adapter. In my case I have balanced power at the studio and different phases (not sure if that the correct English term) but basically any USB hub is now on a different circuit then audio stuff and that removed a lot of buzz. On that topic, if you are using pedals make sure you have a good isolated power supply.\n- last but not least: a proper guitar setup will help, if your pickups are too low, the signal to noise ratio will decrease. That being said I think I kinda like my pickup height a little lower than standard but that is just a taste thing.",

We\u2019re banging out productions all by ourselves in a small room at breakneck speeds. \n\n2) when you\u2019re responsible for the writing, recording AND performing, and *then* the mixing, there\u2019s no possible way to achieve the perspective required to ever feel like it\u2019s a masterpiece.  \n\n3) and perhaps most important: our ears are always going to be better than our craft. We\u2019ve been listening to music for so long, and even as we continue to learn the craft our ears continue to grow as well. I think that\u2019s part of the thing that makes making music so beautifully elusive, so satisfying and unsatisfying. It\u2019s the thing that keeps us chasing. \n\n4) always looking for the next thing to help unlock the next thing is a great mindset AS LONG AS we remember there\u2019s no silver bullet.

We were in this sweet spot after I graduated out of assisting him and before we got sick of being a room together... so I got to be a lot more hands on. The files came in *roooughhh*. Eric's response was simply \"it has to sound great, they're paying us a ton of money\"... so everyone in the studio divided and conquered... I replayed the bass and some drum stuff, Eric replayed a lot of the guitars, we both added to the background vocals. The parts were all bone headed but it made such a huge difference sonically to be working with real sounds as opposed to the demo recordings that got greenlit by the label. I think Eric ended up asking for an extra production credit and he got it -- they were just so stoked with the results, they didn't care. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2BYmmTI04I",

If every part matters, than saving the very top & bottom for the choruses is a good move. \nI was always focused on stereo field, but going taller on the choruses is also on my Must list. \n\nAnd finally, detailing moments is truly where my heart is- so I love figuring out how to make every element that leads to the downbeat create the feeling of pregnant inevitably. Sometimes a super modded verb throw or a reverse that mutes right before the downbeat\u2026 somehow making things fall apart like a nude descending the staircase, then snap back together for the next downbeat\u2026 \nAssuming you\u2019re mixing your own productions, the world\u2019s your oyster.

    "content": "theres so many ways to interpret this question. so here's my take. Mixing to me at least, is all about bringing out the intent of the record to the best of your abilities. Fx. if you are mixing a Classical record, all you aim for is probably getting something as close to being in the room as possible, and therefore fidelity. If you are mixing some new urban underground cultural music, you want to respect the grittiness as that can sometimes be part of the sound and/or culture, and you never want to remove the inherent DNA of what makes that thing exciting(even tho it might be unconventional). So in the end, it's OUR job to make the decisions on when to be rough and when to be high fidelity. It's all about what you want out of the music. For most mainstream music(aka. radio oriented) i would personally get a bit of both. Get the mix sounding somewhat exciting as to pull in the listener, but also have certain aspects be high fidelity as to make it easy to listen to. FX, in a pop record, Vocal intelligibility is super important if you want people to sing along, where are in a techno track or hyperpop track you can have some grittier vocals, as they aren't as intended to be the in the car sing along song. They would be much more about the energy and feeling. \n\nIMO theres nothing more boring than a perfect mix, where every sound is perfectly inline and has no personality that makes it memorable. \n\nThe creativity of a mix is just as, if not more important, than the technicals. Thats what those cyborgs called Mastering Engineers are for.",

    "content": "I used to do consistent audiobook work 15+ years ago to supplement studio work. It was brutal work and I hated it. RX didn\u2019t exist yet, or was in it\u2019s infancy and sounded terrible. I\u2019d record and edit, used an m930 because of the low self noise which was huge for me around the time. My editing trick was to make a 5 min room tone loop the length of the book, duplicate the dialog, strip silence one track, using the dup track as a trigger to extract silence for the other track with the room tone selected, delete the dup track. In object mode select all the audio then it\u2019s something like shift + drag to fill the gaps from strip silence with the extracted room tone. Always used beat detective to do batch cross fades. Then listen through and correct to taste. RX declick would have been a game changer back then but I did all that shit by hand, if there was a pop on a word you\u2019d aim to find a similar syllable somewhere else to replace it with. At the time I was getting paid $250/finished hour for editing and $300 for tracking which was really good considering I could edit around 1.5:1 but tracking was always closer to 3:1. Budgets started shrinking right around the advent of RX. When I started, there was always an engineer, producer and proofer in the room for tracking. All lunches paid for. After enough experience I was able to provide all three which made it pretty lucrative. But the industry changed and eventually it was just engineer and reader which put a lot of pressure on the engineer to produce and proof. The  publisher I worked with stopped paying for lunch then dropped my fee to $250/$200 then $225/$175 then $200/$150 and once it hit $175/$125 I saw the writing on the wall and vowed never to do it again. I will say it upped my Pro Tools keyboard speed tremendously and kept my studio afloat early on. The halycon days of audiobook production are long gone as far as finaces are concerned.",

    "content": "this is answer might not be the most exciting.\n\nActual Separation does not come from EQ, Compression and Saturation. These are just tool to help manipulate a sound into how you want it to sound. \n\nSeparation comes from Arrangement. If you have a Piano and a Guitar playing full chords in the same octave, you'll never get good sounding separation, no matter how much you try and manipulate the sound.\nSounds are made from a fundamental and certain overtones/harmonics. If they overlap, then they overlap, even if you add a random eq boost on each sound some Freqs apart, because someone on youtube did that. (not that you can't do it, and it wont work)\nBut Instead of removing good sounding parts of a sound forcing them to fit together(whatever that even means at this point), arrange the parts so they naturally fit together with separation. This way you'll be able to act more, creatively and instinctively on how you want the sounds to sound while mixing, instead of fitting a triangle into a circle. As the good old saying says, it starts at the source, for the best results. \n\nFx, in a typical jazz band, often a Bass will play roots on 1 & 3,  a piano will of then play the root and 5th an octave above that, and a guitar could play the 3rd and 7th, and together all the instruments make big full chords while also having their own space. this way there is now plenty of room for a singer or a Sax player to do its thing and not worry to much about cutting through a dense mix.",

I\u2019d avoid condensers that have intense artifacts at high SPL because of their mic amp circuits(Brauner Phantom and the Neumann TLM series come to mind). It can be quite hard to find a condenser that has that vintage-U47 style body under a certain level of investment, which is why I might reach for a large-diaphragm dynamic or a ribbon(and boost highs). I\u2019d what that low-mid body to balance out the density in the high mids. But I\u2019m mostly talking about belly tenors here, with Betty female singer I would probably be fine with something with less body(like a U67-style mic) It\u2019s quite an in-depth topic I find, you can hit me in the dms if you have specific questions.",

More so, that my instinct telling  me if its working or not working.(feel) \nReferences in this scenario,  have never been helpful for me. I\u2019ve tried and always feels like I\u2019m cooking with someone else\u2019s ingredients.  But references have been very helpful when I work out side of my own room. When everything is foreign it helps  me understand the room when I playback music I\u2019m familiar with. \nThat all being said when I\u2019m done with a pass of the mix often I\u2019ll have my own  notes the next day that tend to be more technical and many times when I try the technical notes it doesn\u2019t always feel Better.

    "content": "Surprise surprise ima jump in with some Brauer bullshit again- zooming out of the vocal for a second, cuz I think the choices you\u2019re talking about making, when made in a vacuum, can lead you to very different places depending on what you\u2019re already hearing when you start adding vox fx. \n\nThe idea is to identify the 2 or 3 things that the brain can actually focus on at any given moment in a song as the leading roles. Song I was on the other day had horns, vocal, and occasionally gtr were leading and everything else was just supporting (either octaves of the same part, rhythmically the same, or pads on keys). So I got those 3 rocking together without worrying about every track, it was easy to identify the kind of space I needed. I wanted it in the same room as the brass, but really forward on the stage. If I\u2019d had the pads up while trying to do this I was always either too wet or too dry and couldn\u2019t find the happy place. The tl;dr is, if you\u2019re struggling to find a satisfying construction of ideas, you may be trying to treat leading and supporting parts as equally important, and you\u2019re challenging your ear to grab what\u2019s really important at that moment. \n\nAlso in Brauer\u2019s template there are a folder of verbs that everything in the session shares including vocals. So you get a sense of cohesion from that, and the vocals have their own folder of delays that are unique to them. That helps create separation.",

    "content": "Well if it's a sequenced track where I can be very pliable with the tempo one thing I'll do is to slowly adjust the tempo up and down and listen to the spaces *in between* the notes. I'll observe how that affects the feel.\n\nGoing slower will open up some space between the notes and give them a little more sense of  weight. Sometimes going too fast will make things feel cramped, or it may give it some urgency. If the song is groove-oriented this has a massive effect on the feel. Go figure.\n\nGet up and dance. Observe your body and ask yourself how it feels. Does your body want to go quicker? Or does it feel better if it's laid back a bit? Imagine if the context that the song will be heard in. Is it a chill scenario? Or is it banging in a club where it might want some more push.\n\nSometimes the best tempo for a performance changes based on the acoustics of the room. Things like the pre-delay or tail are going to rhythmically inform you. And sometimes we key into the pulse that we feel from the echo in the room and conform to that implied rhythm.\n\nIt's kind of like how horn players will naturally discover the best sounding spot in the room for them if you allow them to wander around and play. Listen to the space and what it's telling you.\n\nIf I'm working with a live band I'll have them play to a click at a couple different speeds and ask them how it makes them feel. I'll have my own thoughts too, but getting the band thinking about it opens up fun conversations. Maybe they'll discover that Section A feels good at one tempo and then Section B is better if they speed it up a hair.",

Even the most legendary mixers miss one every so often. So I very respectfully let him know the situation, and day a later a new mix of the third song came back that absolutely buried mine (as it should) and all was right with the world again.",

    "content": "- The classic example of compression is to use a fast release with something like a parallel drum buss. As the release lets go and brings up the room gain you get this urgent and explosive energy. When the room is good, and the compression timing is set right it can really make things sound bigger than real life. Remember we're trying to tell a story here, we can't jam the *actual* real power and size of stadium rock drums into that mono speaker at Target but listen to Paradise City and it tells the story pretty well ... our brain does an amazing job of filling in the rest\n\n- The last example is using something like a good tube compressor on vocals. With a nice soft knee and lots of gain reduction we get bring up a bunch of low level and emotional detail, breathy whispery stuff at the end of lines etc that can really help a lyric connect. Often with something like a good tube compressor we get a healthy amount of harmonic distortion too along for the ride which adds weight to the vocal and draws the listeners attention",

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

It\u2019s turned into a cool thing. Safe to say I read the room first\u2026 I only suggested additional production because I fully believed in helping her realise her vision as an artist, not because I was wanting to put my personal stamp on it.

Dean Lewis + UMG + the full rate = tell me what you need, I'll get it done on time. Unsigned artists at the indie rate = still get the same attention and care, I'll move fast if I can, but I won't bump other work out of the way, won't wake up at 7am to go in early, etc.\n- I prefer email but I'll do text or IG if the artist prefers. It is what it is. I have long since given up on \"Inbox Zero.\"\n- I keep a clear mind by (mostly) doing the work at my own pace, taking breaks when I want to, and not worrying too much about optimizing/organizing. Might not be the vibe for everyone, but my clients are happy and I never miss a deadline I've agreed to.\n- If I know someone's in a rush, I build the session in a way that it will also open exactly on my laptop, so I can do quick revisions at home on headphones",

    "content": "This is interesting, I do agree there are  often times decisions aren\u2019t being made. I find that this is a side effect of everyone having the ability to be able to record from their home or wherever. It\u2019s becoming more rare to have a record made with the traditional producer/engineer team working on a record From beginning to end. It\u2019s more common a band will come in and track basics take it home for a few weeks try a bunch stuff out in their untreated room where they really can\u2019t tell if they are adding something to the arrangement that\u2019s muddying up a the song or if it  needs a different mic, positioning or eq ect. Or if in fact  it\u2019s an orchestration issue.  Regardless they add it and send it to a mixer and say it sounds shitty because it hasn\u2019t been mixed yet.  This is where I disagree with the whole \u201cthey\u2019ve been living with it for however long so just make everything better than what they had\u201d. Serban says somewhere down the line decisions haven\u2019t been made. So even though I might get push back I\u2019m going to try to do whatever  it is I think will make the mix better even if it\u2019s crossing over into  the role of production. I can always give them back what they had but often the mix needs some things muted and calls for some big moves when the scenario above happens. I know some productions are not this case and require light lifting but in my world that hasn\u2019t been the case.",

    "content": "As a mastering engineer, I\u2019ve kept my monitoring level consistent for the past ten years\u2014at a relatively low volume. This isn\u2019t a rule, just my approach, and I do it because I know exactly how a finished track should sound in my room at that level.\n\nEvery system has a sweet spot, and if you can identify that in your setup, you\u2019ll get more consistent results. This ties into factors like speaker and amp combinations, how your speakers push air\u2014especially in the low end\u2014and how they perform at different volumes.\n\nMany speakers don\u2019t reproduce low frequencies accurately when played too softly. On the flip side, when pushed too hard, speakers often cap the low end, meaning the bass stops getting louder while the mids and highs continue increasing. This is common in everyday listening setups\u2014people crank their systems beyond their limits, causing an imbalance where the top end dominates.\n\nThis is one reason why working with a mastering engineer with a well-calibrated setup can be beneficial. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s only one way to do things\u2014some engineers work in less-than-ideal setups and still get great results. It all comes down to what works for you and gets you the sound you like.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s important to remember which i amsure you already know.... your ears perceive frequencies differently at different volumes\u2014this is a well-documented, non-linear effect. The way we hear balance changes with loudness, which is why understanding how your room and speakers respond at your chosen listening level can make a huge difference in achieving consistent, reliable masters. If you crank it... \"memorize\" in your ears how it should sound cranked. Then when you drop down to another level..\"memorize\" how it sounds there. You should then find a few spots you can use.",

I've been having pretty smooth results since 2020 like this:\n\n\n- Get clients on headphones (unfortunately a necessity for feedback/delay reasons, but I'm finding a lot of times that's how they listen to most music anyway, so they're very familiar with their headphones of choice). \n\n- Have them open your Audiomovers link.\n\n - Start a Facetime/Zoom call on your phone with whoever needs to be there. Mute your own Facetime mic on your phone, but clients leave theirs open. They'll hear your chat via the talkback mic you've set up in Tools.\n\n - Use talkback mic routing as pictured. If you're a Pro Tools nerd, you can probably work out what's going on by following the routing and sidechain assignments in the screenshot, but:\n\n\nI print mixes and the limited ref (usually just tickling Pro-L 2) at the same time, so I make a Pre-Fade send to the Audiomovers bus from my Mix Print channel. This is also where the limiter lives, so their Audiomovers feed goes out at a healthy level.\n\nMy talkback channel (usually a 57) has a ducking compressor on it, sidechained from the Listen Print send and set to stun. This means my TB mic gets (more or less) muted during playback, so I can work on speakers while I make their tweaks. Muteomatic is still in my template, but I think I opted for the sidechained compressor because delay tails etc were getting double piped down to clients through my mic the moment playback stopped, whereas the compressor has adjustable release so it can come back up more or less as the tails die.\n\nIf any of that doesn't make sense, just lemme know and I can amend this post.",

    "content": "I've done a couple songs with two full kits... it really depends. If they are both playing the same part on the kick, sometimes ill just cut the close mics on one drummers kick and use one in the middle, then do a little stereo spread on the rest of the kit of the two drummers so theire each a bit left, and a bit right of center... Depends on how creative your allowed to go with it? Are there rough mixes? You could also do some fun stuff in specific sections, like both kits mono and hard panned? Just make sure to check your mix in headphones once in a while, it can get weird fast depending on your taste. Are you allowed to do any editing? If the flamming is not musical or adding to the vibe, it might be worth tightening up some sections where needed.",

    "content": "I think that might be a limiting factor on top of the artists' abilities (Pop Smoke already sounded dope before his setup got professional https://youtu.be/317TP4JOSSE). I've recorded not-so-great rappers through nice chains and mixing wasn't the answer to save a (lacking) source. It never gave you *that* feeling. But even if you are recording great rappers cheaper mics tend to lack body and rarely have \"boostable\" or pleasant top end as you said. So it's a bit complicated before you even get to \"mixing\". Felt that was important to mention so you're not too hard on yourself.\n\nBut assuming that the limiting factor really is just mixing there's a bunch of options. First things first: is your monitoring and listening environment decent? Or are you on headphones? This could make placing vocals even harder for you. \n\nThen do you have a process that starts with vocal cleanup to get rid of or reduce unappealing harshness or performance issues? Despite being simple, people tend to skip basic tools like clip-gain to even out a performance. This should usually also give you some leeway for strategic boosts. Maybe instead of EQ look at harmonics. Fresh Air by Slate is free. Gem Dopamine is nice. Spectre is great. All of these should give you that \"sizzle\" you might be missing.\n\nThen to get the presence and even out the performance you could try some parallel compression with something like an 1176. Also, try out Multiband Compression with the Mcdsp 404 or C6 or whatever you have to control the performance throughout the song once you've got a vocal sound you like.\n\nI also find mixing the 808 & drums together with the vocal the most useful when it comes to gain staging and getting the song to feel right.\n\nObviously, there's more that could be said but I find processes more helpful than tools. It's art at the end of the day. Attached what Serban's assistant sees as their/his \"mixing process\". Mix more and experiment with what you have. Get feedback from the artists.",

I've also had several sessions delayed/rescheduled because Landr was falling out of sync with the video or doing like an accordion thing where playback would be speeding up and slowing down trying to sync.  Again, could 100% just be individual connections but it happened enough where I've given up on it twice.\n\nThe other side perk of using Audiomovers is I'll just ask what video chat software the other person wants to use - using whatever they're familiar with (Google Meet/Zoom/Facetime, whatever)",

Mute everything.\n2. Pull up kick in and out (+ sub or whatever they've recorded). Play with balance and phase of kick out until it feels good (good is context dependent - sometimes that's deep/subby/slow, sometimes that's punchy/percussive etc).\n4. Bring up overheads along with kick mics. Flip overhead phase and play with balance til it sounds cool, or punchy, or whatever you're after. Sometimes there's a very obvious right or wrong answer, but often just figure out whatever works for the drum groove + arrangement + song. Where the bass sits can often help tell you what config will work best.\n5. Solo snare mics, get them in phase with each other (just listen together and flip usually snare bottom until the blend sounds cool to you - often I'm looking for whichever configuration has more \"thud\", but that's context dependent). \n6.Unsolo and check snares against kicks and overheads. If you need to flip the snares, flip both top and bottom (or whatever combo) together so their relative phase remains intact. \n6. Add in rooms, again flipping and balancing til shit feels cool. Do same for crush mics, any other flavour stuff.\n\nToms are usually my last concern. Unless the groove is tom heavy, they might do only 2 or 3 hits across the whole song, so as Ryan said - hand gate those fuckers and deal with them once the general sound is dialled in.",

I side changed trackspacer in the offending instruments to the lead vocal. In my case it was 1-3k range that was dominant from the vocal bleed. You might try doing that to the bass and using the low end 100-200hz bleed in the vocal as part of the bass sound and duck it in the bass when it\u2019s feeling dominant",

But it also sounds like you are split on the target that you're trying to hit in the first place.\n\nWhen the production you're given to mix is lacking in some way - maybe the sonics aren't great, the arrangement isn't great, or the song is not great - there can be an urge as mixer to want to close that gap by delivering a killer mix. Sometimes we see that gap and think that we'll be able to make this record amazing and make up for it's shortcomings by crushing the mix. But there's only so far that we can take a song at the mix stage. Maybe the record will be great anyways despite some perceived issue.\n\nWhile there's always room for improvement take care that you're not putting all of that weight on your shoulders. By all means do a great job, but know when to stop chasing an unattainable goal. It's not necessarily something that you can resolve as mixer. So - if that's the case - make sure you're not demanding the world from yourself.",

Thought of two more things that I feel is important to add that ppl might find helpful....\n\nDefinitely strip silence/cut out silences in the non-talking audio to get rid of the noise floor, coughs, etc. I do this by hand rather than the strip silence function since the function in PT might delete stuff I didn't want deleted.\n\nAt the company I freelance at, they heavily use this app called Descript. You upload your VO's and it builds out a transcript for you. You then can edit the transcript and it'll chop up the audio accordingly. It works better when the VO's are isolated/have no bleed and not recorded in the same room because bleed can mess up the transcription, but if Descript is analzying just one VO at a time, it works great. Then, you can export an .aaf and upload into PT to make fades, mix, etc. Check it out! I've used it too and it's kinda crazy. Prob the only useful AI thing I've come across. \n\nhttps://www.descript.com/",

    "content": "@sinaigimenez You can go very scientific with this, but first thing I would do is find a handful of your favourite tracks and play them back at a level where you feel comfortable in your room - not too loud that it hurts, but feels relatively balanced.  Then use a quick SPL Meter in C weighted mode (loads available for iphone) and see where the SPL lands when playing back these tracks.  In my room it's around 75-80 db and I'm comfortable there.  I know that when I leave my monitor controller at my predetermined setting playing back mastered -9>Lufs tracks roughly how it should sound.  if something sounds dark/bright it's usually because it is.  Like wise if a vocal is too quiet, I'm not reaching for the main volume pot to turn the overall mix up, I'm turning the vocal up until it feels right.  And also, if my mix isn\u2019t feeling loud enough or present enough at the preset monitoring level I know I need to work harder to get it to sit in the same world as the refs.  Once you get your head around it, it\u2019s very freeing.  I use Metric Halo Monitor controller directly connected to my speakers and control via a Stremdeck (thanks @Bryan DiMaio !) and this has 5db volume steps where I know I can mix without my limiter at +10 and when the limiter is engaged I need to be back at 0. I imagine the Hilo has something similar?",

Treat yourself like a producer who sent you a track to mix\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter how messy it is, you gotta freeze everything and simplify your life. I\u2019m working on a pop record for one of my favorites clients and before I went into mix it, we were at about 100 tracks and it nearly ate me alive until I started removing the excess that was driving me insane. For instance, all the backing vocals can probably become one track by now rather than one group, your leads can become one if they\u2019re close enough, etc.\n\nMake copies of previous saves, but honestly commit to your production choices, take time away from the track, and be honest with your client about the fact that you\u2019ll need a little more time than normal due to the irregularity of mixing your own production.",

    "content": "Got a question for my Audio DSP nerds: Does convolution of two audio signals introduce phase shift?\n\nConvolution is most often used for reverbs, where phase shift is acceptable. But what if you convolved your audio signal with a fixed EQ curve that is 1 sample in duration?\n\nAs we all know, using a normal EQ imparts phase shift around those frequency bands, and an EQ curve with *lots* of bands, is likely to be a big, smeary, mess that distorts your phase relationships.\n\nWhat if you took a big complicated EQ curve (like the type that you'd see on a Sonarworks correction curve), sampled that, and then used it with a convolver plugin to re-apply that same complex filter to your mix buss? Would this method sidestep the phase shift that you get from using traditional EQ bands?",

    "content": "Convolution is a strange technique to describe in a way that is intuitive to understand. But here goes:\n\nIn convolution you have two audio signals, your *input signal* and your *impulse response*. The simplest description of what convolution does is that it multiplies the *input* signal by the *impulse* signal and what it spits out is a new audio signal that includes only the frequencies and amplitude values that both signals have in common.\n\nPractically speaking, what this means is that when you convolve an *input* (let's say, a full frequency drum kit recording) with your *impulse* (let's say a 5 ms burst of white noise that was hi-passed at 500 Hz). What you end up with is a drum recording that sounds like it was hi-passed at 500 Hz.\n\nThink of it like how a vocoder works (which isn't that different). Your vocoder might combine a full-frequency synthesizer patch (input) with the frequency contours and time content of your voice (impulse/carrier). But if your voice doesn't have 100 Hz in it then we never hear the 100 Hz from the synth patch because the input and carrier/\"impulse\" don't share that frequency. What you hear is what both signals have in common. If your voice has a huge peak at 1.5k, then the synth patch is going to be accentuated in that same way.\n\nSo. What I'm saying is that if I have a complex EQ curve (ala Sonarworks corrective EQ) that I use as my *impulse response* and convolve it with, say, the output of my stereo buss, will it impart that frequency curve onto my mix *without* the phase shift that you'd get from a traditional FIR or IIR filter (aka traditional EQs)?\n\nIn short, I don't know because it's hard to search for the answer online. But I'm throwing a hail mary in case we've got any DSP nerds in the forum.",

But fidelity cannot IMO be appreciated in these specific places. \n\nOfc there are exceptions. But try eating at a restaurant on a beach promenade in south Spain and the restaurant next to you has a speaker 20 inches from your head blasting a different song. And tell me you think the vocal is warm or the drums are punchy. I think, sadly for general non music fans what they find in music, is less quiteness it\u2019s not even about the song. \n\nWhereas I think the people who enjoy music, will appreciate that extra punchy drum sound or warm vocal and deep bass. And I believe those people use headphones 80% of the time. They might have a great speaker system at home. But how much time do we really have at home listening to said speakers? Headphones are with us on the go all the time. Everyone I know under 30. Listens primarily on headphones. Or their iPhone speaker. Sometimes a JBL at the beach or park, and every now and then a party speaker at a party while drunk. The ones who really really love music, either have an old vintage speaker set from their parents or a Sonnos/smart speaker type thing. \n\nI still believe mixing for speakers is important, and @Nomograph Mastering has a great point in speakers translating to headphones easier than vice versa. But I always make sure shit sounds amazing on my AirPods. I\u2019d rather sacrifice something in the speaker than the AirPods. But then again. I don\u2019t have the accolades you do. So I might be shooting myself in the foot. But that is my general philosophy.",

It begins sounding like you're standing in the audience watching him perform and it seamlessly melts away into a full studio production over the course of a few minutes.

High frequencies move in a laser beam shape and low frequencies move in a spherical shape. Nobody is ever turning with their ear facing 1 foot from a mouth that is laserbeaming high end into their ears. This is why you almost never hear saliva drips and lip smacking when in conversation and hear it constantly in recordings. This is also a big reason why the high end of most captures sounds so rough and edgy compared to real life. A lot of what I\u2019m doing is going in and massaging that high end to take it from \u201cthis sounds like a mic capsule\u201d to \u201cthis sounds like the person is in the room\u201d",

    "content": "I recently revisited a mix I initially did in 2021 for an as of yet unreleased project. A folk / rock / americana track. My OG mix had this really aggressive edge to it that I kinda liked but it also felt way too scooped in the low mids. I checked out my old session and turns out I had cranked a ton of 8khz on the mixbus (a move I haven't felt compelled to do since 2021). Related I've been really enjoying thick / dense / full bodied mixes that still have excitement / edge up top especially for vocals and I had previously struggled to achieve a similar 'heft' in my own mixes compared to what I was hearing. I think in the past I was too quick to zap low mid resonances in my vocals / guitars. So I've been experimenting cutting less down around 200hz-600hz and emphasizing more. But then I felt I was losing some of that edge / excitement by see-sawing too much with the low mids relative to up top. I've found cutting some 170hz clears much of that up for me (like oh hey there's my snare or more room for kick / bass), I achieve the thickness above in that 200-600hz range and balance that with the excitement around ~8khz. Pushing and pulling.",

Equally it depends if I'm in the room with an artist. They don't want to see me going deep on EQ or saturation moves and wasting their valuable time, so in a session I'll often wait until I'm unattended and I can go deep afterwards.",

I\u2019d calibrate d it nicely to 40 then remembered a spike stent lecture talking about how he changed his underground bass heavy U.K. sound to a more American sound when he made it over to LA. He said he rounded off the sub a little higher from then on and moved the focus of the low end up. Particularly putting more emphasis on 200 hz for his kicks then 60 etc as he had always before . That\u2019s played on my mind a lot as an Englishman who loves American engineering \u2026..so I thought I\u2019d throw a 200 hz tone into another h/w Vog  and set that up for a kick bump if I want it .

    "content": "Same situation here, I used to avoid the \"reality check\" at the beginning of the mix so I could move primarily by feel. But then I was consistently making macro EQ moves on the mix bus in order to match the references a bit more at the end of the mix (typical 2db presence boost, maybe some 200-300hz scoop). This was a real pain in the ass, cause naturally things change a bit at that point and it's not an effective way to handle the problem. So now I have a preset for MetricAB with 8 reference tracks ready to go that I listen for short periods of time, sometimes 5 seconds or so, just to keep my years calibrated to what \"normal\" feels like in a macro-level. The fact that I don't need to leave the DAW environment (changing the visuals as well) to open a streaming app with different stimulus makes it really convenient to just do the right thing and compare apples to apples. The band-isolation mode really helps me to compare how different frequency ranges are moving also",

Tradeoffs there. Could also play around with formant shifting some with melodyne or alterboy.

You already have control over the attack/sustain ratio on the instrument using the ADSR controls. And you can balance the harmonics through your choice of filtering or oscillators. Synthesizers rarely have low-level information to be revealed that can't simply be turned up at the source.\n\nOf course, you might want the distortion artifacts from compression, but I'd probably use a saturator module.\n\nThat said, if you're a mixer who has received an audio bounce of a synth, then... sure! Compression would be good for balancing poke-y stuff, controlling boomy low-end, or there could be some room tone from a re-amp signal, or some attack that needs to be accentuated. So compress away!",

Also, Dale mentioned some routine of listening to reference tracks at a predetermined volume before starting a session, but I\u2019m going off memory, so I\u2019m not sure.\n\nMy setup is ATC 25s and a Lynx Hilo. Would I need anything else to calibrate the system, like an SPL meter?\n\nI\u2019m almost embarrassed to ask this after 10 years of mixing, but while I\u2019ve always tried to be consistent with my listening levels, I never learned the proper way to do it.\n\nThanks!!!",

I\u2019ve also gotten used to running them with an EQ to fill in the 2800hz dip, which makes taking them around tougher as a plug n play travel option.  They also bleed as open back cans so your neighbors in public spaces will definitely hear you working.  \n\nAPM I personally trust less for work as a reference with my ears but the pros outweigh the cons so heavily and they have a high utility outside of work as a travel headphone.",

To go into some of your questions; I'm using Adam a7's (not the newer a7x's, although I tested them and they're wasn't as much of a difference as I had expected in my room). My room has been treated with diy panels, 14cm thick Rockwool and it sounds decent for a home recording studio. the dimensions aren't great and low lend monitoring isn't top of the charts but it's workable. Any peaks and valleys i did have have been sorted out further as much as possible with sonarworks which has really outdone my expectations. I also use Beyerdynamics dt770 pro's. \nUsually a lot of time does actually go into clip gaining, cleaning up and taking harshness out of vocals. I often take as much time just manually leveling a vocal, taking out esses etc as I do mixing. Fresh air and dopamine have indeed been big helpers and have been big steps towards that sizzle. Also the waves exciter in parallel has been working okay.\nI never seem to be able to get a multiband compressor to work well. Either I'm overdoing some of the setting or something because often i feel like it attenuates too much and other times to little in the places I want it to. I've noticed that a little boost in the low mids on pro-q3 that then also attenuates dynamically can work. \nCould you go into a bit more detail on what you mean with phase bringing a vocal more forward?\nI've also noticed that a lot of the sound I'm looking for comes from a certain sort of rolling kind of sound that might be coming from the rappers throat? I'm not sure at all about this but it seems like it's almost vocal fry but in a very natural way that is inherent to the singers/rappers voice. Idk if this is a rapping technique thing or if this is more accentuated in the mixing process, but it sounds really nice.\nDefinitely a big thankyou for all the tips!",

I wouldn\u2019t intentionally leave a lot of decisions up for the mix phase. \n\nHonestly, there\u2019s two ways you can go about this. You can revise the production and recording to get it where you want, take as much time as it takes. Or you can try to mix the hell out of it and move on to your next project.

It\u2019s like, setting up several busses you ALWAYS make, so instead of doing 100 keystrokes and commands to get your busses and FX built, two clicks and they\u2019re there for you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what genre / style / level you\u2019re working at, but I\u2019d say just keep working at it. I love recording music because you can ALWAYS do it again. Time is the only thing you have to lose. With enough time, anything is possible. \n\nThat said, looking at a frequency analyzer of a whole mix you like isn\u2019t a horrible thing to do.

    "content": "@Gazing Wrmth | Mixes & Masters I\u2019m pretty much exclusively in cans and i second all of what Noah said. Additionally, sonarworks for your headphones is definitely worth it esp. for only 70 USD. It will smear transients a bit, but you can get over that if you reference well. Mix quiet and you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nForgot to mention, because DT 770s are closed back, making sure you have a good seal and taking breaks are critical. You need a 15 minute break for every hour you put in on cans, bare minimum IMO. Without that, attention loss and fatigue kick in. \n\nTools like tonal balance control 2 are important. I recommend setting up a Pro-MB with 3-5 bands across the entire frequency range but make them all neutral with no compression. Sub, low, mid, high mid, top end. You can monitor specific ranges now. And for sub/low end, you can turn the gain up on your headphone mix a bit, isolate the low end, and you can hear it a bit better. Make sure you turn your headphones down a bit before you un-solo the low or the sub, but this has helped me massively",

I've tried the Canopener, Sonarworks, manual EQ, etc, and my best stuff is always a result of spending a lot of time referencing other mixes I know and love combined with a ton of car checks, speaker tests.\n\nI can't wait for the day I have a space where I'm able to make noise, get some 310s and some treatment and stop chasing my tail and spend 3-4x the amount of time getting to where I want to go.  That's the hope anyway.\n\nI'm not trying to deter anyone from getting started getting practice mixing in headphones, but it's definitely a stopgap for me and one I'm getting more and more fatigued by personally as the years go on.",

    "content": "A couple things - there are no \u201cshoulds\u201d in music. Play around until it sounds good. If you have trouble hearing the effects of different reverb settings I would just open up a session, maybe something you\u2019ve already finished, and just play around with the verb settings and listen and see if you can create that sense of depth with early reflections predelay and decay. But my general stance is that if you can\u2019t hear it it doesn\u2019t really matter for this project, and if you want to hear it better you should do some experiments, stretch your ears out, and also maybe see if you need to deal with anything in your room or speakers that\u2019s obscuring the perception of space.",

If you know where the sweet spot of a compressor is on a drum bus for example, you can calibrate 0 on the VU meter to that sweetspot. then mixing into your compressor isn't such a guessing game every time (because you get the needle bouncing around 0, not too far under or not too far over). \n\ni use a digital one on the way out when i'm hitting my analog chain so everything goes out at the relative same level. i use an analog one on the way back in calibrated to a \"safe\" level and i know when it's coming back in ultra hot or i need a little extra gain to get it to the sweet spot. when you're monitoring stays at a consistent level, VU meters can help you judge relative relationships quite easily. i could see it being useful in the use case you described if you've calibrated the VU accordingly. say you want to generally hit -10 at the mixbus...calibrate a -10 signal to 0 on the VU. everything you then feed into the mixbus will show on the VU + or - where you want to end up.",

    "content": "I use an Analog VU meter on the output of my monitor controller built by the inhouse tech who also worked at Neve (he designed and built the 8816 summing box) - he recommended the Sifam ones because their ballistics are really good - which I think is the main argument for analog vs digital. I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

    "content": "[Apologies for long message, I\u2019m thinking out loud but also detail is probably useful] Gearing up to mix a live album with a heap of songs (tbc but potentially 23 in one show).\n\nThe last time I did something like this, it was low channel count -   a couple of acoustics, one or two vocals, maybe a keyboard per song. I mixed the whole thing in one Pro Tools session, with a separate set of channels for each song which I\u2019d then make inactive and move onto the next song. When printing the continuous mix at the end, I\u2019d make active two songs at a time for any overlap, and constructed the long printed mix like that.\n\nIn this case though, there are multimiced drums, bass, electric guitars, keyboards, vocals. The recordings are good (from the stereo board mixes I\u2019ve heard) and the scale is such that I want to have the fidelity I\u2019d approach a studio record with, and the room to shape an identity for each song (while still sounding like they all happened on the same stage on the same night) so I\u2019m thinking to use my usual elaborate drum mix routing with parallels etc, all the bells and whistles.\n\nThis complexity would put me off mixing 23 songs in one session, but I\u2019m thinking of the inevitable crunch at the end of the project and the potential frustration of jumping between sessions.\n\nAm I thinking too deeply about this? Should I just get a drum sound and leave it there for 23 tracks, with a few rides here and there?\n\nNot much experience with this stuff so any thoughts would be very welcome please!",

Too much comp can kill dynamic energy but a lil clipping, Tube EQ, and volume automation was nice with a parallel Opto or VariMu for what I needed. For faster staccato stuff YMMV with that parallel, 1176 or distressor may be better but you or someone else might have a better idea",

I always do a quiet listen or a headphone city walk to see if I loose important elements in the quiet bits to make sure I don\u2019t overshoot the dynamics. Also don\u2019t get stuck in a loop of just one section for too long. Also sometimes I start the intro a little louder and slowly let the volume settle to where I actually want it in the verse if I want it to actually be a bit more dynamic\u2026 just a subtle bump of the intro guitar/piano etc then let it settle under the vocal can help it appear loud enough in a playlist off the top and still let you have some contrast from verse to chorus. I know I said two conflicting things- depends on the arrangement",

Do you work on it with them in the room and re build or do you stop and say I\u2019ll send you another Version later and re group after?  The reason I ask is I generally want to spend more time on ideas than the artist, they may say yes that\u2019s great and let move on and I may want to work on it for a bit in  more detailed manner.",

And though I agree that \"Don't Start Now\" is more my style of mix, and beautifully executed...\"Dance The Night\" has a character to it and does its job well. It's not as aggressive, it's more vocal forward, and evokes a sort of fantasy vibe. It's impossible to say what goes on behind closed doors but it doesn't sound particularly horrible to me. The focus is on Dua, the lyric, and the more \"glittery\" aspect of disco and I think they earned their fee",

Imho they are delicious and tasty and  malnourishing like McDonalds.\n\nImho, the sound of  Robert Johnson recorded, singing crossroads in a shack somewhere a 100 years ago will still outlast the bombastic incredibly perfect production/mixes i feel encouraged to mimic today. i feel like perfection has been overdone at this point.

I'm hitting my multiband different, hitting my clipper different, hitting my limiter different; so if I were to simply execute that note, now the vocal, guitar, pretty much everything shifts a good bit in energy and I then spend time making the mix work again now that a big chunk of energy got pushed up in it. (side note - I like to mix a bit more gentle/tight on the low-end side since the lows are so hot in car systems, headphones, entertainment centers, etc. these days. Midrange is my home base.)

From there, start working and take things in the direction you (or the team) feel is best.\nIt would also make sense for the sound/concept of the album to emerge as you progress through your mixes. It might click right away with the first track, or it might not fully take shape until you're working on the third song for ex. I think it's totally fine and part of the process. Communication with the artist and the producer is key here also, and this is also a great opportunity for you to have more room to shape that identity as you go. In these cases (where the sounds are less baked) it opens up creative opportunities worth exploring and pushing further",

The point Josh makes here in regard to being careful of the time / phase relationships of drum multitracks between close and middle distance / room mics (due to distance travelled of the signal to each mic )  is pertinent to where I\u2019m at at the moment. I\u2019d seen jacquire king discussing how he\u2019s looking to have his transients on his drums and bass all hitting on the positive phase of the signal so he can insure he has his signals  pushing and pulling the speakers in unison and not trying to push and pull at the same time . I\u2019m still wondering how I can really achieve this if I\u2019m allowing a few milliseconds phase delay between my kick close mics on the multi track .",

Me - I only consistently find it useful in two places. 1: Vocals as essentially a volume leveler. 2: Bass - For whatever reason, I really like the sound a very \"pinned down\" bass. Other than that, I haven't found compression very helpful. I'm always hearing of people going crazy with it and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out?? - Especially with drums?? I can see what it's doing when I apply it - to the drums - but I just don't find that I ever produce a very helpful or flattering result... And golly - A little while back I was working on one of my songs with a mixer whom I hold in VERY high regard. He was guiding me through my mix with his methods - Basically using parallel compression on everything, and I remember distinctly feeling several times as though my \"hands were tied\" - The session felt very \"stiff\" with all that going on. Anyway... Thanks.",

And like you say, you understood lots of records had been made on KRK's so why shouldn't you be able to? Why did it take a Grammy winning mix engineer suggesting you get new speakers to realize you needed to? (i ask rhetorically, i'm not grilling you on this, just interested in the train of thought cuz i've been here). And to what end can we follow that and evaluate our scaffolds for actual weak points? Cuz I have friends from all over the spectrum in terms of speaker preference, gear preference, philosophies, etc... that all tell me I NEED to get this thing or the other to properly level up. For me personally, once I got to a certain threshold (room dialed in, ATC's calibrated) I've been seriously dubious about pretty much anything else being thrown my way.

Transient control, room ambience, obviously pure level? \n\nAny thoughts on this? I suppose I\u2019m talking about front to back depth but without making it seem too obvious. I see some guys using compression over the instrument buss that\u2019s grabbing the instruments and holding them at a certain level and letting the vocal Poke above. I\u2019d imagine this contrast in attacks would create that separation. \n\nAnother example might be having a tambourine or shaker that inherently have a bright and transient nature that is also able to appear as if it\u2019s not up front.",

    "content": "I would definitely say the chain, say fx, pre, mic etc is almost inconsequential against the vocal performance. Every extra minute spent on trying to iron it all out there will save you hours in editing and mixing. I\u2019ve often considered selling a piece of gear and then had a really stellar vocal go through only to realise there was nothing wrong with the gear. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of reading it but the performance is everything. You can\u2019t REALLY EQ air and body into a vocal that isn\u2019t there. You can\u2019t try simulate it alright. And you can\u2019t create actual excitement with compression, just try and trick the brain into thinking there\u2019s excitement. A 57 into any preamp into any interface with a stellar performance will sound amazing. \n\nAfter that is just treatment, and it\u2019s essentially pointless discussing chains because it\u2019s so song and vision dependant. \n\nA boring answer I know but you\u2019ll save a lot of headache and heart ache the sooner you learn it. \n\nIt\u2019s like when you hear a new compressor plugin just explode a drum room and it sounds amazing. Analogue glue, explosive release, so much groove. And then you slap it on the lacklustre room and performance you actually have in front of you and it doesn\u2019t seem to sound so amazing any more.",

The thing is though they sounded great when I threw them up on the system, as I wanted, no big surprises, just sounded way better than on the headphones. \n\nI found the really exaggerated lows made setting the kick and bass much easier, and the sizzly  top meant I was really sensitive to it and was drawn to address sounds that were a bit harsh. \n\nIt\u2019a a bit like the inverse of working on NS10s.

I lean heavily \u201cvocal > everything\u201d when I mix, and nearly every time I do this bandpassing reframe I notice something I\u2019d missed in the interplay between the rest of the elements and the whole project is upgraded as a result. \n\nI think it\u2019s totally fair to warn against the pitfalls of such maneuvers in the same way that it\u2019s fair to warn against abusing energy drinks, but when it\u2019s just once a week before an intense workout, an energy drink is actually a big win with little to no downside.",

Once on the phone, you can blend the parallel with the bass in a way where there\u2019s little to no audible difference on a monitor, but the illusion of a bass can be heard through the harmonics playing on the phone.\n- It\u2019s a balancing act, but there\u2019s almost always a nice sweet spot to be found where it doesn\u2019t change the quality of the sound enough to be intrusively perceived on HD speakers, while giving life to the bass on lesser speakers.\n\nThis has helped my bass translate to more systems, and is the only time I find myself wanting to use the CLA76.",

Reading about SF right now, and it seems to be the cut-off point where room modes occur below that. The smaller the room the higher the cutoff point, and that's when the snare/tom fundamental frequency gets blurred by room modes?",

I'm always leaning more on a closer room mics or some sort of mono kit / front of kit to give me that feeling of the drum set as a single instrument. If I'm tracking I'm always giving myself a few different options around the kit closer to the shells for that and using the overheads as a way to give clarity or weight to the cymbals if they feel too washy.",

If the intro of the song is coming in at -22 LUFS, then its probably gonna sound extremely quiet relative to another song's final chorus (or even worse, another song on some streaming playlist).",
