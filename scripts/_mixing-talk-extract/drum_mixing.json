    "content": "Man this thread was a roller coaster. I think a lot of people have touched on it here, but at least for me there was no \u201cthis blog\u201d or \u201cthis YouTube\u201d, which in some ways is a bummer, but it\u2019s also liberating. Truthfully EVERY SINGLE PROJECT I do, to this day, I learn something new on. And my workflow is just the accumulation of all those different little moments. For instance, this last matt Maeson live record thing, there was a cymbal bleed problem that led me to figuring out how to use soothe on the vocal mic sidechained to the overheads to duck specific frequencies. I\u2019ll use that technique more often from here on out, and I shared it with the group here to maybe help someone else take a shortcut the next time.\n\nEVERY blog has given me an insight or two, even if it\u2019s a Streaky video where I go \u201cwell shit I DONT wanna do that\u201d. There\u2019s a million different water stations along the route of this marathon, rather than one big firehouse around mile 10. \n\nSecond, this thread feels like a good place to remind everyone that mixing is a people business; you\u2019re literally hired to make sure someone is pleased at the end of the process. Learning how to debate/take or givecriticism/get or give notes without coming off as a dick is quite possible the single most valuable lesson. No matter how good your 26hz is if people don\u2019t want to work with you you\u2019re not gonna have much of a career.",

    "content": "Now if you put this HPF on only the Side channel, at 100Hz what was originally +S becomes -S (180 degrees out of phase). So any 100Hz on the left now shifts to the right, and vice versa.\n\nSo say you have a rack tom with a fundamental at 100Hz panned hard left. Apply this filter to the S channel and its 100Hz fundamental will sound like it\u2019s coming out of the right side. But the top end of the tom will still sound like it\u2019s coming from the left.\n\nVery extreme example, but seen this happen IRL more than once. Easiest to hear this on headphones if you\u2019d like to experiment.\n\nI\u2019ve found the easiest way to avoid this is to use very gentle M-S slopes (gentle = less phase shift), shelves and bells, and especially avoid any steep HPF or LPF (18 dB/oct or greater).",

The monthly tailspin, I know it well \ud83d\ude02\n\nOne thing that I have found to be very helpful to reduce masking / increase clarity  is to simply start by going track to track and listening for / EQing out non musical resonances and non-musical buildups. \n\nI am definitely NOT suggesting the aggressive hyper notching you see in a lot of YouTube tutorials, but a general track to track cleanup of obvious issues. Don\u2019t over think it, only attack the obvious things \n\nHypothetical Examples:\n- weird 1.5k resonant ring in the hats and overheads\u2026notch that thing down a bit. You\u2019d be surprised how much space that takes up in a dense mix. \n- high lead guitar part with extraneous rumble at 200hz\u2026not contributing to the musicality of the part\u2026byeeee\n- piano building up at 300hz in the choruses when everything is competing for midrange - automate EQ in chorus to create space \n\n\nEtc etc etc. \n\nSmall moves like that have made some of the biggest differences for me. Definitely not the fanciest tip, but simple EQ moves have been the biggest contributor to midrange clarity for me.",

    "content": "@BoozleBAM This is a GREAT question, and having read the whole convo twice I don't think it was really answered. Honestly I probably won't be able to answer it either, but here are some thoughts in no particular order\n\nFirst the usual caveat, I'm not a mixer and I haven't mixed a record in a decade. But I did record and mix for 20 years before that and followed the whole arc from beginner not understanding compression, to pro finding my way and getting to own or use all of the baller dream hardware. All that to say I have a lot of empathy for where you are at with it. These are not definitive statements, just aspects to think about..\n\n1) First something of a hot take that I don't see represented online. IMO compression often makes an individual instrument sound \"worse\". If you play and record something like drums well or acoustic guitar well, a compressed version will often sound *less real* and less vital. So why in the world would we do it???\n\n- The first reason is that we mostly don't care about how individual instruments sound, we care about the whole song. Often a compressed sound will play nicer in an arrangement than something dynamic, real and recorded in a \"documentarian\" way\n\n- The second reason is a trade off that isn't often spoken about. Compressed instruments often translate better into the wild. Take a beautiful, dynamic, real sounding, hifi & documentarian recording of say upright bass, drums and acoustic guitar. Listen in your studio in great monitors and it's a dream. Now go to Target and play it in mono on the overhead speaker on a busy saturday.....it just won't survive ... the song gets lost. Or drive with your window open, or cook dinner with the AC on etc etc.",

A buddy of mine just listened to a rough of a rock song im doing with one of my favorite bands and he\u2019s like \u201choly shit this song should just be called \u2018Toms and Heavy Guitars\u2019\u201d and it felt like mission accomplished. I\u2019m so bored by status quo, I want things to pop out at me, I want elements to be FEATURED. Mixing to me is less about \u201cdoes this hi hat have enough 5k\u201d and more \u201cwhat are the 3 most important things at any one time in the song and can I hear/feel them\u201d. There\u2019s a place for knowing how to eq or saturate properly but to me that\u2019s like wayyy behind knowing what\u2019s supposed to be the featured part of the track.

Don\u2019t be the first guy.   As a mixer I\u2019m not always going to agree with everyone\u2019s taste, but it\u2019s important to know how to do the tasks im being asked to do, I feel it\u2019s also important to for me to explain to the artist, when I\u2019m \u201cfollowing orders\u201d if you will.

    "content": "Hell yea. I'd start by having a relatively dry kit in a relatively dry space. The snare is tuned up pretty high but somewhat dead... avoiding the big 150-300hz fundamental that a lot of indie records are chasing these days. It's a very Nigel Godrich-y compression sound which is -- not really the sound of compression on the snare mic, but more on the kit as a whole. You'll notice that the whole kit, cymbals included, is really getting pressed up against whatever compression is happening. And to make that work, the drummer is playing very lightly... even on the heavier chorus sections. I'd probably start with a pair of 1176s or an 1178 strapped across the kit... medium attack and fast release (or heavier handed on a parallel bus) and you'll get that great snap from such a light touch.",

Great for commerce, kinda a bummer for creativity and art. \n\nSometimes a heavier hand with processing on the final mixbus can help those things gel a bit, to blur those lines.

    "content": "2) The first was a practical reason to compress, the second is more creative. Compression allows us to shape the envelope of sounds, by varying the attack and release and type of compressor we use (we'll come back to that). Why would that be useful? A few examples;\n\n- A fast attack allows us to tame the front of a sound, and set it back in an arrangement. Our ears are naturally drawn to shorter sharper transients, and that can be a lovely thing. But say for example I've got a bright and transient heavy acoustic guitar, it might be distracting me from the vocal and the story of the song, a fast attack and low ratio could allow me to \"set it back\" behind the vocal, without turning it down or darkening it too much\n\n- Another way we can use the envelope shaping is to bring out the body or thump in a sound. Take something like a bright snare crack, a compressor like a DBX160 will grab the front transient and soften it, and then the release curve will give the body and shell of the snare this chunky weight that can be really musical",

    "content": "In the acoustic guitar example this *is* what\u2019s happening, but with MS it\u2019s not *always* what happens.\n\nWith a single stereo source that has a strong in-phase center, MS tends to work more like you\u2019d expect from the words \u2018mid\u2019 and \u2018side\u2019.\n\nIn this case you\u2019re cutting the in-phase (summable) low mids from the M channel. What\u2019s left is the out-of-phase (difference) low mids on the S channel.\n\nLike Jonathan said, things get weird when you have different, un-centered content on L and R. A sound hard panned to the left or right will sum to mono AND create a difference between L and R, so it shows up equally in both M and S channels. Processing only the S creates incoherence from the M part of the source, which can have unintended effects when you sum back to LR. An extreme example being a panned tom with the fundamental ending up on the opposite side.\n\nIn my experience MS processing has the potential to be quite destructive on a stereo mix for this reason.",

It's partly a result of me feeling more assured in my choices, and partly me aiming to reduce the complexity of my sessions as I proceed through them. I hate large sessions.\n\nNothing is more demoralizing than that feeling of being in the final mix and still auditioning new kick drum samples at the final hour. I had a production/mix like that last year and it drove me crazy because nothing felt locked in. I had no fixed point in the mix to work from or to build off of.\n\nNowadays whenever I think to myself \"This _ feels great and like a finished record\" I will immediately commit it to audio to prevent myself from unraveling the work I've already done.\n\nI'm the type of person that if I saw a channel with twelve plugins on it I get suspicious and start paring it back to see if I can create the sound with less processing. Sometimes this is the right move, but if I start tweaking the compressor in the 2nd plugin slot that's downstream of 8 more plugins that's a good way to de-stabilize the entire sound you've built up. Committing sooner prevents me from unraveling too much of the audio.",

Mixes where things are locked in place sound more similar everywhere, they are in a sense robust. Mixes with braver dynamic or EQ choices can be much more exciting under ideal conditions, but do less well at the edges of the bell curve (mono overhead speaker at the supermarket for example)\n\nSerban\u2019s mixes are very locked in place, dynamically and from a frequency point of view and so he has great translation. I rarely find it to get in the way of the song, but some of my mixer friends will go to the mat about how it could have been so much more \u2026. And maybe they\u2019re right\n\nBut if you win the race, and the song comes through then how much more do you need to win it by? His mixes do the job of getting pop songs into my ears, and give A&R confidence and comfort, a lot to like \u2026",

    "content": "I used to do consistent audiobook work 15+ years ago to supplement studio work. It was brutal work and I hated it. RX didn\u2019t exist yet, or was in it\u2019s infancy and sounded terrible. I\u2019d record and edit, used an m930 because of the low self noise which was huge for me around the time. My editing trick was to make a 5 min room tone loop the length of the book, duplicate the dialog, strip silence one track, using the dup track as a trigger to extract silence for the other track with the room tone selected, delete the dup track. In object mode select all the audio then it\u2019s something like shift + drag to fill the gaps from strip silence with the extracted room tone. Always used beat detective to do batch cross fades. Then listen through and correct to taste. RX declick would have been a game changer back then but I did all that shit by hand, if there was a pop on a word you\u2019d aim to find a similar syllable somewhere else to replace it with. At the time I was getting paid $250/finished hour for editing and $300 for tracking which was really good considering I could edit around 1.5:1 but tracking was always closer to 3:1. Budgets started shrinking right around the advent of RX. When I started, there was always an engineer, producer and proofer in the room for tracking. All lunches paid for. After enough experience I was able to provide all three which made it pretty lucrative. But the industry changed and eventually it was just engineer and reader which put a lot of pressure on the engineer to produce and proof. The  publisher I worked with stopped paying for lunch then dropped my fee to $250/$200 then $225/$175 then $200/$150 and once it hit $175/$125 I saw the writing on the wall and vowed never to do it again. I will say it upped my Pro Tools keyboard speed tremendously and kept my studio afloat early on. The halycon days of audiobook production are long gone as far as finaces are concerned.",

There are mixes that I listen to that are empirically good (Nice To Meet ya by Megan Trainor comes to mind). It's a Jon mix and it bangs. But the song sucks. Says nothing. Completely forgettable. But it crushes the air coming out of the speakers. There are songs that I love that have terrible mixes. The first Beach House album is one of my desert island records... but technically, it sounds like they stuck an Mbox in the microwave. A lot of great cooking analogies to be had, but if mixing is like cooking, you can still have a bulletproof recipe, completely mess up the cook, and somehow end up with something delicious (Pizza, Macaroni and Cheese, etc). But then when you get Thomas Keller in the kitchen, the food will really sing, and you'll taste things you've never tasted, and feel emotions you didn't know you could feel.

You can create a lot of space in your mix by reducing all but a few key elements to mono. Keyboards and synths are a huge offender here.\n\nA lot of mixers/producers assume that the instruments need to be stereo, when in fact it's the *mix* that should be stereo. And the most \"stereo\" mix is often created by panning mono instruments in the stereo field. Getting those pan balances right is going to remove a lot of conflict between instruments sharing similar frequency ranges.\n\nYou can still have stereo reverbs and echoes, but they can often be far more narrow than the default setting of 100% width. So don't overlook narrowing your stereo elements too.\n\nIt's amazing how much you can do with nothing but faders, pan knobs, and EQ.",

After going back and forth and comparing for a while and taking breaks, I liked the LCD-X the least, just sounded weird and unnatural to me in the mid range, LCD-5s were my second least favourite which was surprising. I found Hats and things in that range had a really weird un-natural sound to them.. not sure how else to describe it. Just not for me. The Clear MG and MM-500s both sounded great, altho when i listened to some \"thicker/warmer\" mixes i'd done on the Focals, it felt like I would have scooped my mix too much if i'd been on them, because they were pretty full sounding/a bit boomy in the low mids/bottom, where the mixes sounded how i intended on the MM-500s. If i was buying with the intent to use them for production, or as a secondary reference, i'd probably go with the clears because they sound fun and were really comfy, have a bit more high end and bottom end.. but the mannys seemed flatter/sounded more natural in the bottom and top and more like what i'd want to hear while mixing i think.  Found a pair of demo MM-500s for a slight discount and pulled the trigger on them just now. Can followup in a week to see if after trying to mix on them i have buyers remorse or not \ud83d\ude02",

Four on the floor is actually really hard to get right, especially under the microscope of a multi mic\u2019d scenario where the low end can vastly change depending on how hard the drummer is hitting. If you hit a kick or snare a little too hard or if the drummer is flamming their kick and snare hits, it can choke the drum, kill the low end, and maybe present itself as being out of phase. But if flipping the phase is solving the issue, I guess it is phase related, which is interesting. \n\nFWIW, if it is performance related and I know the artist is down for me to be surgical, sometimes I\u2019ll just fly a good hit from the previous bar to replace the one that was flam\u2019d or choked or sounds out of phase. I know this doesn\u2019t work for every scenario, and some drummers might hate that if they found out, but I find that usually does the trick for me and blends in really naturally to a performance.",

When you learn to do it and to hear it, you learn why it's so important (pulling low end plosives out of a vocal so it doesn't pin the compressor, for example). From there you learn how and when to break it (I like boosting the 200hz-ish body of a live snare drum into a parallel compressor/ saturator to solidify and have control of that frequency range, automate it for fills, etc.).\n\nIMO this is a great \"rule,\" which is great to learn and then break all the time.",

    "content": "- The classic example of compression is to use a fast release with something like a parallel drum buss. As the release lets go and brings up the room gain you get this urgent and explosive energy. When the room is good, and the compression timing is set right it can really make things sound bigger than real life. Remember we're trying to tell a story here, we can't jam the *actual* real power and size of stadium rock drums into that mono speaker at Target but listen to Paradise City and it tells the story pretty well ... our brain does an amazing job of filling in the rest\n\n- The last example is using something like a good tube compressor on vocals. With a nice soft knee and lots of gain reduction we get bring up a bunch of low level and emotional detail, breathy whispery stuff at the end of lines etc that can really help a lyric connect. Often with something like a good tube compressor we get a healthy amount of harmonic distortion too along for the ride which adds weight to the vocal and draws the listeners attention",

    "content": "sam and i were DM-ing separately about this too, but I'm copying a message I shared about why I like to trigger in samples from the same kit/session if anybody cares to chime in... \n\n*\"many different answers to this based on what you're working on but i'll use today's mix on my end as an example. mixing the audio for a live in studio recording of an artist that is quite pop, but tours with a tight band that makes the music much more live. Wanting this to be a hybrid of the two sounds, not a live show and not a spotify release but somewhere in the middle, so I premixed the snare/kick/tom samples and triggered them in. My favorite element for this is that I can work with the overheads in addition to the close mics and sculpt those to fit each drum. For example, the toms I'm blasting the overhead with tape saturation that is giving them a nice airy attack. then when I trigger them in, I'm essentially getting that tone from the overheads without applying that processing to the entire overhead mix (which has loads of cymbals). If most of my snare tone was coming from just close mics, I wouldn't care as much about triggering it would just be more for a consistent sound. but since I can sculpt the overheads so distinctly for each drum, it's making a much bigger impact on the mix to use these samples. additionally, i'm triggering in the kick and snare from the original track, which are kind of pop/electronic sounding, and just blending them in enough to get the attitude of the studio version.\"*",

But generally my approach might look something like this: First pull down the volume by a bunch. Then usually you\u2019ll want to add in some transients back again. I like Spiff for this to taste. Then sometimes Master Rebalance by Ozone can be a life saver. Especially if say the balance of some instruments are clashing with the vocal or the 808/bass is too loud in relation to everything else. Essentially I\u2019m \u201cunlimiting the beat\u201d. \n\nThen together with the vocal in the mix I\u2019ll try to shape the beat around the vocal with some subtle (usually reductive) eq moves. Something like dynamically sidechaining a bell on the hihat frequencies to the vocal can help a lot. Or I might also play with Spectral Shape. Some people get good results with sidechaining the vocal as a whole with trackspacer or soothe. Then if I\u2019m missing some super lows or excitement I might throw a Pultec/Bax-type EQ or Spectre on it. \n\nSo ultimately I\u2019m creating as much space as possible and give myself enough headroom to still do some typical mixbus moves.\n\nTo me this removes the need to do anything different on the mixbus.

I was pretty happy with the results in the end though, pretty imperceptible after everything went through the vocal mix chain.Took ages but it was a good ear training lesson. \n\n@jantrit \u2018s recipe above is a good methodology\n\n*Went back and dug it out, it was second verse of this track - 1:58 \"a lot to learn, a lot to earn\" was recorded on iPhone https://open.spotify.com/track/2yhKDrTVMCLBWYd0aIfOfy?si=1a2914797e6843d8\n\nIt's got a low double and the FX are such a part of the character; it's a context that allows this tomfoolery.\n\n\nIncidentally, just remembering some other stuff around that record. It was produced by Philippe Zdar (that particular edit was made less than two weeks before his tragic death), and I remember the stems coming in with all of their character baked in. Wouldn't say it's the band's best album, but some of the parts were awesome.\n\nA bass guitar came in with the hihat baked in to it, so I dutifully went back on emails asking for them separated, but that was how he'd printed it - they were sharing some piece of gear, and for whatever reason that's how they had to go down. Mark Ralph was mixing it, and at the time I might've had a bit of a \"huh, Zdar's supposed to be a professional, why is the hi hat on the bass channel\" sort of bullshit attitude, but that particular instance cleared that right out. Mark's response to anything like that was always pure acceptance and understanding that people work how they work and it's his job to do what he can with whatever he receives.",

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

In this situation you can\u2019t get to the vocal because you don\u2019t have the track, BUT if you\u2019re mixing, you can reach for the vocal and boost a narrow Q at 1500hz to accomplish the same task but in a cleaner way.\n\nThis is the type of reason I might reach for M/S, I don\u2019t reach for M/S if guitars need to be brighter on the sides, I find the guitars on the sides in my mix, and make them brighter.\n\nThis is also the same reason to argue against multiple bus processing, because if the ability to use such a processor is there, we will use it, take away a bus and we have to work harder to get the mix done, but the end result can be much more effective, impactful, dynamic, and inspiring, but it takes longer and requires a lot more finesse.",

Starting with the biggest section of the song helps as well. I can then automate the other sections up or down *including the master fader feeding the 2bus*  As far as clipping/limiting on sources/busses I find it good to shape the sounds how I want (more heavy lifting) then the busses/2bus end up just glueing it together with a lighter touch.

He was driving a jeep with the doors and top off, and he was hit by a guy running a red light. He wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt and basically the way the person hit him made the Jeep fly out from under him and he landed straight down on the street unscathed, like a cartoon. Not wearing a seatbelt saved his life.\nIt would be dumb to hop on a car forum and not pushback with context if he were to go \u201chey guys, not wearing a seatbelt is the way to survive a car wreck\u201d.",

I just found it interesting that all these mixes that I've idoloized and resonated with for so long had things that, to me, were glaringly imperfect... Back to my 3-day old wine. Thanks, guys!",

I used this for a drum buss yesterday and it was super neat. \n\nFor me if im wanting a slammed buss sound I\u2019m typically gaining down all drum mics that aren\u2019t shells as I lean into the compressor. This let me instead trim up the shells post compression to the same effect. I then messed with just the oheads & crotch feeding the detector to see if the kick and snare was making stuff too pumpy.\n\nI\u2019m still wrapping my mind around this technique and I\u2019d be curious to hear some of you guys weigh in on how you\u2019ve found sidechaining effective in a live drum buss format!",

I love the way MAAT Santa Cruz does this ever so smoothly. \n2. I compress the bass with a compressor sidechained to a LPF(!), to get some low end body which is usually severely lacking. The LPF is set between 1000-2000 hz, attack 0-8 ms and release 200-400 ms depending on the tempo of the song/bass part. Reducing 3-5 dB on peaks. This gets me really far.\n3. If the bass is a shortscale, I\u2019ll use Goodhertz Tiltshift to move the low mids from around 200 hz to around 100 hz, out of the way of the guitars. \n4. Then I put an amp emulation on the channel. Whichever one floats your boat. Plugin Alliance B15, Guitar Rig, TSE BOD, whatever. I\u2019ll be boosting low end and cutting high end here, or before with a separate instance of Tiltshift. \n5. If I want the bass to sound \u201erock\u201c and cut, I send it to a parallel distortion, which can be anything. I like TSE BOD, which is another sansamp copy which  has a lot of sub. My trick here is to add a clipper before the sansamp to really get extra gnarl. Logic\u2018s stock Bitcrusher works great, but I\u2019m sure anything works.",

I often just copy one note that works into other parts that don\u2019t cut through but this stuff only works sometimes. It doesn\u2019t really work with busier bass parts\n\nAnd sustain wise, compression can help when it\u2019s done right or make it worse when it isn\u2019t done right. Same with saturation. I think with sustain, there\u2019s a lot of nuance in how you want the sustain to sit- performance is a huge part of this. Sometimes there\u2019s too much bright stuff and it doesn\u2019t allow the sustain to be audible, if you can tell something\u2019s down there but you can\u2019t really feel it or hear it that might be the issue. I noticed when there\u2019s too much or wrong compression on other upper elements, it becomes an issue. \n\nAlso dup the track and start new and see where you can take it, sometimes there\u2019s too much going on and hard to track what\u2019s causing what.",

Mute everything.\n2. Pull up kick in and out (+ sub or whatever they've recorded). Play with balance and phase of kick out until it feels good (good is context dependent - sometimes that's deep/subby/slow, sometimes that's punchy/percussive etc).\n4. Bring up overheads along with kick mics. Flip overhead phase and play with balance til it sounds cool, or punchy, or whatever you're after. Sometimes there's a very obvious right or wrong answer, but often just figure out whatever works for the drum groove + arrangement + song. Where the bass sits can often help tell you what config will work best.\n5. Solo snare mics, get them in phase with each other (just listen together and flip usually snare bottom until the blend sounds cool to you - often I'm looking for whichever configuration has more \"thud\", but that's context dependent). \n6.Unsolo and check snares against kicks and overheads. If you need to flip the snares, flip both top and bottom (or whatever combo) together so their relative phase remains intact. \n6. Add in rooms, again flipping and balancing til shit feels cool. Do same for crush mics, any other flavour stuff.\n\nToms are usually my last concern. Unless the groove is tom heavy, they might do only 2 or 3 hits across the whole song, so as Ryan said - hand gate those fuckers and deal with them once the general sound is dialled in.",

Super handy for lots of functions - either very precise and malleable gate open and close on the audible drums themselves, but also for instrument sidechains, maybe Pro-MB ext input on a bass track, a sine generator under the kick / noise generator on snare, the Slate Trigger feeds etc. \n\nHaving the gate triggers as audio allows you to slide them a couple samples back and forth as needed for groove or faux lookahead. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s easier ways to do things (it\u2019s a somewhat old school technique), but making them is one of my prep steps and they do get used in every session.",

It's wild.\n\nMy bandmate and I always used to joke about how she'd be up on stage simultaneously playing a synth with each hand, singing, dancing, and *still* have the mental bandwidth to be thinking about the laundry that she's gonna do when we get home. \ud83d\ude06 Flow states are wild.",

It can be jarring to the whole mix if you\u2019re gating the vocal, because the whole band jumps in level when the vocals start.\n\nEvery situation like this is different, and requires different solutions. In my case there was a lot of multing out vocals. Treating and eq\u2019ing different parts of the songs differently. Had a lot of luck using a very narrowly focused Soothe on the vocals sidechained to the overheads, but it takes a bit of work to figure where, how wide, and how much. When it works, it\u2019s awesome, when it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s really not.",

Sort of thing that could help define a cool kit sound in the absence of other mics. Often lots of usable smash stuff in rack tom mic in desperate times (as it sounds like you know!)\n\nAlso side story, I was at Battery one day and one of Flood\u2019s old engineers was being put through the ringer. He\u2019d mixed a song for Flood 3 times already, and each time he\u2019d send a version, Flood would be like \u201cthat\u2019s great. Okay now take out everything but the hihat mic\u201d and he\u2019d have to rebuild a new mix based on that.

I have the same preference as you and some things i\u2019ve tried to answer this note is- push midrange and cut bass a little on the drums. Lighten up on drum bus compression so the drums feel less intense and breathe a bit more, lean less on close mics and more on rooms, darken drums so that they feel further away and less present. There is joy to be had in learning to love quieter drums.",

    "content": "So I'm hearing two things: You're having difficulty knowing how to get what you want (over or under processing) and you're not feeling confident about the choices that you're making.\n\nIf you hadn't already mentioned it, my first thought would be to evaluate your monitoring because it sounds as if you're missing the mark that you're aiming at (over/under processing). But it also sounds like you are split on the target that you're trying to hit in the first place.\n\nWhen the production you're given to mix is lacking in some way - maybe the sonics aren't great, the arrangement isn't great, or the song is not great - there can be an urge as mixer to want to close that gap by delivering a killer mix. Sometimes we see that gap and think that we'll be able to make this record amazing and make up for it's shortcomings by crushing the mix. But there's only so far that we can take a song at the mix stage. Maybe the record will be great anyways despite some perceived issue.\n\nWhile there's always room for improvement take care that you're not putting all of that weight on your shoulders. By all means do a great job, but know when to stop chasing an unattainable goal. It's not necessarily something that you can resolve as mixer. So - if that's the case - make sure you're not demanding the world from yourself.",

    "content": "So, I\u2019m a long-time follower of this thread, but have been to scared to post any questions as I\u2019m afraid to look like a total dumb ass\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a singer/songwriter/guitarist who has been teaching myself how to record/mix over the past few years. I don\u2019t totally suck, but I have a long way to go.\n\nI\u2019m working on a mix for a client\u2014yes that\u2019s new for me\u2014and I want to kill myself \ud83d\ude42\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a big, dumb rock song (I.e. Foo Fighters), and I can\u2019t for the life of me reign in the drums\u2014in other words, there\u2019s freaking cymbal bleed in EVERY mic. So, I have this situation where I tame the shitty cymbals\u2014then get something that sounds like kick and snare samples playing along to a vacuum cleaner. Mostly because I\u2019ve put every stinking plug-in like Soothe, multi-band compression and dynamic EQ on the overheads and rooms. Yeah! My cymbals don\u2019t poke your ears out\u2014but, they also sound like a Rumba.\n\nAnd gating did not work as the drummer is hitting his shitty cymbals on every freaking beat! I ended up sampling a god forgive\u2014clean snare hit and using that as a sample. It\u2019s okay, but without being able to raise the level of the rooms and overheads, I\u2019m kind of fucked.\n\nI found myself referencing this Joel Hamilton production/mix of a Highly Suspect song as it\u2019s kind of similar to what I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s on Puremix. He\u2019s pretty amazing. And while the music isn\u2019t my thing\u2014it sounds awesome. His mix sounds big and organic\u2014while mine sounds like an electric ham sandwich.\n\nWithout hearing the song, I don\u2019t know how much advice I can expect. I just mostly want to vent\u2026\n\nI sometimes wonder if I\u2019m the one that sucks, or is it the source material? When do you know you\u2019ve done the best you can with what you\u2019ve been given? You can\u2019t polish a turd. \n\nAnd as a newbie dipshit, I\u2019m trying so hard to make whatever I do be super awesome, badass\u2014whatever that means. But, maybe I just need to make the rough mix sound 20% better. I don\u2019t know.\n\nWow! That was long. Thanks for any advice\u2026",

I tend to buy plugins to save time when projects come in. \n\nIn the order I'd range these kind of tools mentioned here:\n\n1. soothe\n2. speccraft\n3. reso and all others\n\nIf you have soothe, you're good imo. \n\nI liked this one (speccraft) because it gave me more control when I needed to chase a more targeted frequency without affecting the rest (i.e vocals, bass gtr, etc), stuff like that, but I use these kind of tools sparingly. cymbals, egtrs cabs, things like that, almost never on the mixbus because IMHO (don't shoot me), soothe-like tools, affect too much of the signal - suppressing resonances/frequencies \"killing the depth\" because of the pushing down of reverbs, delays, etc. That is not to say I never use it, there are times for everything, and every tool has its place but yeah. There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

(logarithmic curve? opposite of an exponential curve) i don\u2019t know why this is. so say you have a kick drum at -3. you drag your hand down to move it to -4. easy. well that same physical movement would affect a very quiet track at -20 by probably 5-10 dB. you can see this in the print on the fader, the increments get larger as you get quieter. so trimming down -20 then being able to move in similar increments as a loud track is very very helpful.",

The track itself sounds good on a phone speaker, so it\u2019s not a phone issue. It\u2019s something to do with TikTok\u2019s encoding after it\u2019s been uploaded. \n\nAnyone have insight to the ways of TikTok?",

    "content": "For rock and folk music I generally just do subgroups like drums, bass, guitars, leads, bvs, lvs. For pop oriented songs generally more split out/ kick, snr, toms, hats, cymbals, fx, different synths split out etc. i just use soundflow scripts that solo and bounce what I tell it to and run it at night or at lunch. Freezing tracks first can make it go way faster. As for mixbuss, I take off my final limiter (or turn down the input, however the song was sent to mastering)\u2026 I\u2019m usually not compressing the buss hard enough for it to matter. Sometimes the sum of the stems ends up sounding better than the mix! Generally people are using them for their MD to create a live show, or for dance remixes etc. For sync most people seem happy with instrumental and accapella in my experience so far?  Also if your trying to key your mix buss compressor from a printed mix, freezing most of the session first (besides fx etc and aux tracks) seems to help the side chain feel pretty close to what the mix was. I don\u2019t bother with it though most of the time as I\u2019m doing a couple db at most on the buss comp.\n\nEdit: one other idea I\u2019ve messed with pre soundflow, is, if your just doing subgroups and have the routing setup, save your mixbuss as a track preset and when your ready to print recall it on all your masters and commit the tracks. It works for me unless im using too much uad etc.",

    "content": "Wow, i never knew that about rumours. Fascinating! i love that record.....the cymbals on dreams might be my fav cymbals of all time...., that\u2019s v interesting to me about it being off 440hz and brings the solfeggio frequencies to mind.....and the whole 440hz conspiracy/earth song malarkey. I remember seeing Chris martin discussing solfeggios and how he uses them sometimes in his composition (and how he is into alchemy).\n\nRe: hip-hop all sounding the same.\nI personally don\u2019t feel it all sounds the same at all but you need to be into the culture deeply to recognise all its different aesthetics........like in the US , the Memphis, Atlanta and Florida sounds are all very distinctive from the NY and LA sounds IMO...and in the uk i can hear the difference between east , west, north and south london styles....and we have drill and trap ....and then all the engineers involved create from different palettes imo ....eg. Gentmameshi vs mixedbyali (as one example)...big contrast, and i love them both. Mostly with hip hop now i think it gets called crap when people are being genuinely experimental sonically.....as its an aesthetic older generations aren\u2019t familiar with ...eg yeat, carti, sofaygo, trippie redd.....to me the super clipped, emo guitar, spinz 808 FL sound is punk. It\u2019s ugly and brilliant (and is only one aesthetic)",

    "content": "That is true, but I think a good mix still sounds bad in target \ud83d\ude05 and I\u2019ve been in enough bars and restaurants that have playback systems that sound worse than my iPhone in a bathroom only playing out the left speaker. \n\nAnd people will still say, \u201comg I love this song\u201d and start bouncing their head.\n\n I believe that great songs translate every and anywhere. But fidelity cannot IMO be appreciated in these specific places. \n\nOfc there are exceptions. But try eating at a restaurant on a beach promenade in south Spain and the restaurant next to you has a speaker 20 inches from your head blasting a different song. And tell me you think the vocal is warm or the drums are punchy. I think, sadly for general non music fans what they find in music, is less quiteness it\u2019s not even about the song. \n\nWhereas I think the people who enjoy music, will appreciate that extra punchy drum sound or warm vocal and deep bass. And I believe those people use headphones 80% of the time. They might have a great speaker system at home. But how much time do we really have at home listening to said speakers? Headphones are with us on the go all the time. Everyone I know under 30. Listens primarily on headphones. Or their iPhone speaker. Sometimes a JBL at the beach or park, and every now and then a party speaker at a party while drunk. The ones who really really love music, either have an old vintage speaker set from their parents or a Sonnos/smart speaker type thing. \n\nI still believe mixing for speakers is important, and @Nomograph Mastering has a great point in speakers translating to headphones easier than vice versa. But I always make sure shit sounds amazing on my AirPods. I\u2019d rather sacrifice something in the speaker than the AirPods. But then again. I don\u2019t have the accolades you do. So I might be shooting myself in the foot. But that is my general philosophy.",

The second mix \u201csounds better \u201c but the first \u201cfeels better \u201c , sort of just what ruari was talking about . I need to arrive the mix to a place where it has the best of both mixes but without what I think must be the (too ) altered phase relationships of the second mix . So , your  suggestion of the importance of doing the work with all elements in is \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc . I really want to have a much punchier cleaner mix than their rough to support what\u2019s really a messy song structure , but again \u2026taking care of the drum sound when there\u2019s a significant amount of spill across every mic , it\u2019s going to be an education in phase me thinks",

The \"absolute\" relationship between all microphones recording one drum will remain the same. Where things can get more complex is when drums are flaming...sometimes they add up in a pleasing way, sometimes they don't. When  the kick starts slightly ahead of the snare or vice verca it just adds up differently right? Live drums make complex tones and depending on the hit even the tone/pitch slightly changes. Lining up the hits (fixing the flams however you can make it work) changes the phase relationship. The most common thing I do is replace with a good (all lined up) hit when I can, or line them up. The phase flip mostly is done with bass notes (for me), but I 100% have found it to be a solution for some weird drum hit before....I attached a screen capture of some flams (from a really sloppy ccm recording)  just to help illustrate the potential problem.",

It begins sounding like you're standing in the audience watching him perform and it seamlessly melts away into a full studio production over the course of a few minutes. As if you closed your eyes at a show and when you opened them you're lying on the floor at home with headphones and have no recollection of how you arrived there.\n\nThere's this great blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when the live jazz kit seamlessly switches from being played to being programmed: https://open.spotify.com/track/5TwlEMyRImfmgDbXWNkRLd?si=72fb59fd9cef4fbb",

    "content": "I recently revisited a mix I initially did in 2021 for an as of yet unreleased project. A folk / rock / americana track. My OG mix had this really aggressive edge to it that I kinda liked but it also felt way too scooped in the low mids. I checked out my old session and turns out I had cranked a ton of 8khz on the mixbus (a move I haven't felt compelled to do since 2021). Related I've been really enjoying thick / dense / full bodied mixes that still have excitement / edge up top especially for vocals and I had previously struggled to achieve a similar 'heft' in my own mixes compared to what I was hearing. I think in the past I was too quick to zap low mid resonances in my vocals / guitars. So I've been experimenting cutting less down around 200hz-600hz and emphasizing more. But then I felt I was losing some of that edge / excitement by see-sawing too much with the low mids relative to up top. I've found cutting some 170hz clears much of that up for me (like oh hey there's my snare or more room for kick / bass), I achieve the thickness above in that 200-600hz range and balance that with the excitement around ~8khz. Pushing and pulling.",

In theory I get that you want to clip your transients to get them even and then maybe you can have exacting control over how much transient you actually want in a mix with the shaper post clipper, but I've yet to a find a situation where I'd ever want to bring back transient post clipping. Maybe that's because I'm mostly working in the live instrumentation / drum kit space where I'm basically trying to lessen the 20 dB+ of dynamic range on a kick or snare or drumkit at large. Shaving off 6 (or more!) dB of transient on a played snare drum still leaves you with a pretty transient rich snare drum. But I'm still curious about use cases...",

(i'll rewatch when they post it back up)  Its this cutting / scooping of the high mids (up at c.1-6khz) that ive never heard much about before, Im interested because i dont like crushing my mixes to get a higher lufs and if this is an effective way to get their smoothly im v interested in learning more....im happiest with my mixes at -12 lufs but will push to -9 ....but id like to get to -9 with as little sacrifice to the fidelity and low end as poss.\nIve also heard recently (I think i heard it from colin leanord talking) something about the trap guys always scooping out the  second octave harmonic   of the bass ? c. the 110-130hz region....Is anyone familiar with using this? (eg.  the  \"missing fundamental\" and all that good stuff)",

The drum stems they get aren\u2019t gonna add up to what I\u2019m hearing right? Because they\u2019re going to hit my drum bus compressor one by one?\n\nI think a good example is Disclosure sending Jon the stems for Talk. Guy always has a drum bus with Oxford Inflator, Saturn 2, and an API-2500. But when Jon gets the stems the drums are going to be individually compressed and thus not what Guy was actually hearing right?",

Also I\u2019ve had good luck taking that pitch envelope sine or triangle and throwing a volume shaper (I use Devious Machines Duck) and sidechain that to the kick in mic, play with the shape so that it doesn\u2019t interact with the transient, or print the whole thing to audio and play around with the timing so your sub is slightly behind the beat so your kick transient can still remain clear and your sub can bloom behind the transient.  Depends a lot on what your bass instruments are doing also but something to try!",

So I have been doing mixes completely ITB and when I stop getting a mountain of mix notes I begin to break things out to gear and summing. This most recent time I started sending things out, I noticed the center really get mangled. Specifically the kick and snare. Im wondering if sending out a stereo mix of the drums is just ruining the center image of the kit. The bass and vocals go out with a mono switch engaged so they are sitting fine. I prefer the solidness of the ITB mix at the moment. If anyone has gone down the rabbit hole of this and has some thoughts would love to hear it. Maybe I reached my zen moment of dialing in ITB mixing and I can sell some gear for taco money \ud83d\udcb0 \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

If you only want one part of it, gates/eq do a LOT. it's like having two mics in one track, it's interesting.",

I\u2019m curious what folks\u2019 methods are for using clipping and limiting from single sources, busses, to the 2 bus. \n\nI feel like part of my issue is not giving myself enough headroom for the louder sections of the song to develop into, but I\u2019m thinking that my problem is how I\u2019m perceiving the role of the 2bus limiter and how often I \u201cwant\u201d it to be triggered, and how much dynamic range needs to be controlled at the bus level beforehand\u2026 I aspire to be a wizard someday \ud83d\ude05\n\nThanks!",

Using a multiband volume shaper like this you can have the low end transient trigger an adsr just for the high end so you can get the bleed under control while letting the natural decay of the floor tom through across the downbeat where the ride/crash is",

At the mo finding the compromise between having the drum sounds speak in the right hz and then how this affects the phases of the other drum parts is the thing . Like to your snare example. Opening up the snare top on a mix I have atm, snare sounds waaaay more exciting , and now I\u2019ve got nasty hat frequencies and the snare in the overheads doesn\u2019t blend with the snare channel. I can see with this stuff how the difference between a great and a poorly recorded drum set seems to define what I can or can\u2019t do in the mixstage. That\u2019s my thoughts at the mo. I love it though. Lots to learn with the band stuff which is fun",

Original SSL mixes left and right channels with OR principle \u2014 basically the envelope is generated based on the strongest signal coming from either L or R channels. \n2. Some of the models suggest mixing left and right channels \u2014 essentially you get the average signal between channels which is then generates into an envelope.\n3. True stereo (or rather dual mono with a single set of settings) \u2014 which calculates envelopes for the left and right channels independently.\nSome SSL comp models have a switch to trigger between various modes, but if I understand correctly, none of the SSL original models have used true stereo (fully independant) sidechain processing.",

I\u2019ve tried limiting my drum bus, but it takes extreme limiting on the drum bus to have an effect on mix bus limiter (and I don\u2019t totally understand why). I guess I could try limiting drums/bass together, as maybe it\u2019s a phase issue with kick and bass adding together (talking live drums here, not programmed)\u2026 but any thoughts here are appreciated. \n\nSecondly, what range of limiting (aka -2 to -6db) are you guys doing on mix bus to have your overall mix at around-9lufs? I have been trying to only hit -2db of limiting on peaks for most of my mix, but have a really tough time accomplishing this and loudness. I love heavy/punchy low end, so maybe that\u2019s why.. \n\nI guess I have this idea/goal in mind that I should be able to make -9lufs mixes that are punchy with a lot of low end, while only hitting 2db of limiting, but it seems impossible.

Distortion / Saturation plays a big role..  \n\nSo limiting should be one slice of the pie when it comes to achieving level\u2026 the rest should be done within the mix with the correct EQ moves .

And turn up the bottom left \u201cdistortion\u201d to 2-3 db and notice what it does to the peak level out of the plug-in vs coming in\u2026 you\u2019ll notice it looks like it\u2019s been limited. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just smashing the transients down and maintaining or gaining perceived loudness at the same time.",

The song itself and the artist are dope (longtime 6lack listener here) .....but imo it could have been very mid if not mixed so well. I\u2019m v interested in the hats ...they sound unusual , and wondered if it was 6lacks or Jon\u2019s choice for the sound. I recall Jon on Just For The Record discussing his frustration with a bog standard/\u201cevery time sounds the same\u201d hihat approach by so many producers ....whilst he was doing a live mix stream.. These hats sound similar to what he tried on the mix on JTFR. Jon\u2019s defo right in pocket with the most anticipated releases in the culture over here in the uk atm. Fair play to him.",

There are certain situations that arise where it can be a little challenging to decipher the most appropriate response as you first encounter it . So hearing your story there helps add up the balance . It\u2019s a strange thing to put your heart and soul into a production / mix and then just see it wander off into a series of decisions that don\u2019t include your original intentions anymore . The message I am picking up on here from industry  stories / personal experience of yourself, ruairi, and both Matts is don\u2019t sweat it too much , get your head down and just keep working hard. Thanks again for your share and i do think your mix kicks harder . The kick and snare snap more and there\u2019s a little accented hat at the start of verse 2 , in your mix it touches the ear perfectly in the other mix it\u2019s just a bit of mush (no shade to manny frfr and it could have been the me just prefer your mix ) \u270c\ud83c\udffc",

They ended up mixing it themselves, but they did so many of the mutes and changes I did in my mix version.  When they released it they credited me as \"additional mixing by CK Koch\".  At first I was annoyed, but then I decided to listen to each version of the mix critically and try to see if I could understand what it is they possibly did not like about my mix, and what they were going for in their mix. I do feel my mix had light years more vibe and glue and just sounded like a record....BUT....their mix had a really airy top end that was way brighter than how I usually mix.  I think I actually tend to mix too dark, which I have come to realize is very likely because of my monitoring and room. I now see how that extra octave on the top really does add something I wasn't putting in there.",

If you know where the sweet spot of a compressor is on a drum bus for example, you can calibrate 0 on the VU meter to that sweetspot. then mixing into your compressor isn't such a guessing game every time (because you get the needle bouncing around 0, not too far under or not too far over). \n\ni use a digital one on the way out when i'm hitting my analog chain so everything goes out at the relative same level. i use an analog one on the way back in calibrated to a \"safe\" level and i know when it's coming back in ultra hot or i need a little extra gain to get it to the sweet spot. when you're monitoring stays at a consistent level, VU meters can help you judge relative relationships quite easily. i could see it being useful in the use case you described if you've calibrated the VU accordingly. say you want to generally hit -10 at the mixbus...calibrate a -10 signal to 0 on the VU. everything you then feed into the mixbus will show on the VU + or - where you want to end up.",

    "content": "I use an Analog VU meter on the output of my monitor controller built by the inhouse tech who also worked at Neve (he designed and built the 8816 summing box) - he recommended the Sifam ones because their ballistics are really good - which I think is the main argument for analog vs digital. I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

On some hits, it sounds way better when the phase is reversed on the snare. I will post an exemple when I am done this mix \ud83d\ude42",

    "content": "I think this is important to realize WHY this is working. The polarity flip is making the drums (as a whole) sum the waveforms in a more pleasing and additive way. \nThe way I theorize this is happening is because while all of the drum mics relative phase relationships remain the same, the frequencies that the drums produces slightly vary during a performance. These are NOT one shot samples going through the microphones. The 4 on the floor makes it much more complex because BOTH the snare and the kick are producing different tones (with variances) at the same time\u2026The frequencies that are additive (in-phase) are relative to all of the drum mics positioning/distance from the source, BUT different frequencies will add/subtract in magnitude\u2026that is what we are quickly checking with polarity. If you change the tuning on a snare drum for instance, it can start to become less \u201cin phase\u201d with the overheads because the fundamental frequency has changed and may not be complimentary between the OH/SN mics anymore at the same distance.",

I mixed the whole thing in one Pro Tools session, with a separate set of channels for each song which I\u2019d then make inactive and move onto the next song. When printing the continuous mix at the end, I\u2019d make active two songs at a time for any overlap, and constructed the long printed mix like that.\n\nIn this case though, there are multimiced drums, bass, electric guitars, keyboards, vocals. The recordings are good (from the stereo board mixes I\u2019ve heard) and the scale is such that I want to have the fidelity I\u2019d approach a studio record with, and the room to shape an identity for each song (while still sounding like they all happened on the same stage on the same night) so I\u2019m thinking to use my usual elaborate drum mix routing with parallels etc, all the bells and whistles.\n\nThis complexity would put me off mixing 23 songs in one session, but I\u2019m thinking of the inevitable crunch at the end of the project and the potential frustration of jumping between sessions.\n\nAm I thinking too deeply about this?

    "content": "Hey everyone, I have a question about your approaches to mix prep when receiving stereo files of things that should be mono (for some reason happens to me a lot when I'm sent tracks from Logic). At the moment I usually import everything and then go through each track flipping polarity on one side or sometimes with a vectorscope. And will then split to mono accordingly and delete the extra channels and adjust volume if necessary and it feels like a pretty inefficient process. Was wondering if anyone uses something like  StereoMonoizer or has a better option. Also curious if it even matters. I find something inherently wrong about seeing a kick drum mic on a stereo track but I currently work completely in the box and other than giving me a minor headache when I look at it, I can't tell if there's any real downside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is now also making me think more about bus settings. I typically default to stereo busses but am wondering if I should use mono ones for mono sources (for example when I use a folder/bus to combine snare top and bottom or kick in and out to a single channel). Again, probably doesn't make a meaningful difference but curious what you all do. Thanks!",

But honestly who listens in mono anymore?\u201d\n\nHe reminded me a lot of small Bluetooth speakers are in mono, so I decided this morning to take a fresh look at a tune I\u2019m producing/mixing, starting in mono. \n\nThe leveling choices totally broke down when I switched to stereo, but I think the mix is much better and it happened faster cause I was forced to look at the eq in relation to the center elements, so even when I spread them back out there was more room for the vocal kik snare bass to speak. \n\nY\u2019all ever start a mix in mono? Or work with mono as a tool for extended periods?",

It\u2019s basically a group volume ride for frequencies instead of tracks. You can also do this on individual stereo tracks if just panning isn\u2019t granular enough. \n\nThe why & when is mostly about taste. I tend to mix into a proQ3 setting that has the sides hi passed around 100 for the same reason I have a pultec boosting highs & lows on the master- it just ends up doing a lot of work for me.\n\nIt can become problematic if I\u2019ve got big toms in a song and, after I\u2019ve got a mix starting to cook I\u2019ll toggle it on & off to see if I\u2019m doing more harm than good. For the kind of music I mostly do, it works more often than not, but the one song I sent to Cian for mixing he basically blasted me for doing that. (In his own kind and gentle way.)\n\nBut m/s eq isn\u2019t just for the master buss. You can think about it for any stereo track. Sometimes, I have an acoustic that\u2019s carrying the whole song, but the fundamentals are fighting with the vocal, so I\u2019ll turn the mid down at that frequency (or side chain that to the vocal if it feels anemic when the vocal is out.) that leaves the sides as big as you like cause it\u2019s not fighting with my mono vocal.",

Most sat around -10 to -12. Ava had the lowest ldv, possibly in favor for the stronger drums. On most tracks the RMS sat at -20.\n\nBGV. The bgvs include to many different types of elements to draw any conclusion but they all had overall RMS between -21 and -25.",

I actually seem to remember using the free Klanghelm green compressor thing (https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/DC1A) in parallel to great effect once. I made a parallel track of the snare, high passed it to hell so that it was just a \"tick,\" then compressed with the Klanghelm. Was one of the greatest most natural sounding snares I ever got. MIght've combined it with a clipper also, but I generally like to avoid clipping and such if I can - even compression, honestly!",

So ,im ditching gullfosses and soothes and spectral shapers and MB's..and im breaking my buses out to h/w mixers and boxes so that i can hopefully induce some electromagnetic phenomena or some \"accidental\" errors , like  my two year old coming in and turning knobs on the gear without me seeing (as he does) and then i mix through it , unknowingly....and ive introduced something wrong, something a perfect alogirthm could never give me ....something........difffffferent. Im v. bored atm with listening to perfect productions and mixes. Imho they are delicious and tasty and  malnourishing like McDonalds.\n\nImho, the sound of  Robert Johnson recorded, singing crossroads in a shack somewhere a 100 years ago will still outlast the bombastic incredibly perfect production/mixes i feel encouraged to mimic today. i feel like perfection has been overdone at this point. Lets f things up\n\nit might be a naff idea but , where im at....since doing band stuff....that tom elmhirst quote about there being no perfect mix....and the mix is the mix that happened at the moment where eevryone in the room agreed was it......and not to be touched again...this is what im fascinated with at the mo....and doing the print with me and the drummer on my current mixes pushing the analogue faders (with the busses stemmed out of the daw) together.

As a tracking engineer are you flipping polarity and then printing the drum stems with the polarity switched? As a mixing engineer when you get the drum stems are you moving your tracks to line up the phase? If so are you using the snare as your reference point to line everything up?",

When the kick is fed to a compressor on your 808 channel - the compressor \u201clistens\u201d to the kick and applies the compression curve from the kick onto the bass.\n\nSo in your case of printing stems with a mix bus compressor - you want the SPL Iron plugin to \u201clisten\u201d to the entire mix as it heard it before but then apply that compression to one track at a time.\n\nWe can do this in Ableton with some clever workarounds, which would be a lot more efficient to show you on a video call on the server if you are free later.  Essentially you need to print a version of your song at each point in your mix bus chain where there are dynamics plugins (just before the Slate plugin, just before the Iron Compressor but after all the other plugins) and then send that audio to those corresponding plugins\u2019 external sidechain inputs and then you can use the \u201cinclude return and master effects\u201d and get the result you are looking for",

There\u2019s also lots of discount codes I\u2019ve used . Metric halo , Goodhertz etc . Like Edward said , the andy Wallace vids are just incredible . Like four of them about 3 hours long each ? The Steve albini 3 hours on recording vid , like iwan said the CLA ones do really demonstrate the importance of balance . Personally love the Al Schmitt ones . All my verb set up was a copy of his verb sends . Tom Elmhurst is great , and Andrew Schepps ones are great . The Billie eilish James Bond song is epic , the hand zimmer ones .

The point Josh makes here in regard to being careful of the time / phase relationships of drum multitracks between close and middle distance / room mics (due to distance travelled of the signal to each mic )  is pertinent to where I\u2019m at at the moment. I\u2019d seen jacquire king discussing how he\u2019s looking to have his transients on his drums and bass all hitting on the positive phase of the signal so he can insure he has his signals  pushing and pulling the speakers in unison and not trying to push and pull at the same time . I\u2019m still wondering how I can really achieve this if I\u2019m allowing a few milliseconds phase delay between my kick close mics on the multi track .",

Last thing, I\u2019d suggest finding the mic with the best tone and building around that. sometimes people mix just the close mics and let the bleed create that glue.

I just needed to be careful with my EQ, and in the case of this song, appreciate that weird shit going on with the drums did not distract one bit from how much the song made me want to start some shit (a good thing, in this case). What DID distract from that feeling was all the inane technical crap I was trying to force on it. This isn\u2019t always the way, but these days I\u2019m really trying to listen for opportunities to think like this and put it into action. Long story long I\u2019m guessing at least some of this bleed is actually a non-issue and you might be laser focusing on it, as I am often prone to do.

Every extra minute spent on trying to iron it all out there will save you hours in editing and mixing. I\u2019ve often considered selling a piece of gear and then had a really stellar vocal go through only to realise there was nothing wrong with the gear. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of reading it but the performance is everything. You can\u2019t REALLY EQ air and body into a vocal that isn\u2019t there. You can\u2019t try simulate it alright. And you can\u2019t create actual excitement with compression, just try and trick the brain into thinking there\u2019s excitement. A 57 into any preamp into any interface with a stellar performance will sound amazing. \n\nAfter that is just treatment, and it\u2019s essentially pointless discussing chains because it\u2019s so song and vision dependant. \n\nA boring answer I know but you\u2019ll save a lot of headache and heart ache the sooner you learn it. \n\nIt\u2019s like when you hear a new compressor plugin just explode a drum room and it sounds amazing. Analogue glue, explosive release, so much groove.

I'm telling you some of these people will tell you what's wrong with the \"filter\" but won't notice the kick is panned left, so I hardly doubt the artists, mush less listeners, notice the lack of clicks  pops, gain automation, just right amount of sibilace, and just enough tuned vocals. What they do notice is that \"it slaps\". \n\nWe've just had an indie artist break through the market here. From hundreds of monthly listeners to hundreds of thousands. Dude must've recorded the music on his phone and mixed it himself. I'm purposefully omiting the word \"master.\" And well, the listeners do not care and still consume the melody and the lyrics, so I don't know what would have to happen for people to appreciate sonic quality per se",

I think ive heard of people using certain compressors to like add attack to the beginning of consonants and stuff like that.

    "content": "Hi there, new here \ud83d\ude42 \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f I\u2019ve been getting more into mixing lately, especially trying to understand transients better. A lot of stuff online focuses on transient shapers, but those are mostly just volume tweaks. What I\u2019m noticing when I\u2019m sound-designing is that transients also feel super tied to little bits of pitch movement. Like, if I make a kick with a soft pitch sweep, it hits way less, but if the pitch shift is more obvious, it feels way punchier. I also saw a video showing that Skrillex snare trick: duplicate the snare, pitch up an octave, chop it so only the short transient stays, then layer it back on top. And yes it slaps. So what do you think about that? If you use a transient shaper to change the shape of a sound over time and then compress it again to tame peaks, what\u2019s really the point? Sorry if that sounds basic, I\u2019m still learning \ud83d\ude4f",

    "content": "That's interesting...   is there a cubic volume or minimum length that aligns \"small drum room\" relative to schroeder frequency? Reading about SF right now, and it seems to be the cut-off point where room modes occur below that. The smaller the room the higher the cutoff point, and that's when the snare/tom fundamental frequency gets blurred by room modes?",

    "content": "But the essence of the situation is that when your fundamentals and octave harmonics on each drum (sometimes 3rd and 4th harmonics on the lowest drums too) all have +-25dB swings, stuff gets tricky. You can kind of account for it on each close mic but hard to solve for it on a comprehensive kit capture (e.g. a pair of overheads)",

    "content": "Yeah I'm with this... overheads rarely feel like a good perspective of the kit to me. I'm always leaning more on a closer room mics or some sort of mono kit / front of kit to give me that feeling of the drum set as a single instrument. If I'm tracking I'm always giving myself a few different options around the kit closer to the shells for that and using the overheads as a way to give clarity or weight to the cymbals if they feel too washy.",

If you're reffing against something that has more room in the time domain for a huge pushed kick drum, you may feel disapointed by yours, when it's not lacking. I find this more relevant with programmed/electronic drums and bass. I'm talking vastly different tempos not 1-5 bpm.",
