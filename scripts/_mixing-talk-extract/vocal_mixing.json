Not \"download my e-book\" guys. This space is a rare resource and a gift in the world we work in, and it's not always going to confirm your opinion. I don't post every day because I don't always have something to say or to add value, but I do gain a beautiful new perspective on a subject from reading through here at least a few times a week that I wouldn't have had the thought of without this space.\n\nIf you're gonna go after this job for real, you're gonna have the craziest shit thrown at you from clients, collaborators, peers and heroes that you've ever heard. \n\nYour feelings will not be protected when you operate in this industry at a professional level. \n\nSo, learning to take it on the chin and ask \"what is there to learn here?\" in a moment you're challenged is what will make you grow and be resilient. \n\nI just re-printed a stem an hour ago for a background vocal I fucked up \"fixing\" the timing of in the chorus. The client was incredibly direct and insensitive of my feelings about it, and if I hit them back to argue what was \"technically correct\" based on the grid and subdivisions I was looking at, and why I was right, they wouldn't care. They wanted it different, so I saw it through their lens of how they wrote the part and corrected it to deliver for the artist. And you know what? That result was better than my feeling of what was \"technically correct.\" They were right. A beautiful reminder to serve the song rather than to check the box. \n\nThe older I get the more I equally trust my taste and remain open to learning something based on new information. Adopting that mindset will only serve you in the process of experimentation of self and collaboration with others.",

It's more that everyone is chopping, clip gaining, and RXing to an evenness that softens and linearizes performances. \n\nThese tools work beautifully when shitty mic technique makes things boomy, or there's a few weird ss's on the pre-hyped TLM mic through the focusrite pre.\n\nBut it sounds like most people who learn the tools are overusing them like crazy. \n\nI'm trying these days to get off the details and try as much macro-mixing as possible.

The artist and I met and listened to some of the tunes and we chatted about sonic direction. Upon my first listen I had some specific ideas of where to go with the mixes, in particular with the vocal sounds.  On the first day of mixing I still felt the same way about notes I had made. After about a couple hours of mixing I found myself taking a left turn from the original direction I had in mind and I stopped and chatted with the artist and I felt the music was taking me elsewhere and was surprised where we ended up.  Luckily the artist was chill and also felt the same way and we were psyched where we ended up.  This was a reminder to myself that the music usually tells you what works and what doesn\u2019t and just because you have an idea doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what the track wants. This is what I do love about in person mixing, we all have ideas and you don\u2019t know if they are any good until you try them.",

Any clown (not referring to you) can find out from Colt Copernicus on YouTube how to widen their mix\u2026 the thing to me that sets the pros apart is knowing if it should be done. \n\nRuairi talks a lot about mastering engineers giving the artist and label confidence that the record is DONE, cause it\u2019s gone through his hands. It\u2019s not just that Ruairi has great ears, he knows what those ears are supposed to be listening for. (I remember this idea crystallized a bit for me when Noah mentioned when we did a song together I was looking to achieve things in the vocal that he hadn\u2019t even considered yet, rather than us just agreeing if it needs 5k). I send songs to Cian not because I want to make sure it still holds up on his garbage speakers, but because I want his input on whether we were right to have the vocals out front or the drums destroyed or whatever. And I feel like he has the confidence to (gently) suggest that maybe we missed the forest for the trees in 3 months of production and THIS keyboard line should be the thing that carries the chorus.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the wider conversation of what are we trying to bring to the table? Do we want to just do whatever we can to have our name on as many things as possible, or do we want to be the kind of artist/producer/mixer whose involvement actually matters, even if that j evolvement is \u201cyeah, you got it mostly right, just bumped up 60hz a bit not because I\u2019m lazy but because I genuinely think the rough works\u201d",

I think a lot of people have touched on it here, but at least for me there was no \u201cthis blog\u201d or \u201cthis YouTube\u201d, which in some ways is a bummer, but it\u2019s also liberating. Truthfully EVERY SINGLE PROJECT I do, to this day, I learn something new on. And my workflow is just the accumulation of all those different little moments. For instance, this last matt Maeson live record thing, there was a cymbal bleed problem that led me to figuring out how to use soothe on the vocal mic sidechained to the overheads to duck specific frequencies. I\u2019ll use that technique more often from here on out, and I shared it with the group here to maybe help someone else take a shortcut the next time.\n\nEVERY blog has given me an insight or two, even if it\u2019s a Streaky video where I go \u201cwell shit I DONT wanna do that\u201d. There\u2019s a million different water stations along the route of this marathon, rather than one big firehouse around mile 10. \n\nSecond, this thread feels like a good place to remind everyone that mixing is a people business; you\u2019re literally hired to make sure someone is pleased at the end of the process. Learning how to debate/take or givecriticism/get or give notes without coming off as a dick is quite possible the single most valuable lesson. No matter how good your 26hz is if people don\u2019t want to work with you you\u2019re not gonna have much of a career.",

Your client may be an idiot, but if you let them steal your joy that\u2019s on you. \n\nI\u2019m 109% giving myself this advice rn btw.\n\nI produced a song for a Disney artist this week and was STOKED on the direction. Took it from a sensitive guitar vocal to a smacking neo-disco vibe track, and she loved it, but wanted to change the chords and arrangement of the verses to go from lovely to nasty. Deep breath,  channeled all that shit Cian and Matt talk about all the time and treated it like a puzzle to solve. Interpreted the notes not as a repudiation of my ideas but an opportunity to try some shit. Did a save as and went hard, legit made her cry over a Listento stream cause she was so excited. All because I chose curiosity over judgement. \n\nTl;dr: Ted Lasso that shit. \n\nOne other thought- when someone comes at you with that kinda energy, it\u2019s ALWAYS a story they\u2019re telling about themselves. THEY feel insulted, they feel insecure, and your bad ass mix just reminded them how imposter they feel. So if you came back with love and patience and excitement to find the thing they\u2019re missing, not only will their attitude change, you\u2019re gonna be grateful cause 90% of the time when a client tells you there\u2019s something wrong, they\u2019re right.

Don\u2019t be the first guy.   As a mixer I\u2019m not always going to agree with everyone\u2019s taste, but it\u2019s important to know how to do the tasks im being asked to do, I feel it\u2019s also important to for me to explain to the artist, when I\u2019m \u201cfollowing orders\u201d if you will. And if  I\u2019m  feeing l it\u2019s not making the mix feel better to explain what I\u2019m hearing and why I feel it\u2019s taking a step backwards. This is a tricky  balancing act, as you don\u2019t want necessarily have a lengthy conversation about every mix note. But I\u2019ve found that  when I\u2019m not feeling a particular note,  the artist isn\u2019t necessarily hearing how  this particular move is affecting the whole pie. So usually will say something like \u201c that\u2019s great that the  snare is brighter but it also making the guitars and vocals feel\nBrighter too, maybe we should find some relief somewhere.\u201d  And they usually say,\u201d oh shit I didn\u2019t even notice that, let\u2019s do that or let\u2019s not brighten the snare\u201d.   The artist hired you for your experience so I feel it\u2019s my role to bring these things up and let them be the decision makers. And they will feel your support through this process. This will most likely lead to returning artists and recommendations. Checking out and following orders and responding with.  \n\u201cIs this what you want?

We were in this sweet spot after I graduated out of assisting him and before we got sick of being a room together... so I got to be a lot more hands on. The files came in *roooughhh*. Eric's response was simply \"it has to sound great, they're paying us a ton of money\"... so everyone in the studio divided and conquered... I replayed the bass and some drum stuff, Eric replayed a lot of the guitars, we both added to the background vocals. The parts were all bone headed but it made such a huge difference sonically to be working with real sounds as opposed to the demo recordings that got greenlit by the label. I think Eric ended up asking for an extra production credit and he got it -- they were just so stoked with the results, they didn't care. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2BYmmTI04I",

    "content": "2) The first was a practical reason to compress, the second is more creative. Compression allows us to shape the envelope of sounds, by varying the attack and release and type of compressor we use (we'll come back to that). Why would that be useful? A few examples;\n\n- A fast attack allows us to tame the front of a sound, and set it back in an arrangement. Our ears are naturally drawn to shorter sharper transients, and that can be a lovely thing. But say for example I've got a bright and transient heavy acoustic guitar, it might be distracting me from the vocal and the story of the song, a fast attack and low ratio could allow me to \"set it back\" behind the vocal, without turning it down or darkening it too much\n\n- Another way we can use the envelope shaping is to bring out the body or thump in a sound. Take something like a bright snare crack, a compressor like a DBX160 will grab the front transient and soften it, and then the release curve will give the body and shell of the snare this chunky weight that can be really musical",

Soft has what I understand to be a \"smart\" floating threshold that kind of rides the signal, versus hard is closer to a fixed threshold (and I believe depth then affects the ratio and threshold in it's own way). So, if you were trying to zone in on a frequency that only occasionally rears it's head, hard mode with a lower depth will be generally more accurate and not affect the other parts of the audio nearly as much. I don't like using Soothe on sibilance, but I actually found it quite effective after learning this by setting it to hard mode with a very broad \"sharpness\".",

He duplicated the lead vocal twice to have three tracks and had this plugin as the first insert on each track, split into three bands for each channel, low vocal, mid vocal, high end vocal. The plugin auto syncs the band settings in all instances whenever you adjust a band. He was saying Serban uses this plugin and does that exact thing on some songs. After treating each track with some eq/comp/saturation the vocal sounded really big but balanced. And it\u2019s like $60 so I think I\u2019m going to have to grab it.

It\u2019s no biggie just for a H-Delay and a vintageverb/metaflanger/ whatever.\n\nLike they mentioned on the podcast, this method encourages more experimentation for me, and also circumvents niggly things like trying to get a word to echo on the downbeat if it was sung on an offbeat - you just move the clip forward or backward in time. And if an Ess is too apparent, you can clip gain it down in the source etc.\n\nPlus once you have your verb throw set, when you in turn commit that throw, whatever it is about seeing the audio just suggests further details like having it cut abruptly on a beat, or reverse it, or fade it in, or EQ it etc.",

It separates between tonal and noisy parts of the signal and gives you volume slider.  This will only help you if there's some breathiness to bring up that isn't buried at the level of the noise floor.\n\nIf you don't want to do a whisper track + vocalign you can also play around with a Vocoder with the carrier being noise or a sample of breath and blend that in parallel.\n\nI think new whisper track plus vocalign will get you there the fastest and most convincing.",

For me, I\u2019ve seen over the years that I get faster at recognizing when it\u2019s feeling right and when it\u2019s feeling wrong. And if I\u2019m unsure which is often I try not to obsess over and leave it for a bit and keep mixing.

    "content": "theres so many ways to interpret this question. so here's my take. Mixing to me at least, is all about bringing out the intent of the record to the best of your abilities. Fx. if you are mixing a Classical record, all you aim for is probably getting something as close to being in the room as possible, and therefore fidelity. If you are mixing some new urban underground cultural music, you want to respect the grittiness as that can sometimes be part of the sound and/or culture, and you never want to remove the inherent DNA of what makes that thing exciting(even tho it might be unconventional). So in the end, it's OUR job to make the decisions on when to be rough and when to be high fidelity. It's all about what you want out of the music. For most mainstream music(aka. radio oriented) i would personally get a bit of both. Get the mix sounding somewhat exciting as to pull in the listener, but also have certain aspects be high fidelity as to make it easy to listen to. FX, in a pop record, Vocal intelligibility is super important if you want people to sing along, where are in a techno track or hyperpop track you can have some grittier vocals, as they aren't as intended to be the in the car sing along song. They would be much more about the energy and feeling. \n\nIMO theres nothing more boring than a perfect mix, where every sound is perfectly inline and has no personality that makes it memorable. \n\nThe creativity of a mix is just as, if not more important, than the technicals. Thats what those cyborgs called Mastering Engineers are for.",

My rule of thumb is lower voicing tend to occupy center-mid, and the higher voicings out wide to create a wider spread. Like if I was making a Queen record, I'd probably stick to your approach because the arrangement would be airtight -- and LCR would work great. But if I was fucking with some indie pop producer that has a boner for a million tracks in his session, then it's warfare and I'm just trying to place things where they work.",

(take for example something like a screeching ambient guitar solo or vocal riff sitting in the background during ~big chorus 3~). Lately i've been challenging myself to actually push UP the frequencies that really make up the certain track's identity, then focusing on it's volume in the mix instead. so far this has felt like things in an arrangement each have a more tangible attitude, instead of where I was at in the past where everything was silky smooth and balanced, thus becoming a soft-midrange-soup. The instinct is as simple as something like make believes MBSI strip, with the midrange EQ knob that can boost or cut, where I would usually use it to cut a dense part of that element, i'll now *boost* it and just turn the track down.

If you have a Piano and a Guitar playing full chords in the same octave, you'll never get good sounding separation, no matter how much you try and manipulate the sound.\nSounds are made from a fundamental and certain overtones/harmonics. If they overlap, then they overlap, even if you add a random eq boost on each sound some Freqs apart, because someone on youtube did that. (not that you can't do it, and it wont work)\nBut Instead of removing good sounding parts of a sound forcing them to fit together(whatever that even means at this point), arrange the parts so they naturally fit together with separation. This way you'll be able to act more, creatively and instinctively on how you want the sounds to sound while mixing, instead of fitting a triangle into a circle. As the good old saying says, it starts at the source, for the best results. \n\nFx, in a typical jazz band, often a Bass will play roots on 1 & 3,  a piano will of then play the root and 5th an octave above that, and a guitar could play the 3rd and 7th, and together all the instruments make big full chords while also having their own space. this way there is now plenty of room for a singer or a Sax player to do its thing and not worry to much about cutting through a dense mix.",

I wrote it for myself when I was working under Mark Ralph after I cost myself a bunch of time once by doing prep steps in the wrong order, so from then on I'd pull up my own guidelines every time to make sure I did everything right. One of my early ballsings was not checking the ref against the delivered parts in enough detail, and we had an instance where the wrong vocal take for part of a verse wound up getting mixed (producer fucked up by sending the wrong one, but I fucked up by not catching it), and it wasn't caught til we sent Mix 1 back to the client. No biggie, and Mark was insanely patient with that kind of thing, but I felt it as a massive fuck up as the last pair of hands before things went down to the A rig. \n\nSo I added the line to my notes in block fucking caps **MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE REFERENCE FUCKING PROPERLY - VOCALS VOCALS VOCALS!!!!**\n\nOne day Jack from Clean Bandit was upstairs in the kitchen where the B rig was, saw the note on my laptop screen and thought it was an email from Mark \ud83d\ude02 Jack is so genuinely kind, he asked about it as if I might be trapped in an abusive relationship and he could get me out.

Could have and should have taken up a member here on a generous mic lending offer (you know who you are \ud83d\ude4f ), but decided I could roll with my own gear.

A drive across town would have gotten me the right tools for the job and made everything smooth and easy.

Had to step away for a few days, and then spent most of yesterday trying every trick in my book to get the phase of the vocal and gtr mic to be happy (it sounded fine so long as the artist wasn't singing loud\u2014then it became phase city in a few loud passages as the gtr mic got more and more vocal). Time adjuster, playing with Little Labs IBP, EQ, whatever. Still mostly a huge bummer. But!

HPF a bandaid for something that was incorrectly recorded with too much low end. A Pultec high boost a bandaid for something too dark. Sometimes you get a vocal that has a pokey resonance that happens at 3k and if you try cutting with EQ, it kills the aggressiveness\u2026 but if you do it dynamically, it only snags it when the frequency poked 15 dB above where it should.",

I just had a quick peek at the session and this might have been the last project with my hardware mix bus (UTA MPEQ -> OG UnFairchild V1). Everything came from Ryan very well cooked with his analog futzery and UAD stuff, so lots of coralling with EQ on my end... not much added compression. Looks like the guitar solo went through my old Federal 864 compressor -- which is wild, that thing works on something every 6 months maybe. Some drums went through my old SansAmp pedal. Lots of the guitars got squeezed with my Scully 280s. The whole album has the vocals going through my BG2 -- although this one has some snippets that were ITB... Ryan was constantly tweaking the production throughout the mix process, hence the many versions. A fun collaborative process with a record I still get excited to listen to.",

A dynamic can be cool to minimize room engagement, which can be great if the singer is loud and the room isn\u2019t great. David Bock\u2019s paper on capsules is really enlightening. I would definitely try and avoid a chinese capsule a la Rode mics, but the mic amp is also very important. I\u2019d avoid condensers that have intense artifacts at high SPL because of their mic amp circuits(Brauner Phantom and the Neumann TLM series come to mind). It can be quite hard to find a condenser that has that vintage-U47 style body under a certain level of investment, which is why I might reach for a large-diaphragm dynamic or a ribbon(and boost highs). I\u2019d what that low-mid body to balance out the density in the high mids. But I\u2019m mostly talking about belly tenors here, with Betty female singer I would probably be fine with something with less body(like a U67-style mic) It\u2019s quite an in-depth topic I find, you can hit me in the dms if you have specific questions.",

    "content": "So for this song I was hired to produce and mix it. I got the stems from the demo and did the production in ableton. Then vocals were recut in London and I was sent a Pro Tools session. I always cut and edit in Pro Tools, so I used this session to comp and arrange the new vocals, but then I wanted to just bring it back into ableton and blend with the existing production. So I bounced the vocal from Pro Tools dry  (no verb or delay) but with tuning and some compression and EQ. Then I used some of the demo vocal and some of the new vocal in the final mix.\n\nI'm pretty comfortable committing eq and compression on my vocals (the confidence of years of doing this... ps you should do it more, it's good for the workflow). But if I needed to go back for some reason I could go back to the Pro Tools session. I think I did go back once to remove tuning on an ad lib that was part singing, part talking. \n\nI'm getting much more comfortable mixing in ableton. The only thing that really sucks about it is that the sessions do tend to slow down when there's TONS of vocals with autotune inserts (the equivalent number of tracks and autotune instances in pro tools does not tax Pro Tools nearly in the same way). So thus far the only way that ableton really works for me to both produce and mix in is if I don't have raw vocals in there. Hence, bouncing from pro tools works best anyway.",

    "content": "Surprise surprise ima jump in with some Brauer bullshit again- zooming out of the vocal for a second, cuz I think the choices you\u2019re talking about making, when made in a vacuum, can lead you to very different places depending on what you\u2019re already hearing when you start adding vox fx. \n\nThe idea is to identify the 2 or 3 things that the brain can actually focus on at any given moment in a song as the leading roles. Song I was on the other day had horns, vocal, and occasionally gtr were leading and everything else was just supporting (either octaves of the same part, rhythmically the same, or pads on keys). So I got those 3 rocking together without worrying about every track, it was easy to identify the kind of space I needed. I wanted it in the same room as the brass, but really forward on the stage. If I\u2019d had the pads up while trying to do this I was always either too wet or too dry and couldn\u2019t find the happy place. The tl;dr is, if you\u2019re struggling to find a satisfying construction of ideas, you may be trying to treat leading and supporting parts as equally important, and you\u2019re challenging your ear to grab what\u2019s really important at that moment. \n\nAlso in Brauer\u2019s template there are a folder of verbs that everything in the session shares including vocals. So you get a sense of cohesion from that, and the vocals have their own folder of delays that are unique to them. That helps create separation.",

This lets you place the instrument in the stereo field of the reverb. Doing it with mondo mod allows you to keep it static but also automate movement (small or large) within the verb \ud83d\ude42\n\nAnother idea:\nUse Waves StudioVerse (or similar plugin that allows this routing)\n-parallel split the dry/wet \n-wet gets what ever verb you want\n-Leave the wet panned out-wide\n-pan the dry in towards the middle \n\nDoing it with StudioVerse allows you to avoid making aux-sends and keep it all on the track level. (Very useful on bgvs)\n\nLast idea:\nUse a pan control plugin (S1, TrackControl, etc) after the verb so you can make it more mono if you want. \n\nI love verb/dly haha thanks for letting me talk  about it here\u2026my wife is tired of hearing about it \ud83e\udd72",

    "content": "Honestly, this is where the difference is between good and great gear. I find if you get the right mic/pre combination, the esss problem is a lot more manageable. I\u2019ve used the pencil technique before and was surprised how effective it was at taming esses and plosives, but it was a scenario where I couldn\u2019t reach for another mic. Also angling the capsule slightly can help, but you have to be careful not to get the singer outside the pickup pattern. Much like micing an acoustic, you can do some real Eqing just by angling up more towards the nose or down towards the chest. I tend to like a vocal mic a bit lower than most people seem to put it. \n\nAlso, @NoahNeedleman  can attest, if I\u2019m in the session I\u2019m proactively fighting against S lyrics, especially if you\u2019ve decided that that\u2019s the sound you want to aliterate in a verse. Straight to songwriting jail. \n\nAlso, like Noah said re: eq ing esses, you can usually see on pro q3 the shitty part of the ess and eq it out\u2026 because it also tends to be a combination of the singers resonance and the mic resonance, it\u2019s almost always the same across all of the esses in any particular track.

I usually just put a time delay on it before reverb if I want musically timed reverb, but I personally tend not to go towards that direction very often. I\u2019m also a big throws person so mostly my main reverb that are sent to aux tracks have medium to longer predelay and throws would have shorter predelay. Sometimes it\u2019s the other way around too. I also like to make decisions based on how long I want the vocals to be closeup for before I hear the reverb kick in. Or I also print reverb sometimes and nudge it around in different parts and play with fades if I wanna get really sculpt-y with it. I do this with reverb throws (dups clips to audio tracks rather than sends) more often than send verbs.",

I guess what I meant to say is that through the dozens of interviews with Jon and Matt, it's clear that he's averse to using compressors and tends to use saturators more to do the job. While I fuckin' LOVE me some saturators, I honestly don't see the two as interchangeable... they're just two very different tools. One is leveling volume and the other is distorting a waveform to generate harmonics. I think saturators are a great next level tool for people who have wrapped their brains around compression.... but you really need some form of compression on an un-treated vocal. I feel in contemporary music, people are leaning too much on high-end saturation to get things to sound exciting and hyped. If I'm ever using saturators to distort things (which is often), I'm always trying to find some sort of un-distorted high end source to help the ears cling to clarity in the mix. Sometimes, things will distort in a way that will add this clarity -- or even manufacture it. But most of these multi-band saturators are just adding a layer of fuzz to the entire midrange up and the whole mix just ends up sounding hazy. IMO, a great example of modern hip-hop mixing is Mac Miller's Circles. The high end on that record sounds just as exciting as anything else, but it doesn't sound like everything got ran through a buzz saw (shoutout Greg Koller/Jon Brion). Just my 0.02.",

But applying noise reduction across the entire frequency spectrum can reduce clarity, which I really want to maintain in the lead. SO. If you grab the brush tool in RX you can hone in on the most audible parts of the noise and create \"fade-ins+outs\" of noise reduction, maintaining top end clarity in your vocal but masking noise at starts, stops, and ends of phrases. Can be a real life-saver, Cheers!",

I won a golden ticket in this biz (straight white cis man from a globally loved culture + supportive family + easy access to major music capital + multiple lucky breaks etc, obviously coupled with hard work but everyone here works hard), but before that ticket cashed, I was grinding as an audio educator to pay my rent too (albeit just teaching music software to largely to hobbyist producers).

    "content": "The Way to Export All Tracks from Logic to Equal the Exact Mix that the Artist/Producer Left Off From\u2122\n\n1. Any busses you want printed need to be showing as \"tracks\" in the Arrange window. You can do this from your Mix Window by selecting all busses/auxes you want to print, right-click, choose \"Create Track\", and now those Busses/Auxes will show up in your Arrange Window. Do this for any and all effects, parallel busses, etc etc\n\n2. ignore step 2\n\n3. Turn on your Cycle range you want to export (yellow bar across the top like Marv said) and select all tracks you want to export\n\n4. File --> Export --> All Tracks as Audio Files\n\n5. If next dialog box doesn't have options showing, smash that Options Button and choose various options\n  a. Range: Export Cycle Range Only\n  b. Uncheck \"Bypass Effects Plug-ins\" if you want their processing\n  b. Include Audio Tail and Include Volume/Pan Automation selected\n  c. Normalize Off\n\n6. I suggest making an AES-Standardly-named New Folder and exporting into that \n\n7. Export that bad boy\n\nThis will ensure you can import into your Industry Standard DAW exactly where they left off, minus the mix bus processing. \n\nIf they're sharing effects (e.g. guitar and vocal both going to a verb), and you want them both wet but also separate, then they'll need bounce those separately or dup the verb send/return (in which case their Valhalla Vintage Verb will be 12dB too loud b/c they'll forget to turn off their 2bus processing when they bounce it separately)",

When you learn to do it and to hear it, you learn why it's so important (pulling low end plosives out of a vocal so it doesn't pin the compressor, for example). From there you learn how and when to break it (I like boosting the 200hz-ish body of a live snare drum into a parallel compressor/ saturator to solidify and have control of that frequency range, automate it for fills, etc.).\n\nIMO this is a great \"rule,\" which is great to learn and then break all the time.",

    "content": "- The classic example of compression is to use a fast release with something like a parallel drum buss. As the release lets go and brings up the room gain you get this urgent and explosive energy. When the room is good, and the compression timing is set right it can really make things sound bigger than real life. Remember we're trying to tell a story here, we can't jam the *actual* real power and size of stadium rock drums into that mono speaker at Target but listen to Paradise City and it tells the story pretty well ... our brain does an amazing job of filling in the rest\n\n- The last example is using something like a good tube compressor on vocals. With a nice soft knee and lots of gain reduction we get bring up a bunch of low level and emotional detail, breathy whispery stuff at the end of lines etc that can really help a lyric connect. Often with something like a good tube compressor we get a healthy amount of harmonic distortion too along for the ride which adds weight to the vocal and draws the listeners attention",

    "content": "Not sure how helpful this is, but: as I\u2019ve mixed more and more, I think consciously about this less. I tend to try and find 2-3 instruments/vocals that will occupy the main focus of a given song or section, and just put those faders up and try and get them to sound amazing. Then everything else just gets gradually turned up and processed to fit in with or accentuate those primary parts. I\u2019ll often briefly solo them to high pass and usually subtly low pass, then sneak the fader up and not touch any solos again. Getting a track a little too quiet, and then hunting around with Spectre, an API style EQ, or Sie-Q for a pleasing frequency to accentuate works well for finding a spot in the frequency range. Also I will often aggressively scoop out low mids on sampled/software instruments as I find these almost always have way more weight there than needed in even a minimally dense mix. FX may be added at any point along the line: if I know it\u2019ll be integral to the part I\u2019ll pop \u2018em on a bit while soloing at first, if not I\u2019ll sneak the effect in gradually with everything else playing. I definitely need to be fairly aggressive with filtering as things get more dense, particularly in the low end.",

    "content": "From my experience, mic positioning is the key with getting the clean brightness in vocals. A lot of times I\u2019d put the mic slightly above or below the mouth to have the full spectrum of vocals without accentuation of high mids. The idea is that the voice projects through the mic not to the mic. This allows me to boost natural top end without having to make weird or any cuts on the high mids. Key thing is to keep the pop filter at the same height as the mouth so they don\u2019t start looking up or down to match the height of the mic. That can be detrimental to vocal performance as it strains their neck. \n\nSometimes people record too close to the mic. From my experience, it doesn\u2019t take the EQ too well unless you\u2019re intentionally going for the proximity effect to have a little more woomph. If you\u2019re going for that, dynamic mic may be a better choice. \n\nI would spend some time working with the artists to go over mic positions on zoom before recording. For the vocals that are already recorded, I can\u2019t really say much about what to do because there\u2019s no context, but I\u2019d say try not to over process because that would get things sounding dull very easily.",

I would start by going heavy handed on the most innocuous of the pile-up and see where that takes you. Saturation is a great way of doing this without making things pokey... but might be good to audition with an EQ first to see what zones you should focus in on. Once you have an idea of where you're going, then you can fire up Saturn 2 or Spectre or Neutron and go to work.",

But generally my approach might look something like this: First pull down the volume by a bunch. Then usually you\u2019ll want to add in some transients back again. I like Spiff for this to taste. Then sometimes Master Rebalance by Ozone can be a life saver. Especially if say the balance of some instruments are clashing with the vocal or the 808/bass is too loud in relation to everything else. Essentially I\u2019m \u201cunlimiting the beat\u201d. \n\nThen together with the vocal in the mix I\u2019ll try to shape the beat around the vocal with some subtle (usually reductive) eq moves. Something like dynamically sidechaining a bell on the hihat frequencies to the vocal can help a lot. Or I might also play with Spectral Shape. Some people get good results with sidechaining the vocal as a whole with trackspacer or soothe. Then if I\u2019m missing some super lows or excitement I might throw a Pultec/Bax-type EQ or Spectre on it. \n\nSo ultimately I\u2019m creating as much space as possible and give myself enough headroom to still do some typical mixbus moves.\n\nTo me this removes the need to do anything different on the mixbus. Even though it\u2019s likely I won\u2019t be able to push as hard.",

Maybe with plugins we have too many opportunities to tweak em to \u201cblend\u201d in the mix when the opposite might be better.\n\nHere are a few things I like to do with vocal FX:\n- Chorus / Doubler that I then distort and will boost some high mid frequency (spectre is great for that)\n- mono slap back is underrated, can be very appropriate in modern mixes\n- Mentioned many times but compressing / distorting / EQing reverb returns (side chaining the compressor in the return with the dry vocal as key can really make vocal reverb bloom)\n- Also, I don\u2019t always tempo sync my delays, sometimes 300ms just works \n-",

I think it can be easy to get in the weeds with the \u201cMix Buss\u201d  I\u2019ve found for myself that I will try these different techniques over the years for example,no mix buss treatment and only a limiter.  Then I tried the music/vocal buss thing. Then I tried only processing the groups and lighter on then mix buss processing.  What I learned is there is no right or wrong way to do anything  and it\u2019s good to try different approaches out but if you feel you are fighting something it\u2019s a good idea to check the processing and see if it\u2019s tying your hands. The only way I know how to do this is gain match your inserts and turn them on and off.   I\u2019ve mixed with the inflator and had good results,  and it\u2019s also been horrible. I\u2019ve mixed with Vulfcomp on the master (generally a horrible idea  but in certain cases it rules!) I even mixed with altiverb on the mix buss recently.  Good technique is  very important but sometimes I like mixing into something wildly colorful and it can take you to very interesting places sometimes you have to work harder for it but the end result can very unique",

    "content": "Couple of random thoughts:\n1. If the synth is extremely subby, consider pushing in some midrange via EQ or saturation to help definite it in the mix. Sometimes these synth basses are swimming in sub and the more you turn them up, the more it eats up headroom while still not really being able to hear it.\n2. Are you competing against other low end sources outside of the kick? If so, you\u2019ll have to divide and conquer the frequency ranges and let each one live in a specific zone. For example, if you have a bass guitar, make sure that its voiced in the fundamental 200-400hz area and leave the sub handle things below the kick.\n3. Utilizing the analyzer in Pro-Q3 can be helpful for finding conflicting frequencies. You can throw Pro-Q3 on say the synth bass and the kick track, then on the synth bass instance, pull up the kick as a secondary histogram in Pro-Q3 and you\u2019ll have a nice visual representation of where the kick is trying to punch through. You can then use some creative cutting to carve room for the kick. Or vice-versa.\n4. Sometimes when nothing is working with synth bass and I need to do something drastic, I\u2019ll delay one side of it 30mz to widen it out and get it out of the center. This can fall apart in certain mono-situations, but will often clear way for more bass instruments and the kick drum if done right.\n\nAs always, all of this is dependent on everything. YMMV.",

In this situation you can\u2019t get to the vocal because you don\u2019t have the track, BUT if you\u2019re mixing, you can reach for the vocal and boost a narrow Q at 1500hz to accomplish the same task but in a cleaner way.\n\nThis is the type of reason I might reach for M/S, I don\u2019t reach for M/S if guitars need to be brighter on the sides, I find the guitars on the sides in my mix, and make them brighter.\n\nThis is also the same reason to argue against multiple bus processing, because if the ability to use such a processor is there, we will use it, take away a bus and we have to work harder to get the mix done, but the end result can be much more effective, impactful, dynamic, and inspiring, but it takes longer and requires a lot more finesse.",

It may sound like too much when the verb return is loud but when you sink the verb down it usually is really effective for me.\n\nI like to use a mono aux with a delay plug-in for predelays, with a bus as the input and a bus to the verb as the output. No predelay on the verb itself, you make it before hand on this aux. Reason for this being you have a lot of control on your send signal that only the verb hears. A midrangey verb and a full range dry vocal make for depth and texture that can peacefully co exist. You can de ess the send harder than the real LV. With this pre delay aux you can make the send signal darker or brighter. If the song calls for it, make a second aux and have multiple predelays feeding the same verb. For example, a 16th with no feedback that is 80% wet, and a second input bus to same output bus that is dark 1/4 note 100% wet and with feedback where you can automate the send to that long feedback predelay and leave the short no feedback 1/16 static. You can get a lot of mileage out of the same verb with these multiple pre delays and provide some cohesive varied space.",

Then you can try to use EQ in a way that best preserves that relationship with the least harm done to the overall vocal sound.

For example, double tracking guitars, keep the same guitar cab and guitar but different amp head. Or different pickups from the same entire rig. Etc. \n\nThere have been a lot of good tips for layering vocals, to have the harmonies be different mics and preamps or simply stepping away from the mic to get more distance. \n\nAs far as plugins and stereoizing, even a simple pitch shift plugin can do a lot. Delay 15-30ms each side, pitch +/- 5-10 cents, can get a cool effect if used subtly",

    "content": "\u201cThis held true over into the recording world for me as well. When I was trying to capture something in my head I was a slave to it, but when I\u2019m trying to capture something in someone else\u2019s head, I\u2019m merely curious and experimental. And *that\u2019s* when I learned the craft. Mixing, recording, producing, etc. \u201c\nThis resonates with me so much right now. I\u2019ve found the biggest challenge most recently has been , being able to learn to mix (particularly vocals ) to someone else\u2019s taste/aesthetic that isn\u2019t my own. I came into mixing from mixing my own productions where it was always just making the sound I want. Currently here in London a lot of young rappers like this huge ambient reverb sound for their vocal  that to my ear just leaves a long washyness over the instrumental and I find very hard to accept as appropriate for the groove/tempo and on a rhythmic .delivery ... I think it sounds better dry ...learning how to successfully achieve an aesthetic I disagree with  , to someone else\u2019s satisfaction has been a really rewarding journey of self as well as skill. However , If I\u2019m mixing gabba records in 5 years I\u2019ll have taken this too far",

I may well be v late to this but have recently been getting into Logic\u2019s Selection-Based Processing function and have found it to be excellent for Vocal Clean-Ups. The selection based processing allows you to create a new take every time that appears in the timeline with the original unprocessed region as a takes folder just like when you loop record. What\u2019s handy I\u2019ve found is if you wanna quickly soothe, or de-ess / gullfoss your vocal but not apply it to the whole vocal take.....simply use selection based processing on the whole vocal and create a new take for each process (one soothed , one gullfossed , de Esser etc)....then go back into the timeline and simply comp the soothed/guullfossed take for the  problem areas...into the original take ...it takes seconds with the highlighter and then you can flatten the takes and its all done! So you\u2019ve Only got the processing exactly where you want it and nowhere else. I guess pro tools clip fx does the same ? But this is a lovely one for logic.....super quick and clean",

Boosting with SPECTRE is nice but any eq can help add weight to a vocal if you\u2019re boosting correctly. I would suggest having the dynamics tamed to your liking before boosting low end in a vocal because it can easily get out of hand\n\nYou could try duplicating the take, use RX de-reverb or whatever you can to remove as much ambience as possible, compress it heavily and blend it in. Obviously compression will bring out ambience so as to not let that become an issue try removing it beforehand. \n\nAVOX duo is a neat trick I use sometimes to help give a vocal some dimension.

    "content": "If you set up your Pro Tools template in a certain way, you can bounce stems super fast. I set up auxes and route stuff to them that will be a stem, so it\u2019s part of the prep process (i.e. route Lead Vocal to Lead Vocal Aux, Keys 1 to Keys 1 Aux and so forth), so choose what you will for the song and split up however much you need to. Then I use sends (or you can multi-output) to respective audio tracks and name them (you can also include Instrumental, TV Mix and A Cappella as their own audio tracks). Record-enable all the audio tracks, record them down. Then use Soundflow to copy the mix buss plugins you need (Copy Track Data macro), copy them to all the audio tracks, then use Track Bounce to offline bounce all of the stems in one go, and it will include the plugins. Takes about 10-15min.\n\nThe only caveat with this is that you have to route any effects to the same aux, like Lead Vocal Verb has to go to Lead Vocal Aux and nowhere else, so you can\u2019t share effects. But if you just create verbs for each thing as you go (or set up in your template) it\u2019s no problem.",

Zero shade on that writer, they just weren\u2019t engineer minded and would commit stuff, chop it up, swap verse 1 with verse 2, process it etc along the writing journey.

But I have, for whatever reason, recently been hit up more often about having me mix...and sometimes there isn't the budget to hire a proper mixer (I advocate for that up front whenever possible, even going so far as telling most people they should hire a mixer rather than me if they have to choose one).\n\nNormally I just do the stereo master in those situations after saying my piece about the value of a mixer, but when people don't want to hire a mixer I have been considering just asking for the session (was chatting this with @Joshua Riley actually the other day). \n\nOften when I hear the \"mix\", I know if I just had the session I could improve it by way more than just having the stereo file...say just raise this here a half db put some color only on the vocal, tweak the mixbus, but for a lot of reasons I haven't asked for that yet. Maybe I will try this and see about the results!\n\nCorollary is I find that stem \"mastering\" is honestly the worst of all the worlds, for me it would be either the standard stereo file master or give me the session. Which I would approach with a mastering mindset, accepting things for what they are and listening big picture.\n\nAlso I've come from producer/mixer land and being new to mastering in late 2022/2023 really...I am sorta less attached to what mastering \"is\" in the philosophical sense.\n\nI often think of mastering as just making the song better (to my taste and ear) within the almost arbitrary restriction of just having the stereo file. Of course this ignores the mindset of approaching a full project! Which is a huge part of mastering. \n\nBut as you stated, with how technology is evolving and the ease with which we can send stuff, may change. Excited to see where it goes!",

More and more people are accustomed to vocals feeling this way, and not just dynamic flattening with overcompression, but emotional flattening as well. People are referencing vocals that feel like this. And by the time things get to us, they're often sufficiently dehumanized to the point where trying to inject more \"natural\" dynamics etc is already a fools errand",

An example might be Goodhertz, which you may have installed once before as a trial or part of a bigger pack, but not authorized yet or the trial ran out. All DAWs will load the session with presumably no problems, but it's not until you manually open the insert itself that you realize the plugin has been operating in bypass the entire time. Waves even does a version of this now too, but it's active with 15-30sec intervals of silence. Multiply this with basically every plugin manufacturer and it becomes a very complex matrix. Furthermore, some plugins aren't as backwards compatible as they should be or different computer architectures impact settings carrying over. AutoTune (the bane of my existence) for a long time would flip settings if you went from a silicon Mac to an Intel Mac, but not vice-versa. Too many gremlins to account for to be fully reliant on their session as-is, but of course it happens. nature of the beast.",

So my spidey sense goes up, I make the ask and sure enough the vocal engineer who cut the feature got the file off a text thread which had converted it to m4a, that was used to track the vocal over, then sent back to me, etc. We were on really tight deadline but luckily we could make the switch and get it done.\n\nThis issue happens almost daily where people send files on iMessage, it can say it is a wav on their end but on receiving end it gets converted lossy.

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering  Thank you ruairi . I appreciate it . Starting with the vocal is actually a very pertinent point for me . \nFor this body of work I\u2019m going  through currently the vocals are all tracked to a 2track instrumental but  with most of the songs  I\u2019m importing all the instrumental multitracks  into a new alternative of the mix and ditching the stereo instrumental , much for the reason you\u2019ve pointed to there . \nThe balance of the instrumental sounds excellent to itself but once you start mixing the vocals , they really need a re balance of the instrumental mix elements to allow space . So this has had me listening to the vocal alone first at length and then bringing back the instrumental elements very much around it. I was thinking yesterday how remarkably different a balance was needed to give the vocal its place.  It feels like trying to matchmake two friends who are going to be great together if you can just find the right setup , \nMain weapons (of love ) have been faders , panning and gentle eq . All of which I learnt how to harness their true power here . I\u2019m back at it again this morning and feel great about the challenge again and do love these songs . The artists are telling true stories and speaking their truth in them and that\u2019s what drives me to excel with a project \n\n\nThere\u2019s also an addictive joy and fear dynamic here atm as I continue my ever deepening realisation that there is no perfect mix to find and attach myself to ! \n\nI have to remain open for the \u201cfeeling \u201c right ? Ha ha . This is Some mystical stuff we engage ourselves in I swear \n\nThanks Ruari , best wishes",

    "content": "I think that might be a limiting factor on top of the artists' abilities (Pop Smoke already sounded dope before his setup got professional https://youtu.be/317TP4JOSSE). I've recorded not-so-great rappers through nice chains and mixing wasn't the answer to save a (lacking) source. It never gave you *that* feeling. But even if you are recording great rappers cheaper mics tend to lack body and rarely have \"boostable\" or pleasant top end as you said. So it's a bit complicated before you even get to \"mixing\". Felt that was important to mention so you're not too hard on yourself.\n\nBut assuming that the limiting factor really is just mixing there's a bunch of options. First things first: is your monitoring and listening environment decent? Or are you on headphones? This could make placing vocals even harder for you. \n\nThen do you have a process that starts with vocal cleanup to get rid of or reduce unappealing harshness or performance issues? Despite being simple, people tend to skip basic tools like clip-gain to even out a performance. This should usually also give you some leeway for strategic boosts. Maybe instead of EQ look at harmonics. Fresh Air by Slate is free. Gem Dopamine is nice. Spectre is great. All of these should give you that \"sizzle\" you might be missing.\n\nThen to get the presence and even out the performance you could try some parallel compression with something like an 1176. Also, try out Multiband Compression with the Mcdsp 404 or C6 or whatever you have to control the performance throughout the song once you've got a vocal sound you like.\n\nI also find mixing the 808 & drums together with the vocal the most useful when it comes to gain staging and getting the song to feel right.\n\nObviously, there's more that could be said but I find processes more helpful than tools. It's art at the end of the day. Attached what Serban's assistant sees as their/his \"mixing process\". Mix more and experiment with what you have. Get feedback from the artists.",

    "content": "A huge majority of the work I do is tracked at home by indie artists and I'm often wearing a lot of hats with a \"mix\" that can vary from a track that hits my inbox completely edited (timed, tuned, audio cleaned) and I can sit down and mix a track in one sitting (2-3 hours) before I feel good about sending it off.  That situation for me almost always involves programmed drums or drums printed by the artist with a committed sound.  However, that being the ideal I can also be completely transforming and recovering tracks that arrive with tons of noise, resonances, artifacts, clicks, multitracked drums not phase or time aligned, sloppy super dynamic playing etc, vocal timing and tuning.  On that side it can take days and days, weeks and weeks, or even months off an on depending on the artist and track count.\n\nMy advice on projects like that #1 is make sure you are negotiating your rate based on the extra work expected of you and #2 try and compartmentalize so that you are doing all the dull tedious work separate from the creative mixing.  Take a lot of breaks, and make sure you are communicating with the artist to manage expectations on why things are taking more time.",

So whatever\u2019s a part of the busses /subgroups adding up to the stereo mix should be left on. \n\nThe reason why: Most of the time they\u2019ll use the stereo mix in my experience, but if something like a shaker or lead synth is wailing away under a dialog moment, or something like a boomer is messing up a sound effect, they\u2019ll bust into the stems to mute those conflicting elements, but they\u2019ll want the song/mix to generally sound the same. \n\nSo for sync stems, they may have deliverable specs already, so doesn\u2019t hurt to ask, but if not, I always try to put myself in the mind of an editor and approach stem splits with the idea of \u201cif it could be distracting, it gets its own stem.\u201d Generally, aside from basic inst groups, I\u2019ll split out high perc stuff, boomer/swooshers/lifters, any leads/solos, and of course vocals always get split lead and BGVs as separate stems.",

Maybe multiple midrange elements will be competing, but the ear can only focus on one at a time (in addition to the drums, bass, and maybe vocal) so YOU choose and shift the focus!\n\nMy second approach is to take two or more of the competing tracks, say kick and bass, and play them together. No point in soloing one. EQ one while listening through it to the other. You may notice that you can subtract quite a bit from the bass without losing its character, but the kick\u2019s punch is improved by the space you\u2019re carving out. I do this a lot with vocals, too\u2014focusing on the vocal inside a dense mix while subtracting from all the other stuff that\u2019s stepping on it. When the lead just finds its home in its own uncongested space, you know you\u2019ve got all the surrounding noise right.",

Also! I have found that one thing that totally affects the number of delay is the settings of my interface, there are a bunch of settings within the Apollo\u2019s (dsp load lock, UAD engine delay comp\u2026) that will affect the latency.

But I couldn\u2019t follow a timer consistently so I try to take breaks whenever I finish a section of work.\n\nSo for instance I\u2019ll get the session setup, organized, listen and take a look at some things that are really poking out at me. Then I\u2019ll make a conscious effort to get up and make a coffee or tea. (Short break 10 min tops)\n\nThen I\u2019ll come back and do some editing if needed and start getting the important things to feel/sound right (usually low-end & vocals). Then once I feel like I\u2019ve got then in a good spot I also step away again. This is the hardest break to take for me because it\u2019s just before I could go off into the deep end. But I\u2019ve usually spent an hour listening and tend to lose perspective if I were to go much further. Sometimes I\u2019ll also close the session and work on another project if I\u2019m not in a rush.\n\nBut approaching it from a more conscious perspective and removing myself once I\u2019ve hit certain check points is the only thing that\u2019s working for me.",

I setup a project with the name and everything, setup the invoice and can choice whether I want a deposit or not, then create a playlist and add the mixes to that, Artist can add notes etc, you can go through multiple versions and then once it\u2019s done, you add the files to the deliverables folder, they can click approve which will take them to a payment gateway to settle the invoice and straight after that, they download the deliverables package\nThere\u2019s a few deeper tools as well such as password locking, who has access to what, if you\u2019re just sharing a link you can choose which link has the ability to comment and approve, you can bring on project members as well so that they can manage the project and files and a few automation integrations as well as email notifications for everything. Also has google drive and Dropbox Integration",

Celemony\u2019s site has some walk through videos but YMMV with those. \n\nMy adhd brain enjoys the game like process melodyne brings to the  \u201chow can I get this vocal to sound the way I want\u201d most effectively & efficiently, which is part of why I just enjoyed diving in without too much concern. The art of knowing when to split a note, snap it, leave it, etc is something that\u2019s just gonna take time.\n\nI\u2019d say that the formant tool was something I neglected for a while but it\u2019s been a feature I\u2019ve found subtle but defined utility for. You can help out a vocal with some formant shaping on some nasally or sharp vowels.\n\nOh and the \u201cmake loud notes quieter\u201d macro is a nice lil way to augment and enhance your clip gain process.",

I don\u2019t dislike this but have been listening to all sorts of records over the holidays with vocals set back a bit more and have been really enjoying it.  I really like PJ Harvey\u2019s \u201cWritten on the forehead\u201d as an example. It\u2019s a vibey mix by Flood which wouldn\u2019t really work being more upfront. I\u2019m wondering your thoughts on this? The obvious candidates are less level, more effects but there\u2019s a real art to that to still get the voice to cut through.  Rather than talk just of effects it would be interesting to see your philosophical takes on this. For me the louder vocal doesn\u2019t always mean a deeper connection to the song, in fact it pushes against the song when not done well and you have two parallel plains of sound hitting you.

And then it's kind of the same mindset for all of it, just a question of size/scope of my input, and I've found that to be a helpful way to tackle it.",

However , I listened recently to a bob horn talk where he described his vocal approach is to do his vocal clean up work , in order to get out clicks , pops , harshness etc and to get out any over heavy lows or low mids  before they go to his first compressor \u2026..but before the compressor first thing on the inserts is gullfoss in tame , no more than 10% and in this position it\u2019s virtually imperceptible and yet does defo do a nice little thing . I tried it and have found it v subtle",

We\u2019re still on this learning journey so happy for any pushback or insight\n\nFor the most part, our group felt the tradeoffs of very subtle multiband often outweigh the benefits, since just putting those crossovers in the signal makes a bigger difference than, say, a dB of control.\n\nWe felt more liberal use of multiband can add an aggression and excitement that is very familiar and unique, and prefer treating it as a sweetener or energizer over the whole mix more than trying to control problem areas that could be addressed on tracks.\n\nIn the signal chain, its position can drastically effect how other tools behave. Up front, it can help a bus compressor or saturation device behave more predictably, but may mush things too much. Near the end, it allows those devices to play a more colorful role but may cause weird behavior when using fast, \u201ctransparent\u201d limiters afterward. I like it first right now, most of our group like it near the end.\n\nThe hallmark signs of overuse for us were mixes that sound overly strident or when a vocal becomes inconsistent tonally from section to section as density changes.\n\nTools-wise, the group unanimously preferred minimum phase tools over linear phase or dynamic phase. OTT is a starting point, ear training to recognize that color. Once you hear it at 15-20%, you won\u2019t be able to unhear it on many pop records. After ingraining that color, ML4000 and C4 both have their own flavors that can do a thing while offering tweakability when needed.",

    "content": "So, I\u2019m a long-time follower of this thread, but have been to scared to post any questions as I\u2019m afraid to look like a total dumb ass\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a singer/songwriter/guitarist who has been teaching myself how to record/mix over the past few years. I don\u2019t totally suck, but I have a long way to go.\n\nI\u2019m working on a mix for a client\u2014yes that\u2019s new for me\u2014and I want to kill myself \ud83d\ude42\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a big, dumb rock song (I.e. Foo Fighters), and I can\u2019t for the life of me reign in the drums\u2014in other words, there\u2019s freaking cymbal bleed in EVERY mic. So, I have this situation where I tame the shitty cymbals\u2014then get something that sounds like kick and snare samples playing along to a vacuum cleaner. Mostly because I\u2019ve put every stinking plug-in like Soothe, multi-band compression and dynamic EQ on the overheads and rooms. Yeah! My cymbals don\u2019t poke your ears out\u2014but, they also sound like a Rumba.\n\nAnd gating did not work as the drummer is hitting his shitty cymbals on every freaking beat! I ended up sampling a god forgive\u2014clean snare hit and using that as a sample. It\u2019s okay, but without being able to raise the level of the rooms and overheads, I\u2019m kind of fucked.\n\nI found myself referencing this Joel Hamilton production/mix of a Highly Suspect song as it\u2019s kind of similar to what I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s on Puremix. He\u2019s pretty amazing. And while the music isn\u2019t my thing\u2014it sounds awesome. His mix sounds big and organic\u2014while mine sounds like an electric ham sandwich.\n\nWithout hearing the song, I don\u2019t know how much advice I can expect. I just mostly want to vent\u2026\n\nI sometimes wonder if I\u2019m the one that sucks, or is it the source material? When do you know you\u2019ve done the best you can with what you\u2019ve been given? You can\u2019t polish a turd. \n\nAnd as a newbie dipshit, I\u2019m trying so hard to make whatever I do be super awesome, badass\u2014whatever that means. But, maybe I just need to make the rough mix sound 20% better. I don\u2019t know.\n\nWow! That was long. Thanks for any advice\u2026",

Also, I usually do the Melo thing until the performance is completely satisfactory and then commit the track before moving any further with the mix. This is because when you Melo as an insert, it lifts the audio from the source audio track and then what you see in the edit window no longer represents what's playing.",

    "content": "@sinaigimenez You can go very scientific with this, but first thing I would do is find a handful of your favourite tracks and play them back at a level where you feel comfortable in your room - not too loud that it hurts, but feels relatively balanced.  Then use a quick SPL Meter in C weighted mode (loads available for iphone) and see where the SPL lands when playing back these tracks.  In my room it's around 75-80 db and I'm comfortable there.  I know that when I leave my monitor controller at my predetermined setting playing back mastered -9>Lufs tracks roughly how it should sound.  if something sounds dark/bright it's usually because it is.  Like wise if a vocal is too quiet, I'm not reaching for the main volume pot to turn the overall mix up, I'm turning the vocal up until it feels right.  And also, if my mix isn\u2019t feeling loud enough or present enough at the preset monitoring level I know I need to work harder to get it to sit in the same world as the refs.  Once you get your head around it, it\u2019s very freeing.  I use Metric Halo Monitor controller directly connected to my speakers and control via a Stremdeck (thanks @Bryan DiMaio !) and this has 5db volume steps where I know I can mix without my limiter at +10 and when the limiter is engaged I need to be back at 0. I imagine the Hilo has something similar?",

In my case I almost always use dry  lead vocals to start.  If people are very particular. I tend to bounce blends, such as a BGV stack or string or horn stack. In particular if there is arrangement automation. I\u2019m not trying to re do what they already like. But if it\u2019s not working for me I\u2019ll re do it. I have a template that has my busses routed and then I get organize and color code. Small sessions take about 15 mins to  prep and bigger sessions about 30 mins max.  If I can I prefer to prep before I plan to mix incase there are any issues with files ect. Sometimes I have an assistant doing it for me. Then I go to town",

There are people who use it that way and still get GREAT results.\nAs much as I want to simplify my workflow, 90% of the job is audio janitorial, I go back to simple eq, compression, fader...\n\nI saw another comment asking about Spiff > I don't know if anybody wanted my input on that but nevertheless - I like it sometimes on drums after tape-sims where it kills too much of the transients if I need to drive it more for *reasons* but the sound is lovely (i.e country), bit of spiff after and get best of borth worlds.",

    "content": "In my experience, double tracking the exact same instrument - like the same guitar - will usually just end up sounding phasey, not thick and wide. You really really want it to be 2 different guitars, using a different amp or EQ just doesn\u2019t really cut it, I find. And preferably also different amps and maybe even mics on the speakers. The more you\u2019re actually close to something that could literally be an acoustic event(meaning it could play out that way if you were recording both parts live simultaneously), the less phasey it will be. If vocal doubles are too close to the lead sonically, for example, they can end up sounding like a phasey reverb instead of adding punch. So definitely use a different mic. Like, even Freddie Mercury\u2018s background vocals can sometimes sound a bit one-dimensional because of this, though of course Queen\u2018s performances were utterly amazing(it usually was just one u67 they tracked with)",

Also if it is double tracks like others have said I like to sit them in diff places tonally or treat them differently (diff verbs or pushing diff eq points) it\u2019s the differences in the hard panned sources that create width. When tonally different information reaches each ear at the same time your brain tells you it\u2019s wide! When it\u2019s only subtlety different like in the case of doubles it can end up sounding mono again. A lot of the time I like to pick two elements that are holding it down throughout the track (maybe guitar and Rhodes) and then hard pan those in opposite directions. This maintains the balance left to right.  So I guess try hard panning a mono element and then balancing it out with a totally different mono element the other side.",

    "content": "Convolution is a strange technique to describe in a way that is intuitive to understand. But here goes:\n\nIn convolution you have two audio signals, your *input signal* and your *impulse response*. The simplest description of what convolution does is that it multiplies the *input* signal by the *impulse* signal and what it spits out is a new audio signal that includes only the frequencies and amplitude values that both signals have in common.\n\nPractically speaking, what this means is that when you convolve an *input* (let's say, a full frequency drum kit recording) with your *impulse* (let's say a 5 ms burst of white noise that was hi-passed at 500 Hz). What you end up with is a drum recording that sounds like it was hi-passed at 500 Hz.\n\nThink of it like how a vocoder works (which isn't that different). Your vocoder might combine a full-frequency synthesizer patch (input) with the frequency contours and time content of your voice (impulse/carrier). But if your voice doesn't have 100 Hz in it then we never hear the 100 Hz from the synth patch because the input and carrier/\"impulse\" don't share that frequency. What you hear is what both signals have in common. If your voice has a huge peak at 1.5k, then the synth patch is going to be accentuated in that same way.\n\nSo. What I'm saying is that if I have a complex EQ curve (ala Sonarworks corrective EQ) that I use as my *impulse response* and convolve it with, say, the output of my stereo buss, will it impart that frequency curve onto my mix *without* the phase shift that you'd get from a traditional FIR or IIR filter (aka traditional EQs)?\n\nIn short, I don't know because it's hard to search for the answer online. But I'm throwing a hail mary in case we've got any DSP nerds in the forum.",

But fidelity cannot IMO be appreciated in these specific places. \n\nOfc there are exceptions. But try eating at a restaurant on a beach promenade in south Spain and the restaurant next to you has a speaker 20 inches from your head blasting a different song. And tell me you think the vocal is warm or the drums are punchy. I think, sadly for general non music fans what they find in music, is less quiteness it\u2019s not even about the song. \n\nWhereas I think the people who enjoy music, will appreciate that extra punchy drum sound or warm vocal and deep bass. And I believe those people use headphones 80% of the time. They might have a great speaker system at home. But how much time do we really have at home listening to said speakers? Headphones are with us on the go all the time. Everyone I know under 30. Listens primarily on headphones. Or their iPhone speaker. Sometimes a JBL at the beach or park, and every now and then a party speaker at a party while drunk. The ones who really really love music, either have an old vintage speaker set from their parents or a Sonnos/smart speaker type thing. \n\nI still believe mixing for speakers is important, and @Nomograph Mastering has a great point in speakers translating to headphones easier than vice versa. But I always make sure shit sounds amazing on my AirPods. I\u2019d rather sacrifice something in the speaker than the AirPods. But then again. I don\u2019t have the accolades you do. So I might be shooting myself in the foot. But that is my general philosophy.",

Like obviously all the channel strip stuff and like X-series have been around with varying versions for the longest time. They definitely need more things that are a fresh take on something, like the Fusion stuff feels like their fresh take on buss processing. I'mma tryout the vocal strip you mentioned tho!",

Sorry for the novel.\n\nI totally agree with you that the mixer should be able to recreate/beat the rough by rebuilding chains in a better way and not sticking to exactly what you did. . I do that routinely too especially on lead vocals, mix buss, and other important elements, drums etc. Whatever I hear could be rebuilt better, I will if I have the option/access to the unprocessed files and it needs it.\n\nI guess I was more referring to when people take stuff off that is part of the vibe of the sound then say \u201cdo your thing, you can be creative!\u201d and then when it isn\u2019t identical to what they had, end up wanting me to use their thing because they heard it that way for 6 months.. ie really complex effect chains, a sound with 5 plugins stacked on it that, when removed totally changes the character of the sound, like @kylem  was saying which happens a lot with younger producers.\n\nWhen you send serban sessions, even if he zero's out the EQs and redoes the dynamics, I think starting off where the producer ended still has an advantage for everyone to see how the sausage was made, then he can decide to re create the elements he wants to using a better recipe. John Hanes even wrote a post on GS about how they want the actual sessions that match the production, and if they dont get them, he will go bar by bar on an important project to match it by ear to the rough before doing the actual mix...",

One thing I couldn\u2019t do though is de- bleeding everything else on the vocal mic track. It would fall apart and start having weird phase issues for some reason",

I listen to the vocal without fx, but with comp/eq somewhere around what it might be in the mix. Make a new playlist then edit clicks/pops with the RX-tools and plosives with \u201cA\u201d setting on pro-q. The \u201cB\u201d setting I described will be used to clean up breaths that have annoying frequency build up or \u201cs\u201d sounds that maybe not be recorded the best\u2026I\u2019ll change those settings to make it fit what ever I need to. This does not take long to do and sometimes I will use mouth-de click on the whole audio file with a gentle setting to start.",

It\u2019s a little wider than a mono mic so it works well as a single instrument with a vocal, but it\u2019s not gonna do a \u201cstereo\u201d thing. \n\nMy best advice out the gate is keep it about 6-8\u201d off the 10th feet and move around until the balance feels right. If you\u2019re missing brilliance, try raising the guitar or leaning left or right a little\u2026 it\u2019s really about your instrument and your room and which mics you\u2019ve got. \n\nHonestly x/y should be an easy way of getting the full guitar captured.",

I'm mostly intrigued by the prospect of trying some of these RX techniques when the vocal really has to carry the entire story, the usual interventions just aren't cutting it, continuity is still compromised, etc. Moments when you have an incredible performance on your hands from an amazing artist and storyteller who sadly isn't as great a vocal engineer.

Most of the time since I'm working in Ableton I'll use the pitch shifting modes there (Beat warp on drums for example, tones or complex on individual harmonic instruments).\n\nPlay around with different shifting algorithms to get the results you want.  Be warned though that Soundshifter definitely has its own character/tone so if the producer/artist are really used to that sound they may wonder what happened if it goes away.

My OG mix had this really aggressive edge to it that I kinda liked but it also felt way too scooped in the low mids. I checked out my old session and turns out I had cranked a ton of 8khz on the mixbus (a move I haven't felt compelled to do since 2021). Related I've been really enjoying thick / dense / full bodied mixes that still have excitement / edge up top especially for vocals and I had previously struggled to achieve a similar 'heft' in my own mixes compared to what I was hearing. I think in the past I was too quick to zap low mid resonances in my vocals / guitars. So I've been experimenting cutting less down around 200hz-600hz and emphasizing more. But then I felt I was losing some of that edge / excitement by see-sawing too much with the low mids relative to up top. I've found cutting some 170hz clears much of that up for me (like oh hey there's my snare or more room for kick / bass), I achieve the thickness above in that 200-600hz range and balance that with the excitement around ~8khz.

I\u2019m gonna play fast and loose with technical accuracy here in an effort to make this understandable and actionable for a real record maker\n\nAt its simplest an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is a mathematical process that splits a signal into a bunch of slices/bands/bins (technically it\u2019s component sine waves) which can be then acted upon or processed separately. This is *not* the same as a crossover or even a linear phase crossover, for various complicated reasons. The iFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) simply reverses this process and reconstitutes a single signal out of the many bands/slices/bins\n\nOk, off to a good start. It should be fairly obvious that the FFT bands in something like iZotope RX denote the number of bands a signal is split into\n\nNow, the whole point of splitting is so that we can do interesting and useful things to the various parts of the audio spectrum. Something like Oeksound Soothe allows us to do very trick control of a signal in somewhat more powerful ways than a typical multiband. There can be downsides (time domain blurring - more later) but oftentimes they are worth the price of entry\n\nNow, to the point of the post. The Linear/Logarithmic issue. Music/Audio is Logarithmic. What does that mean in practice? - let\u2019s take A440, the next octave up is A880 but the next octave doubles that to 1760 Hz (not 1320 as might be expected in a linear system). There are lots of videos about the deeper differences in Lin and log, SPL is another log domain which is why we use dB (a 3dB increase is double the power in an audio signal)",

I didn\u2019t know any of this until I was done with the mix and the whole time I thought it was a 50/50 if the vocals were recorded on the wired Apple earbuds mic (think TikTok singer-y), and the piano and strings were pretty unremarkable \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Also helps you tailor any sort of 'sweetening' type things for the program material -- ie, all of the electric guitars could use a little low mid boost and a little air up top.... but if you do that on the master, you fuck everything up. Just sort of a different way of thinking about staging your elements into the final mix bus. I find that with this method, the actual mix bus does less work and you get alot of the impact & loudness without many of the downsides.",

Leading to keyboards that had separate keys for Fsharp and Gflat !!

I got initially excited by Placeit, and it is great, but most things I try like convolutions tend to give me a plastic sheen that pulls me out of the mix. Just something to take the super dead feel from a vocal or a guitar that was recorded in an overly controlled room? A room or ambience and panned opposite has helped alright",

    "content": "Besides what the guys mentioned earlier and mastering the tools so you can work 'without thinking' about them, there's also the whole thing of the 'musicality' when it comes to tuning. It\u2019s not about getting everything to 0 cents for perfect tuning, but rather seeing what happens with the music, the chords, and what it\u2019s interacting with. A few years ago, I realized that the most intimate, soft songs often had a slight tuning drop, while the more energetic songs, where the voice pushed forward, tended to be a bit sharper in pitch. It\u2019s pretty crazy how just a few cents lower or higher can completely change the vibe. Lower tuning gives it a warmer, more muted color, while a few cents higher brings a different vibe, almost like it has more brightness or energy.",

I thought what I\u2019d been given wasn\u2019t good enough to get what I wanted . The turning point for me was realising I had started mixing the songs before I knew the parts , the nuance and strengths and weakness of the performances of those parts and the arrangements of them intimately . I didn\u2019t know all the vocalists lyrics or know the parts of their vocal range that distorted and those that sat perfectly . I realised I was effectively driving a car with my eyes shut . \nMy best offer would be : make sure you know everything inside out , and then mix again from scratch \u2026and with old school good balances and fader rides I bet you can bring it to life . \n\nIn knowing every aspect of the performances I was able to anticipate the parts and really bring the interplay of the band to life in the mix properly .

To add to @cian riordan 's point, it should often be pointed out (as I've seen Matt do a couple times) that the context and type of work someone like Jon Castelli recieves can significantly vary to someone who does low to mid-level type of stuff (bedroom artists, indie artists who are recording on their own or in a studio but with minimal vocal processing). \n\nI'm sure that with the type of work Jon C is getting that its probably true that he doesn't really need to compress since I'd bet most of the stuff he gets is already 50-60% done. \n\nIf you were watching the Josh Gudwin twitch stream today, then you would've seen another example of this. My guy pulled up the stems, pressed play and there was a literal mixed (albeit improvably so) song coming through. \n\ntl;dr: just remember that the nature of the audio your working with is likely vastly different than what someone like Jon Castelli is working with. (ie. stems coming in semi-mixed vs. mixing stems that have 0% processing on them)",

Then once you've possibly got something to work with, go through the usual steps you might process a vocal with  (more additive/tone-shaping tools to get a sound).\n\nThing is, if you don't have all these plugins already it would be much cheaper to just record a better vocal. (I think you can demo them all though?) Maybe even consider renting a studio for a day (if the artist has the budget).",

I can't seem to strike a good balance in this. Whenever I'm referencing I just can't seem to get it as bright and full at the same time. My vocals will either be very bright and sound cheap if that makes sense, and they will lack body. I just feels like they're not upfront enough and I just can't get them to shine in the overall mix. Some references of what I'm chasing could be this dutch rapper \"Hef\". And pop smoke seems to also have this very full but still very bright vocal sound. What are your techniques to achieve this?",

    "content": "This is really valuable! Thanks a lot. To go into some of your questions; I'm using Adam a7's (not the newer a7x's, although I tested them and they're wasn't as much of a difference as I had expected in my room). My room has been treated with diy panels, 14cm thick Rockwool and it sounds decent for a home recording studio. the dimensions aren't great and low lend monitoring isn't top of the charts but it's workable. Any peaks and valleys i did have have been sorted out further as much as possible with sonarworks which has really outdone my expectations. I also use Beyerdynamics dt770 pro's. \nUsually a lot of time does actually go into clip gaining, cleaning up and taking harshness out of vocals. I often take as much time just manually leveling a vocal, taking out esses etc as I do mixing. Fresh air and dopamine have indeed been big helpers and have been big steps towards that sizzle. Also the waves exciter in parallel has been working okay.\nI never seem to be able to get a multiband compressor to work well. Either I'm overdoing some of the setting or something because often i feel like it attenuates too much and other times to little in the places I want it to. I've noticed that a little boost in the low mids on pro-q3 that then also attenuates dynamically can work. \nCould you go into a bit more detail on what you mean with phase bringing a vocal more forward?\nI've also noticed that a lot of the sound I'm looking for comes from a certain sort of rolling kind of sound that might be coming from the rappers throat? I'm not sure at all about this but it seems like it's almost vocal fry but in a very natural way that is inherent to the singers/rappers voice. Idk if this is a rapping technique thing or if this is more accentuated in the mixing process, but it sounds really nice.\nDefinitely a big thankyou for all the tips!",

I\u2019m a little confused how that would work with latency.. maybe he is committing the fern or unfairchild on the vocals at some point, once he\u2019s got his ess and sibilants clip gained and then proceeds with the rest of the mix and dialing in the hardware and plugs on the 2bus. I know this is a wordy question, I hope that makes sense \u2764\ufe0f",

I've told her time and time again that perhaps these notes would have been more effective during production or recording, but it still feels like it's my fault.

Like JJ mixes sound amazing , there\u2019s no doubt the \u201csaving voltage \u201c approach makes a very impressive mix , but if you take a 36 chambers or old premiere production and turn up the volume so it\u2019s as \u201cloud \u201c as a modern hip hop radio record \u2026\u2026I feel like there\u2019s a lot of good stuff in there to hear and feel that modern filter everything to its own band mixes don\u2019t have \u2026.just a thought tho and I\u2019m currently very into x phase plug in lol",

More seating, TV screens for clients to watch, ISDN / Source Connect patching capabilities for Voice Over Recording.  Way way less outboard.  Another big thing is Soundminer, an application used for SFX file implementation/organization. Very handy. \n\na large TV screen, Soundminer, certain plugins (Nugen VisLim), 5.1 mixing capabilities, Source Connect connection, are probably the *biggest* things that a recording studio might not have. It's more that they're just way stripped down in comparison to music studios. \n\nAs far as design, they're just usually really simple, clean, it's more meant for corporate clients and less for \"vibing out\" with musicians. It's a very different feeling world. I have no idea if this answers your question, but a recording studio should be able to do almost anything you'd need for post production, it's more about convenience when clients/creatives are in the room.",

And those decisions are hard to make until I\u2019ve heard the song and can see what stems I have to work from. I\u2019ve just gotten too many sessions from people where there is so much bussing and subgrouping going on that by the time the vocal gets to the mix bus, it is passed through 3 instances off gullfoss and 4 different compressors and there is zero life in it. It quickly gets out of control. I actually find minimal bussing to be a quicker workflow because I don\u2019t have to follow a whole series of subgroups to know the entire processing chain on a given audio source when I\u2019m trying to make a tweak, nor will that tweak affect any other element that is sitting just fine. That\u2019s just my brain though.",

It\u2019s rare that someone is singing into a decent mic and pre in a treated room (studio!?) or that they bother with mic technique.\n\nDoes anyone have tips or resources related to *really* digging into the repair of things like wonky room resonances, harsh-ass mics, inconsistent distance, and sometimes no talent? It seems like the folks working in that next level up can wave a magic wand and turn an NT1A into a 251 without harshness or dullness.\n\nI always thought vocal recording was pretty clear cut.

The track comes alive with harmonics without being \u201cwoah that\u2019s distorted\u201d, and I\u2019ve always viewed them more for that effect rather than just a \u201cgain controller\u201dIf you have your own 1176 that you can really spend time with, you can figure out just where in the needle that magic happens. THEN you can use something ultra transparent and awesome like a Dave Hills titan to control dynamic on the way in and really increase your chances of keeping the vocal right in the magic spot without risking overs. \ud83e\ude84 You can do it with a studio\u2019s 1176, you just have to figure out the sweet spot before the artist gets there and be willing to adjust on the fly",

That\u2019s when dividing it up and moving the blobs to draw in smooth transition between the notes help. Attack time is what I use if I need further smoothing between those divided blobs",

    "content": "I can relate to this . I think first impression notes are a great tool and I\u2019m challenging myself to \u201cdo less \u201c not more to roughs:demos . Often times when I\u2019m tracking vocals it is to a two track (rnb/hip-hop) and I\u2019ve learnt that just about any \u201cvocal sound \u201c I want to go for I better get it whilst we are tracking because the artists always want a rough vocal mix to go away with at end of session . Invariably , whatever that rough sounds like I can\u2019t stray away from (for good or bad ) once they\u2019ve heard it . And then when it comes to a final mix , it gets even more complicated getting the actual stems for the two track and mixing it all down with the vocal tracks as it often (imo) sounds better but doesn\u2019t feel the same as that on the day rough vocal mix to the two track . I realised there\u2019s no way I can get an artist to unhear that first  rough mix and I\u2019m wasting hours mixing it all over again with the stems , like I\u2019m re inventing a wheel no one wants . I\u2019ve noticed @Bainz_  telling @oaklandmatt he had the same issues with thugs punk album and also have heard Jason Goldberg and Stuart white embracing the idea that you\u2019re possibly mixing the final mix/pre master as you track . It\u2019s a very raw and quick approach and it does keep you miles away from overmixing something . I embraced it as a workflow only recently and it\u2019s less stressful than working your ass off on a \u201cperfect\u201d mix only to get back they prefer the vibe of the first day mix .   top tips not to overmix I am meditating on currently are : don\u2019t lose your dynamics , watch your phase relationships don\u2019t change , leave some mistakes in , automate more than compress and be quick",

I think it\u2019s SO easy to become acclimated to the thing you\u2019ve been listening to for 4-8 hours that a quick perusal of some familiar music is a great reset.

On average I'm probably around the 8-12 hours actively mixing mark and editing can sometimes be an additional day or two per track especially if it's a heavily layered track.  It really depends on what comes in.  I've only been at it full time for about 3 years so I'm hoping I can get a little more confident in my moves over time as my monitoring improves and my ears get more refined but there's still a lot of work for me that goes into getting things to feel right.",

    "content": "@oaklandmatt Great episode yesterday! \n\nYou did leave me a little curious tho! You said, you were handing in your first ableton mix. (I hope you did a short square wave blip at the beginning and end or @BatMeckley might come after you and your not sample accurate multitracks \ud83d\ude05)\n\nYou said you got your vocal mix in protools and then pulled it into ableton, for practical reasons. Does that mean you bounced the wet vocal and just had a vocal track, and mixed the beat around that or did you bounce the dry vocal and recreate your chain from protools, so you\u2019d still be able to tweak it in ableton? Curious about this workflow, because I like yourself also always produce in ableton, and record people outside of ableton.",

As previously mentioned here , I encounter artists who have some ideas about the technical side but are incorrect in their understanding, but want to instruct you on how they want something done (tracking ) . Simplest example: \u201c put cla vocals on the hook . My producer mind says \u201cchild please \u201c , my engineer mind says \u201c what do I say to that ?\u201d. So, is there a time to be assertive when in the engineer role , or as you put it ruari, the service role",

Or if the other instruments are doing things that aren\u2019t meaningful to the arrangement, it can get contribute to bass notes getting lost as well. \nTry muting other stuff one at a time until you can hear the bass well, and evaluate why the bass isn\u2019t cutting through. \n\nSometimes, you just gotta zoom out and mute the bass and mix the song without the bass and put it in. Before you do this, save as and solo vocals (if there is any) bass and drums (sometimes one other most important/prominent element in the arrangement on top of that) and make that work first. You can get it to a point of making the mix work this way if there is one element that just doesn\u2019t sit well in the mix.",

Lets the mixer and and ME worry about loudness, and let the singer be creative and sing what they feel, how they feel they can create the biggest connection. I Think its the same with a mix engineer, let them mix it to their best ability and creativness, and let the ME worry about the last QC, before sending it out to the people.",

It's usually the last thing I address in my mixes and it just becomes this tedious game of making them find a home in the rest of the track and not stepping on the lead.\n\nAny strategies for making them blend or feel distinct from the lead vocal?",

I myself also make a lot of dance music whilst also doing a lot of production work as my main job and it\u2019s a completely different process.\nI think for dance music / electronic music, many people have omitted the concept of mastering altogether. I think the bulk of the process is already done in production and they have the sound dialled in exactly as they like and are only looking for gain / desired LUFS. I also often do that for my dance music stuff.\nWhereas production for vocalists, there\u2019s the pre-pro, pro, recording, mixing and mastering all as separate processes.\nI find it really interesting personally. So many ways and methods.\n\nP.S. I often wondered why some tracks would just clip like crazy in my dj sets. Now I know. Haha",

Give a wild boost on area where I want the delay to cut through and turn the overall delay down - and then compress it a little bit to duck it. \n\nAt least for reverb- I find it\u2019s not always necessarily to have a dry signal keying the compressor to duck the reverb.  Sometimes just a compressor directly on the channel will do something similar and less dramatic than ducking if that\u2019s what is needed for the song, \n\nAlso I find faders very helpful in automating effects. Because I don\u2019t always want them to duck in the same shape or ducking is something I\u2019d do to change the nature of the tail and will still need some additional shaping to give specialness to different moments.\n\nFor vocals I like copying the audio track and make separate fx tracks because I only want it on certain words. Even for overall effect, I use a separate track so I can take out certain words from reverb or clip gain them. Or even fade in words when I don\u2019t want the early part of reverb poking out too much in certain parts.",

I see on wiki that they had to give an interpolation credit to sting for talkback after all .

I was wondering if you have good tips for (maybe even specific) compressors / saturators to help me out leveling them up without losing the feel. Maybe get me through some good bit of work before I finish balancing with automation. Anything you've used before with good results? So far I've used a usual suspects \u2014 pair of COMP-2A and 1176, I've tried my variable gain compressor (which I don't usually use for vocals) and both worked okay-ish, but I was looking for maybe a good plugin so I can streamline my process a little bit rather than bouncing the vocal tracks through hardware all the time.\nAppreciate your input.",

I started using them itb after Leon Zervos who masters at 301 where I work but used to work at Sterling (where he mastered classics like mambo nr 5, the macarena, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5 etc.) recommended them & spoke about the same \u201cdancing\u201d thing that @spectrummasters spoke about. After that I also got another 2  lessons by 301 mastering engineers (one who\u2019s won like 19 aria - australian grammies & been nominated for like 90) - once where I gave a floortom too much bottom end $ & that really triggered a mastering compressor limiting him in some way & he showed me how the left side jumped on the vu - I didn\u2019t hear it at all in the mixing room but could hear it clearly in the mastering room. The other engineer showed me the same thing this time with a powerful lead vocal. This was kinda back when the loudness wars were still a bit more relevant & when I delivered quiter mixes & left them more space to do their thing & these energy bursts limited the final loudness potential. Then I saw that same Jacquire King thing & together all this made me think of how useful the VU is if you\u2019re working in less than ideal bass monitoring environment - it really shows the bass energy in a pretty unique way. I like listening to references (check the bass VU on for instance Jon Castelli\u2019s Khalid Talk vs Sza Low - one very kick focused & one super sub focussed - both a fuckton of low end vs Serban Blinding Lights try -7 as the reference - BL hovers around 0 & is louder lufs wise & then try Fleetwood Mac Dreams (I think the 2012 remaster) - softer, nice transients, beautiful bass - being driven by Kick,snare & bass) - all of those \u201cdance\u201d with the groove.",

I've heard that very often brass instruments like trumpets and also male vocals can produce these sort of waveforms.\nI'm working on a male vocal pop ballad and the vocal is quite asymmetrical, i'm concerned this will mess with compression and limiting and the overall loudness I will be able to get. I have \"corrected\" the asymmetrical waveform using phase rotation in rx. Is it common practice to use phase rotators/all-pass filters to make these waveforms more symmetrical? or do these things do more harm than good? what are your approaches to this? Thanks a lot\nvideos on the subject: https://youtu.be/dAzjq6vldkc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSV5ocyfKLA",

I mixed the whole thing in one Pro Tools session, with a separate set of channels for each song which I\u2019d then make inactive and move onto the next song. When printing the continuous mix at the end, I\u2019d make active two songs at a time for any overlap, and constructed the long printed mix like that.\n\nIn this case though, there are multimiced drums, bass, electric guitars, keyboards, vocals. The recordings are good (from the stereo board mixes I\u2019ve heard) and the scale is such that I want to have the fidelity I\u2019d approach a studio record with, and the room to shape an identity for each song (while still sounding like they all happened on the same stage on the same night) so I\u2019m thinking to use my usual elaborate drum mix routing with parallels etc, all the bells and whistles.\n\nThis complexity would put me off mixing 23 songs in one session, but I\u2019m thinking of the inevitable crunch at the end of the project and the potential frustration of jumping between sessions.\n\nAm I thinking too deeply about this? Should I just get a drum sound and leave it there for 23 tracks, with a few rides here and there?\n\nNot much experience with this stuff so any thoughts would be very welcome please!",

I believe @cian riordan routes this way as well (though I'm not sure how much processing he does on each buss). I will say it's nice to have the vocals all coming out the same aux so I can pop them all down 0.3dB at the end or tame some unneeded brightness. Also not doing much compression on either buss. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I hear the proximity effect in the vocals, and i dont think there is any compression applied, but if you hear any let me know what type of compression/compressor she might have used to get that very  subtle effect to her vocals. \n\n3.

I said \u201cWhen I find myself using too many stereo imagers to make things fit, sometimes I\u2019ll check to see what kind of fuckery I\u2019m causing. But honestly who listens in mono anymore?\u201d\n\nHe reminded me a lot of small Bluetooth speakers are in mono, so I decided this morning to take a fresh look at a tune I\u2019m producing/mixing, starting in mono. \n\nThe leveling choices totally broke down when I switched to stereo, but I think the mix is much better and it happened faster cause I was forced to look at the eq in relation to the center elements, so even when I spread them back out there was more room for the vocal kik snare bass to speak. \n\nY\u2019all ever start a mix in mono? Or work with mono as a tool for extended periods?",

I always do a quiet listen or a headphone city walk to see if I loose important elements in the quiet bits to make sure I don\u2019t overshoot the dynamics. Also don\u2019t get stuck in a loop of just one section for too long. Also sometimes I start the intro a little louder and slowly let the volume settle to where I actually want it in the verse if I want it to actually be a bit more dynamic\u2026 just a subtle bump of the intro guitar/piano etc then let it settle under the vocal can help it appear loud enough in a playlist off the top and still let you have some contrast from verse to chorus. I know I said two conflicting things- depends on the arrangement",

It\u2019s basically a group volume ride for frequencies instead of tracks. You can also do this on individual stereo tracks if just panning isn\u2019t granular enough. \n\nThe why & when is mostly about taste. I tend to mix into a proQ3 setting that has the sides hi passed around 100 for the same reason I have a pultec boosting highs & lows on the master- it just ends up doing a lot of work for me.\n\nIt can become problematic if I\u2019ve got big toms in a song and, after I\u2019ve got a mix starting to cook I\u2019ll toggle it on & off to see if I\u2019m doing more harm than good. For the kind of music I mostly do, it works more often than not, but the one song I sent to Cian for mixing he basically blasted me for doing that. (In his own kind and gentle way.)\n\nBut m/s eq isn\u2019t just for the master buss. You can think about it for any stereo track. Sometimes, I have an acoustic that\u2019s carrying the whole song, but the fundamentals are fighting with the vocal, so I\u2019ll turn the mid down at that frequency (or side chain that to the vocal if it feels anemic when the vocal is out.) that leaves the sides as big as you like cause it\u2019s not fighting with my mono vocal.",

RMS on all stayed within the -14 to -16 range. \n\nSnares peaks was about 1dB louder than the kick on all tracks and ranged between 8.5 and 11. Rms sat between -22 and -24 on all. Ava Max is exluded cause there was a kick on the snare stem. \n\nHigh end percs had peaks around -20 to -25 and rms around -35-40. \n\non the All BASS channel the peaks varied a bit more ranging between -8.5 and -12dB.

For rms they were all around 15-16 apart from 1975 again hitting -18. \n\nThe All Music Group all had an RMS of -18 to -20 but the peaks varied -6dB to -11dB\n\nthe LDV group (which sometimes also had the BGVs in the stem) varied more than I thought and had peaks between -7 and -14.5.

First time im posting something like this, so I wanted to ask where the right place is for it ? \n\nIm busy working on a self produced track, the vocal is extremely stylistically processed , and theres things about it that I love and things about it that are very jarring and just objectively bad. Mostly sounds/feels like phase issues but I cant pinpoint exactly how to approach the issue. Where on this discord would be the right place to maybe upload a sample and try get some much needed perspective on it ?",

Attenuating a few frequency hotspots and clicks is more than half of it. Unlike Jack, I use mouth declick far more than spectral repair or declick. \n\nThere\u2019s other things I\u2019m doing as well but they vary from song to song. I\u2019ll manually smooth out plosives, mic stand bumps, clothing rustles etc. I\u2019ve even gone through and reduced the aliasing in a processed vocal (which takes fucking forever to lasso tool). \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve never seen anyone mention before is fades in RX. It\u2019s a little hard to explain so I\u2019d have to make a video for this, but I do frequency dependent fading. If you think about it, almost all sounds decay with the high end decaying faster than the low end, so when I\u2019m fading noise floor I do the same and the result is more natural and invisible.",

Then\u2014and this is why I start with this layout\u2014I name the \"x_PRINT\" track as needed (\"GTR_LD\"). This way I don't have to have pre-named busses that may or may not make any sense for the mix; I can just quickly go through and name based on what's below the print track. THEN I split eveything out so it doesn't look like an insane cluster; the print tracks go in the \"STEMS\" folder, the buss tracks go in the \"BUSSES\" folder, and all the audio tracks go in either the \"MUSIC\" or \"VOCALS\" folder. I am increasingly rarely using aux sends on a global level, so the \"FX\" stuff at the bottom is just there to quickly pull in and assign to a buss as needed. Otherwise I'm dup-ing tracks and putting FX there, or just putting FX inline on the track\u2014*gasp!* The first three tracks are just there so I can flip to them quickly on my S1 and listen to the ref, the mix, or the stems (barely used).",

I started paying attention to the mix and thought it didn\u2019t sound great. Mainly focusing on the vocals (ss\u2019s seem kinda loud, something doesn\u2019t feel full bodied etc\u2026) and just to compare, thinking that\u2019s probably the sound of modern pop and I just forget to pay attention, I went to listen to \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now\u201d which is a fair contender in terms of style and production and was blown away by how much better it sounds to my ears\u2026 Would love to get everyone\u2019s opinion on it, is this just my taste or the Barbie mix is objectively worse (maybe because of movie deadlines etc\u2026)",

It's not as aggressive, it's more vocal forward, and evokes a sort of fantasy vibe. It's impossible to say what goes on behind closed doors but it doesn't sound particularly horrible to me.

It may sound too smooth in the midrange solo-ed, but when you have 3 elements each with a -2dB cut around 2k, you\u2019re making a sort of \u201c-6dB\u201d hole for the vocal.

In this instance I\u2019d use pre delay in the reverb and darken the reverb  to achieve this.",

What I've found is that once I compress one thing,  I find myself going,  \"Oh, this thing needs to be brought up, and then this thing and then this thing...\" and then I end up in a \"loudness war\" with myself. I know tons of people who compress the day lights out of everything, and more power to them. Sometimes I wish I could make it work for me... I also find compression somehow takes away from the impact of things as well, in a way.",

But when I don\u2019t high pass my vocals past 100-120 hz, my vocals sounds too boomy, like the low end of my vocals is too overpowering the mix when I play it in my car\u2026. Is there a way I can go around this?\n\n2. Other than delay throws, When people put a constant delay on vocals it seems like they want the delay to be felt not heard\u2026.. if this is the case, how does the delay not being heard help the mix\u2026.? Or am I just thinking too deep into it?\nThanks in advance",

You can get similar amounts of attenuation and the shape of the phase rotation feels a little less fake.\n\n- how much of this are you doing in solo? Often the phase fuckery bothers me in solo and doesn\u2019t as soon as the 808 is bumping. \n\n- sometimes I just let the lowend be loose and say \u201cfuck it. My mix, my aesthetic choice\u201d.

Another dip in the dunning kruger effect happening unfortunately and im starting to compare my mixes again to the goats. \n\nIve been down the serban rabbit hole the last week and i think the one thing that i want to improve upon that is inspired by him is more midrange clarity. The feeling that almost nothing is being masked. Like everything has a home. Has anyone had that \u201caha!\u201d moment and could share some tips on carving space for vocal/overall mix clarity. I love my mixes overall, but nitpicking on what i could improve, so any tips are super appreciated!",

I've also used RX De-bleed to try getting a little more separation before diving in so that i only have to melodyne the vocal in monophonic mode.

I'm hitting my multiband different, hitting my clipper different, hitting my limiter different; so if I were to simply execute that note, now the vocal, guitar, pretty much everything shifts a good bit in energy and I then spend time making the mix work again now that a big chunk of energy got pushed up in it. (side note - I like to mix a bit more gentle/tight on the low-end side since the lows are so hot in car systems, headphones, entertainment centers, etc. these days. Midrange is my home base.)

    "content": "I'm mixing a batch of songs for an artist and I'm stuck on the first one\u2014it's got one of the most insanely frustrating vocal recordings I've worked with, and I can't seem to finish it. I don't like sending out V1s to a new client that I'm not super psyched about, and by now I've told the guy a couple times \"I'll have it over to you tomorrow morning!\" and then I listen back and have to push back again. There's no real deadline (he told me \"by the end of the year, please!\" when we first spoke), and I think he's local, and with all of that in mind I'm tempted to just send him what I've got and say \"this vocal was a bear\u2014come over and re-track it if you're not 100% in love with it\" (but worded more carefully). He's paying my full rate and honestly just re-recording inclusive of my rate sounds way easier than fighting my way through 3 more songs of this at this point. Any thoughts from the hive mind on how to approach this?",

This happens to me from time to time, not always that extreme tho.\n\nGenerally my first move is to listen while bypassing each thing and trying to identify what it\u2019s making better and what gets worse, then if I decide to try and keep some of them I\u2019ll attempt to move some of those plugs off the main mix buss and back onto a subgroup or instrumental buss. But no matter what it ends up with me looping sections and rebuilding the mix to match the rough vibe before I get into the actual creative fun part of the mix.\n\nI have one producer i work with often who mixes into a comp on his all vocal buss and it\u2019s slow and hitting like 3-6 db compression. It totally bones me while mixing so I usually end up rebalancing all the vocals section by section to match his mix before I \u201cstart mixing\u201d. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll just work into their buss shit and bypass the stuff/bands of each of plug that are only hurting and not helping. \n\nReal can of worms tbh. \n\nLast week I ran into the vocal buss issue- luckily it was a comp w side chain input so I did try out the sidechain, I pre fader sent all the tracks feeding it while copying automation to that send, then used a master fader to match the buss sc level to the original comps gain reduction  and it worked well in that situation and untied my hands while saving me from a whole vocal rebalance session. First time that approach ever actually worked though for me tbh. If its a comp that drums are driving into i find the sc input doesnt end up feeling the same usually.",

Me - I only consistently find it useful in two places. 1: Vocals as essentially a volume leveler. 2: Bass - For whatever reason, I really like the sound a very \"pinned down\" bass. Other than that, I haven't found compression very helpful. I'm always hearing of people going crazy with it and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out?? - Especially with drums?? I can see what it's doing when I apply it - to the drums - but I just don't find that I ever produce a very helpful or flattering result... And golly - A little while back I was working on one of my songs with a mixer whom I hold in VERY high regard. He was guiding me through my mix with his methods - Basically using parallel compression on everything, and I remember distinctly feeling several times as though my \"hands were tied\" - The session felt very \"stiff\" with all that going on.

Back bus gets compressed more aggressively than I would do a mix bus. Blend that under the mix bus to taste. Really good for locking all the instrumentation together around vocals without dynamics getting pulled around by the drums. I think Andrew uses some kind of 1176 but the idea works with all kinds of compressors.\n\nMix bus and backbus both feed into a 2-bus where more processing may happen. Something like Pultec EQP1q, tape emultion, Pro L2? But I like to change things up!",

I didn\u2019t notice it really when tracking. It\u2019s paired with a very low mid heavy vocal so it\u2019s making adding high end and clarity difficult. I blamed my chain for days but when I opened another vocal done through the exact same chain the following day from another artist it was like butter so it\u2019s obviously inherent to the vocal which makes sense in hindsight.  \n\nAny ideas on how to bring out some more clarity in the top end and not exaggerate that? I\u2019ve tried sooth, had a brief look at declicking in rx, spectre. What\u2019s worked the best so far has been using Accentize spectral balancer to clamp the top end and then clariphonic to bring it back up and that has helped. \n\nIt\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019d imagine rx to reduce the noisy component in that frequency range would help but your air is essentially a noisy component. \n\nAnyone ever came across this grain? \n\nThe style of music doesn\u2019t demand crazy top end so I could just embrace the warmth but I\u2019d love a bit more articulation. \n\nSorry for the long post",

Transient control, room ambience, obviously pure level? \n\nAny thoughts on this? I suppose I\u2019m talking about front to back depth but without making it seem too obvious. I see some guys using compression over the instrument buss that\u2019s grabbing the instruments and holding them at a certain level and letting the vocal Poke above. I\u2019d imagine this contrast in attacks would create that separation. \n\nAnother example might be having a tambourine or shaker that inherently have a bright and transient nature that is also able to appear as if it\u2019s not up front.",

Every extra minute spent on trying to iron it all out there will save you hours in editing and mixing. I\u2019ve often considered selling a piece of gear and then had a really stellar vocal go through only to realise there was nothing wrong with the gear. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of reading it but the performance is everything. You can\u2019t REALLY EQ air and body into a vocal that isn\u2019t there. You can\u2019t try simulate it alright. And you can\u2019t create actual excitement with compression, just try and trick the brain into thinking there\u2019s excitement. A 57 into any preamp into any interface with a stellar performance will sound amazing. \n\nAfter that is just treatment, and it\u2019s essentially pointless discussing chains because it\u2019s so song and vision dependant. \n\nA boring answer I know but you\u2019ll save a lot of headache and heart ache the sooner you learn it. \n\nIt\u2019s like when you hear a new compressor plugin just explode a drum room and it sounds amazing. Analogue glue, explosive release, so much groove. And then you slap it on the lacklustre room and performance you actually have in front of you and it doesn\u2019t seem to sound so amazing any more.",

    "content": "I'm struggling a bit with a vocal for an album I'm mixing at the moment. It's a female singer, sort of in a post-Phoebe Bridgers world or something like that. The vocal recording have this layer of what I think of as grainy distortion over them that feels sort of seperated from the actual meaningful musical information, and when I try to polish them up and make them nice and big and beautiful this pops out even more. Also, there's pronounced proximity effect on them as well, so I sort of feel like I can't work effectively with the top end and I can't make them big in the low mids either and just whatever I do sort of make them a little worse. Don't love the feeling, haha. Anyways, how would you guys go on about something like this?",

    "content": "Yeah, love soothe, using it to control  the low mid resonances on this thus far. Maybe I could dig in a bit harder for the highs with it. Bloom didn\u2019t work, it made it sound a bit more plastic-y and actually made the grainyness more pronounced. I haven\u2019t gotten good results with bloom on female vocals so far, but I know that one day it will be just the thing needed. I think that probably RX will yield the best results, but for some reason I find myself resisting digging in with RX on this, probably because I know it\u2019s going to be hard work and I\u2019m a little lazy. Good lazy, though, because if I\u2019m not I try too hard and end up taking away what\u2019s good. \n\nI don\u2019t have Ozone, but maybe this is what will push me over the edge to try it, hmmm. \n\nI was thinking that maybe some sort of tape thing could work, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work with Tupe inmediately and the UAD Ampex made it brighter and more distorted. It kind of feels like it\u2019s already on the edge of breaking up too much and becoming unpleasant, a bit like being touched softly on the arm when you have a fever and it\u2019s almost painful. Hmm, now I\u2019m just blabbering on. I\u2019ll stop for now. Thank you for your suggestion!",

Nothing is sitting down for me, I can't get depth, width, anything and all it's got to the stage i think where I have given myself a complex about. I start chasing references, cant see the wood for the trees and getting lost in detalis etc. Ive switched from focusing on getting a tone happening to just working really quickly, working on headphones, working on headphones with room sims, working in mono, band limiting myself to just the mids. Starting with the kick, starting with the vocal, starting all faders up, but I think I've just spooked myself now.",

I lean heavily \u201cvocal > everything\u201d when I mix, and nearly every time I do this bandpassing reframe I notice something I\u2019d missed in the interplay between the rest of the elements and the whole project is upgraded as a result. \n\nI think it\u2019s totally fair to warn against the pitfalls of such maneuvers in the same way that it\u2019s fair to warn against abusing energy drinks, but when it\u2019s just once a week before an intense workout, an energy drink is actually a big win with little to no downside.",

I'm sure there's a more efficient way to do it though, so if you guys know, I would be very happy to hear them!",

Listening at low levles helps a lot with balancing throughout, solo safe against other instruments / groups to find what to cut to make space for vocals  (with time you'll find this to be intuitive), I'll add something to the convo, when I had new assistants in to help them place the vocal I'd tell them to solo drums + bass + vocals and adjust level of the vocals - and that'd be a great a starting point, additonally I'd have them press the mono button with everything playing on the controller and listen at conversational level to ride it, and sometimes I'd suggest to create a \"harmonics\" group with all the gtrs, piano, banjos whatever and just see what the mids of those would sound like vs vocal, if they put spreader/doubler, we'd check sides only too",

I've found that when I apply it, the reverb itself can get lost within everything else, even after panning and whatnot. Is it a matter of shifting the EQ on the vocals or shifting the EQ on the instrumentals? (Or it's nothing having to do with EQ at all, haha)\n\nA really swell example I like to use is Sabrina Carpenter's vocals on \"Don't Smile\". There's very huge, wide reverb going on within the vocal chain and it creates such a warm, dreamy soundscape. It almost sounds like the instrumentals were all pulled back, but the vocals were still glued in there very nicely.",

The high frequency we added was in the right direction, but it was bringing out the texture and the note at the same time.

I love these!\" And it was literally a piece of gear that accentuated the \"breathy aspect\" of vocals. Like, a \"breath exciter.\" Once i saw that I KNEW mixing went deep.

    "content": "anyone want to have a chat about **clip gaining vocals** in a beginner friendly way?\n\nI recently cold DMd some random discord artists who sent me a few things to be able to practice mixing. Im totally new to doing any kind of intentional or thorough mixing. I got back beginner stuff (hip hop) and so far only two track projects,;so I'm primarily focused on vocal clean up, mix, and production. \n\nI have a vocal that is loud and energetic but I believe was recorded too close to the mic (or too loudly). I cleaned up the take in RX as best I could and did some slight de-clipping on the really bad peaks. I've imported it back to PT, and took some of the basic tips from the podcast notes into consideration. I want to clip gain the vocal and try to even it out without being transformative or destructive of the performance, but still taking enough liberties to improve it and learn something.",

    "content": "I already had the instinct myself to use clip gain a good bit when I record my friend or demos for my friend, so I was excited to get the validation about how useful/important this can be (especially for weaker performers), but thinking of how to holistically do it with the intention of prepping the vocal is causing a bit of overthink perhaps. There's also the question of more granular clip gain for de-essing or plosives, etc., that makes me wonder what would be overdoing it or what is even needed and how to judge that.\n\nUsually any \"mixing\" or editing I do is related to ideas I create or am part of capturing and have vision/inspiration and get some level of enjoyment out of it. This inspiration usually provides intention or some direction even in my ignorance. In this case I'm completely detached and uninspired essentially, while this makes me more objective, I have a hard time hearing where I want to take the vocal. \n\nI would appreciate some perspective and insight into the granular thought process one might take with the source material I have, having more experience and know-how. I will push through on my own and seek out feedback that way as well, but some live soundboarding would be nice. I appreciate you regardless if you read this and if you have any input at all. ty!!\n\nIf you are interested in listening or discussing it, ping or DM me. We could chat about it in vc and I could stream. Thanks again, I hope good discussion can come of this in a way that is granular or useful for curious beginners.",

Tough to gauge how much of it is coming from an actual shift in perspective on our role, or if people aren\u2019t listening as clinically until mix time, or if it\u2019s just sheer procrastination/indecision in the final hour. I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s a moot point but it\u2019s really been happening more often enough to get me thinking about it. \n\nCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve had a lot of success with setting boundaries or renegotiating when this stuff happens, though, so very curious what y\u2019all are doing. I\u2019m more amenable to any of the above when we\u2019re doing full rate, of course, but the irony I find is it\u2019s less likely to happen on those projects \u2013 and when it does they\u2019re prob more willing and able to adjust. \n\nAlso there are a variety of shades of this that  feel very different to me. Some version of, \u201chey, do you do vocal tuning?\u201d is a pretty different ask than, \u201cYooo can we tune these vocals?\u201d The former obviously starts a proper conversation about it; the latter puts me in a position of feeling like I\u2019m pulling some \u201chidden fees\u201d from behind my back. Feels icky when our collective goal is to get the record finished, and I usually just end up caving. Which in turn perpetuates the cycle, and so on\u2026",

Another potential hurdle in the case of working with something so raw is doing the vocal production from the ground up and making creative and technical choices on that end. \n\nI surely have to put in my time shooting from the hip but I'm actively looking for collaboration online and in person/studios to try to close that knowledge gap and get creative help translating my thoughts into execution on a technical level. But yes I agree that it is that simple and that generally is my approach to everything. I trust my own taste and curation but a more laser focused level, I don't think I have the experience or ear to even be sure about what I'm hearing or how to get to what I'm hearing in my head every time.",

I'm the type to bite off more than I can chew, but I usually don't mind the consequences of that. I actually have another song from a different artist that is much better, maybe I'll start with that. To be fair my question was very open ended since in reality I'm also just wondering how to approach a vocal chain and vocal production beyond simply copying a preset or blindly adjusting settings on various plug ins. Something like an eq, or even other things like saturation or simple sidechain on a reverb is simple enough to somewhat understand, but the culmination of various settings and layered effects does start to get complicated and a bit unintuitive.\n\nI think fundamentally I need more attempts and practice struggling on my own, but I also think it's helpful to see if at some point I can find a bit of guidance or collaboration to accelerate my learning and focus my vision and efforts more efficiently. I appreciate your response and will try to not overthink it and focus mainly on leveling the bars to taste and moving on to practice some tuning on the vocal after. Thanks again !",

    "content": "Thank you Cian. Yeah your chain is making a lot of sense to me. I most likely don't need to be doing all this extra parallel stuff lol. rn I have the vocal pretty much balanced and sitting well in the mix dynamically and tonally with eq (static and dynamic), and compression (1176 into rvox) etc... i guess i am looking for some ways to add like aggression or forwardness to the vocal in a designed way. kinda like how I designed my snares transient shape with compressors. I think ive heard of people using certain compressors to like add attack to the beginning of consonants and stuff like that. Is this a thing? or maybe are there other cool secret parallel effects/processes that might add some energy to my vocal? it's a kinda hard rocking big fuzzy guitars, crashing cymbals type song, you know?",

The vocal on this most recent track went through TLA-100, Sansamp, blue stripe, distressor, Fairchild, and another parallel with inflator and some other stuff on it. They all sound cool you really can just build the vocal by messing with the faders. Most important thing to that amount of parallel is that each one is only doing like 1 dB of compression. So sometimes you need pre compression to even things out before they hit all those. And yes you definitely need to pull back some 300 which really starts to build up. Other than that it\u2019s been an amazing tool",

That tends to be most useful when the phrase timing does not work, ie. too short for the timing of the phrase.

To me it sounds like you're still producing the song. These kinds of things happen during mix sometimes, I fly in vocal fixes, etc. But usually in service of committing to a finished song.",

A part of my growth as a mixer has been accepting that my contribution can be objectively very small but still valuable nonetheless. An above average producer\u2019s time is better spent working on another song. I can take a lot off their plate spending an extra hour on EQ, another hour going deep on vocal automation/edit cleanup. That can feel priceless to a busy producer/artist team.",

(for ex, i might level the beat to a vocal one way in the daw, and later in my mp3 player ill think wow the beat is too loud/quiet etc.",
