They\u2019ve been in the game a long time, have racked up a Grammy win and multiple noms, and I\u2019ve been a fan of their work since college. Feels pretty good. Huge thanks to this discord. Really can\u2019t say it enough. I have made greater strides in my engineering chops since joining here than at any other point in my career. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nProducer told me that everyone wanted to go with the other person before blind listen because no one knew who I was and that my mix alleviated the insecurities about the production and felt like what the song wanted to be which might have been the sweetest.\n\nOn to mix two! \ud83e\udee1",

    "content": "Ok, so that's a quick summary of the four main types of comp. My suggestion is to pick one model from each category. One and only one. Forget the rest for a while. Start trying it in various places to get a feel for what it does well and how you can use it to shape sounds, to serve the song. The actual plug you choose matters much less than the intrinsic characteristic of the category\n\nLast thought, 99% percent of what I see online in the form or tutorials etc re compression is nonsense, even from some very good friends of mine. Parallel compression for example can be wonderful, but using it as the only workflow on everything for *religious* reasons is just plain silly\n\nTake your time and spend a week with your chosen plug in from each category. Maybe ask here for examples of different styles in real records, Jimmy Pages' acoustic guitars for example. You'll get a sense for it over a little while\n\nOK, QC time over\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n@Slow Hand please feel free to edit this to tighten it up",

We all know it can turn for the worst next year, but for now\u2026 it\u2019s good. And you guys and the conversations we had here all had a hand in it.\n\nCheers!",

I\u2019m lucky to have a great network of successful record makers here in LA and everyone has stressed about this at one time or another. It\u2019s just part of the game.\n* People can disagree with me here, but I would personally avoid the urge to tell your clients/IG followers/the general public that your schedule is free. Like Ryan said, it\u2019s not a good look and devalues your brand. Not to mention if you\u2019re not one of the people constantly spamming your warez on social media, and all of sudden you are, it might come off strange.\n* Realize that that tides can turn any minute. The phone *will* ring. And when it does, it\u2019s sometimes a plus to have a free schedule and to say something like \u201cjust had a project get pushed out so I can actually start on this sooner rather than later\u201d, etc.\n* It\u2019s also a great opportunity to dive into busywork/maintenance around the studio. Patchbay reworking, gear repair, workflow improvements, computer upgrades. Not to mention keeping up your online appearances\u2026 new website, updating discography, etc.\n* Start hanging out with people. Don\u2019t stay home and bite your nails. You know people making records in your area \u2014 ask em out for coffee/dinner/drinks. Being social eases the anxiety and also reminds people you\u2019re out there in the world, excited to make records.\n\nHang tough, it\u2019ll pass.",

That means they have to produce content. The more content the better, because you need to feed the algorithm and compete with everyone else producing content.\n\nThe problem for people learning how to make records is that no one tells you that 90%+ of learning is simply doing. All the tips and tricks are nice and interesting and sometimes inspiring, but until you're at a high level, you should just be making a shit ton of records.\n\nIt's not a good way to build your brand to just say: get off your phone and go make records.\n\nBut that is how all of the best people become the best.",

After finishing it and sending it off, I took a moment to reflect on why it turned out so well. (Regardless of the fact that it's a great song, excellently recorded and produced, with a very talented artist).\n\nA big part of it, I realized, is because I'm in such a great place personally right now. I recently moved to a small mountain town with my girlfriend for an indefinite stay, and just last week, we found out we're expecting our first child. The sheer joy and connection to my surroundings are absolutely crucial obviously.\n\nBut this message is to give a huge shoutout to this LWMR Discord. Everything I'm learning here about mixing, mastering, different approaches to work, active listening, where to focus, etc\u2014 it's all contributed immensely. I want to thank each and every one of you who's shared even the tiniest piece of advice or insight. This place is a treasure of great info, and it's genuinely helping me grow, not just professionally but personally too. I truly feel it's making a profoundly positive impact on my work!",

It\u2019s not always fast or easy but it\u2019s always unique whether you like it or not. He\u2019s been a huge inspiration to me and a constant reminder that we are making art not products.

Not \"download my e-book\" guys. This space is a rare resource and a gift in the world we work in, and it's not always going to confirm your opinion. I don't post every day because I don't always have something to say or to add value, but I do gain a beautiful new perspective on a subject from reading through here at least a few times a week that I wouldn't have had the thought of without this space.\n\nIf you're gonna go after this job for real, you're gonna have the craziest shit thrown at you from clients, collaborators, peers and heroes that you've ever heard. \n\nYour feelings will not be protected when you operate in this industry at a professional level. \n\nSo, learning to take it on the chin and ask \"what is there to learn here?\" in a moment you're challenged is what will make you grow and be resilient. \n\nI just re-printed a stem an hour ago for a background vocal I fucked up \"fixing\" the timing of in the chorus. The client was incredibly direct and insensitive of my feelings about it, and if I hit them back to argue what was \"technically correct\" based on the grid and subdivisions I was looking at, and why I was right, they wouldn't care. They wanted it different, so I saw it through their lens of how they wrote the part and corrected it to deliver for the artist. And you know what? That result was better than my feeling of what was \"technically correct.\" They were right. A beautiful reminder to serve the song rather than to check the box. \n\nThe older I get the more I equally trust my taste and remain open to learning something based on new information. Adopting that mindset will only serve you in the process of experimentation of self and collaboration with others.",

A lot of our work happens in the shadows and often goes unappreciated, but I sleep better at night knowing you guys are also out there -- in the weeds -- trying to set higher standards for both the creation and the consumption of music across the genres. Not everyone will get it and I think that's OK.

It lets you squeeze so much saturation out of a signal without driving things too hard. \n\nFirst, you drive your signal to the point where the loudest part starts to break up, then you use the de-emphasis to subtract that frequency from the saturation circuit and then you push the gain up even harder until you're on the edge of breakup again. Wash, rinse, repeat. \n\nWhat you end up with is a signal that's evenly saturated across the entire frequency range instead of only having the loudest parts treated, because they're all hitting the saturation at roughly the same level. This thing is amazing. It's the sound that I've been searching for for soooo long.",

    "content": "I\u2019ll add one thing to this conversation. Some of my favorite mixers and producers are not the most technically knowledgeable people. They don\u2019t necessarily understand what\u2019s going on under the hood. They do certainly know when something is working or not. I\u2019m not knocking understanding how all the tools we use work but rather  I\u2019m saying it not essential to making great art.  There is an interesting trend here and in audio education in general of what are the do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s are. Example: only process groups and less mix  buss. Multi bands are a no go. Soothe 2 sucks.  Yes everything has a trade off and might not be the right tool but some of my favorite mixes have used these tools and some haven\u2019t.  My two cents are to try things out and find out for yourself what works for you, what\u2019s working for that particular song. If you are really Struggling to make something work it might be worth asking around why, and you might find a technical explanation of why, but It also might be more educational to experiment then dialoging about why you should or shouldn\u2019t do something.

I learned very early to not get so emotionally attached to my work because there was very often ample headroom to keep pushing the ideas further and ultimately get the work to a more realized and better state. It has been my experience having worked in a creative field beyond music and painting for over 25 years, that the people who are most successful, welcome and embrace critique and don\u2019t get sent down an unproductive path when their ideas are challenged. It can be very difficult to hear that what you thought was a good idea, might not actually be. As creative folk, we have to find ways to separate how our sensitive nature absolutely helps us and at times, gets in our way. We needn\u2019t be so precious about things, especially if holding on holds us back. \n\nI\u2019ve found being very direct without beating around the bush is a way more effective means of communicating and leads to better places more quickly. It is a skill to learn to operate alongside people who won \u2019t sugarcoat their feedback in pursuit of better outcomes. The earlier one can learn how to thrive within that framework, I think the better off you will be.",

It's more that everyone is chopping, clip gaining, and RXing to an evenness that softens and linearizes performances. \n\nThese tools work beautifully when shitty mic technique makes things boomy, or there's a few weird ss's on the pre-hyped TLM mic through the focusrite pre.\n\nBut it sounds like most people who learn the tools are overusing them like crazy. \n\nI'm trying these days to get off the details and try as much macro-mixing as possible. When I let performances breathe in their imperfections, I find that I'm drawn in more as a listener.\n\n\"Music is the space between the notes\". \n-Claude Debussy\n\n\"Music is the space between RX moves.\" \n-Ruair\u00ed (probably)",

I think all mixers inherently have a taste and vibe that they employ in their mixes even if they don\u2019t realize it, and they get hired because of it, but you have to be able to combine your taste with being being that \u201cfinisher\u201d when the song calls for it. Learn when to just push a great rough mix to the finish line and leave the good things alone, but when you\u2019re given dryer tracks be able to mix with a heavier hand and not overdo it (or underdo it)\n\nBut I\u2019ve also learned that the mixers these days who can \u201cfinish\u201d really really well, who can take a 95% awesome rough mix and push it the extra 5% are the great mixers of the modern day, to me at least. That 5% is so much harder than people realize it is, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to learn and study how to do more than anything as a mixer. It can seem like mixers who are given great productions have it easy and just do a couple things and call it good, but it can be so tough to know how to improve an already great mix.",

The artist and I met and listened to some of the tunes and we chatted about sonic direction. Upon my first listen I had some specific ideas of where to go with the mixes, in particular with the vocal sounds.  On the first day of mixing I still felt the same way about notes I had made. After about a couple hours of mixing I found myself taking a left turn from the original direction I had in mind and I stopped and chatted with the artist and I felt the music was taking me elsewhere and was surprised where we ended up.  Luckily the artist was chill and also felt the same way and we were psyched where we ended up.  This was a reminder to myself that the music usually tells you what works and what doesn\u2019t and just because you have an idea doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what the track wants. This is what I do love about in person mixing, we all have ideas and you don\u2019t know if they are any good until you try them.",

I did a number on the drums but just couldn't get the low end to sync between the two. I ended up sending the mono bass to two mis-matched outboard compressors. They're totally un-linked and I just matched them by ear and wow... sounds so fucking good. Each one is grabbing and doing it's thing and it's *mostly* adding up to mono but gives real life when things momentarily lean left or right. Reminds me of a drum setup photo today where some of the mics were mis-matched and that's just honest-to-god so OK most of the time.",

Any clown (not referring to you) can find out from Colt Copernicus on YouTube how to widen their mix\u2026 the thing to me that sets the pros apart is knowing if it should be done. \n\nRuairi talks a lot about mastering engineers giving the artist and label confidence that the record is DONE, cause it\u2019s gone through his hands. It\u2019s not just that Ruairi has great ears, he knows what those ears are supposed to be listening for. (I remember this idea crystallized a bit for me when Noah mentioned when we did a song together I was looking to achieve things in the vocal that he hadn\u2019t even considered yet, rather than us just agreeing if it needs 5k). I send songs to Cian not because I want to make sure it still holds up on his garbage speakers, but because I want his input on whether we were right to have the vocals out front or the drums destroyed or whatever. And I feel like he has the confidence to (gently) suggest that maybe we missed the forest for the trees in 3 months of production and THIS keyboard line should be the thing that carries the chorus.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the wider conversation of what are we trying to bring to the table? Do we want to just do whatever we can to have our name on as many things as possible, or do we want to be the kind of artist/producer/mixer whose involvement actually matters, even if that j evolvement is \u201cyeah, you got it mostly right, just bumped up 60hz a bit not because I\u2019m lazy but because I genuinely think the rough works\u201d",
