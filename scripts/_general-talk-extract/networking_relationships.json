Just wanted to say how much I appreciate this community and attest to the quality of conversation here.\n\nI put in my resignation notice at the day job today, and will be transitioning to music full-time in May. I genuinely don\u2019t believe I could have done it without this place. You all challenge me in the best ways, and have helped me grow tremendously as a person and a professional.\n\nI still don\u2019t have it all sorted out, and I\u2019m still fervently pursuing mentorship in any form I can find, but for now the work is paying the bills; something I thought I\u2019d never be able to say.\n\nThank you all for being generous with your hard-earned wisdom. It really does make a difference.\n\n(Sorry, got a bit sappy there \ud83d\ude05)",

    "content": "I've had certain partners that are easier to deal with than others with this kind of thing for sure, and being with someone who actually understands these things really helps, but at the end of the day no one wants to be with someone who's grinding 100% of the time. There's more to life than that, and whats the point of being in a relationship if you never see the other person. I also get the working in music/freelance lifestyle, and sometimes its hard to even want to do fun things outside of it when you're so focused on this thing that really excites you that also is your livelyhood.\n\nIts such a hard thing to get right and in my experience with certain partners, its been an ongoing arguement, even in the past when i've had salary jobs and a very predictable schedule. So i'm not sure it goes away by making your life more regimented. I think the only answer here is being super open and radically honest about everything. \n\nIn my experience, letting your partner know when you've been asked to do something before you've agreed to it, makes them feel like they're a part of the thought process behind the work and less like they're just observing you living your life from the outside. Even if you were always gonna say yes to it anyway, at least they feel like they have some control and are on the same team as you. IME you just gotta go out of your way to make them feel like they're doing it all with you. They feel closer to you in a situation where they could just as easily feel like they're being pushed away. I'm not sure what way you've went about it, thats just my experience. If you're living with your partner you kinda have to see yourselves as the same person working toward the same thing, as opposed to two individuals with their own lives.\n\nAlso going out of your way to be spontaneous and do something fun and/or stupid like you're teenagers when things arent as busy goes a long way when things are.",

    "content": "Ok Tl;dr- where you are matters as much as who you are. \n\nI\u2019m also from a small town, moved to LA trying to get famous and got my ass handed to me by artists who were better looking & more talented and yet were still struggling to be seen. But I kept at it because I\u2019m tenacious, (read: delusional, as all artists must be.)\n\nI was able to work *for* some of those artists cause I had a diverse skillset, and I was full time music after about 4 years, by the time I was 26. Doing gigs at hotels and playing guitar or recording for other people, teaching guitar, leading music at churches, all the while pouring evening last ounce of money & energy into my artist career, until my last real artist project broke up the week we were supposed to sign our first record deal. I was 36. \n\nThat\u2019s when I moved to Nashville and really gave myself over to music directing and producing and writing for other artists. I did it as a consolation while I regrouped to find my next thing, but for some reason, when I made the move all the sudden my whole career made sense to me. \n\nAs it turns out, my real joy comes not from the sound of my own voice, but from helping others find theirs. When I acquiesced to that very real, very culturally counterintuitive calling, I thrived. \n\nAll the sudden I was playing music with and for a bunch of my heroes, and all my friends who were artists starting getting famous. And (shocker) I was really glad I wasn\u2019t one of them. \n\nI always thought that my calling was to help people feel less alone in the world, and that the music I made was the vehicle for that calling. In the end, it turns out it was the relationships i built through music that were the real vehicle.  \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out who I was, and the cities I was in played a huge role in that story. Nashville built its whole industry on people who want to *help* artists, not just *be* artists. \n\nI miss LA every day but I\u2019m in the right place. So, my friend, where is the right place for you?",

No matter how shitty my delivery or communication, they approach things with a smile and a sense of humor. I\u2019ve literally never heard either of them complain. I thought commiserating about shitty aspects of a gig was a part of professionalism, but they have me rethinking things. \n\nIn my own projects, when I approach clients with patience and curiosity, I find that not only are they happier faster, I\u2019m happier the whole time. It\u2019s SO MUCH EASIER to say \u201clet\u2019s try it\u201d than to say \u201chere\u2019s why that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d I find I learn a lot that way too. \n\nIn any case, going back in to fix or add only bugs me when I think I\u2019m supposed to be done. If I can stay open, then opening a session feels a lot easier. \n\nSo I guess my advice is: you might have fewer problem clients if you try to remember they\u2019re not problems to solve, they\u2019re people to serve.",

But it took years of patiently learning the ropes at the highest level to be trusted by the folks in the highest circles. I look back upon that now and I\u2019m still amazed that I was paid to do that. It was essentially like a paid college degree in making records.\n\nSo now when I go into studios with a big client, I see the assistant through those eyes. I\u2019m kind but communicative. If they can hang in the back and figure out how I work, anticipate breaks \u2014 get the menu book ready \u2014 know that we\u2019re going to change gears \u2014 start setting up for that \u2014 then they get looped in. They get my running commentary on what techniques I\u2019m doing. They get the inside baseball\u2026 \u201cI wish they fired this fucking drummer\u201d. \n\nI agree with Ruairi that this type of coming up through the ranks is a loss for up and comers. It was tried and true way to make people understand the ins and outs of studio technique, etiquette, professionalism. I\u2019m glad I got to ride one of the last waves of it. I wouldn\u2019t be here making records at this level if it weren\u2019t for the opportunities I had at the bottom levels of the industry.",

If what you're doing is not having the desired outcome, then it demands a reexamination of what you're doing or what outcome you're aiming for. For some, that can be catastrophic because the worldview they've built, all hinges on everything lining up perfectly. In reality, that is a moonshot mostly out of their control and they need to reset expectations about timing and outcomes. If this person hasn't shored up the fundamental needs of their family or relationship or finances, then it stands to reason they aren't grounded in their reality and for me, would call into question whether they actually have put in their best efforts (best efforts to me would include integrating these factors into my equation and making sure my pursuits aren't the source of added strife for myself or others).",

    "content": "Story time. Last night me and my gf saw Janelle Mon\u00e1e on her age of pleasure tour at the Ryman here in Nashville. While she was making her entrance on stage something weird happened to the sound. Loud pop, clicking, and then no signal, but seemed like the in-ears / on stage monitoring were still working. Her and the band played through the entire first song while everyone in the audience was just looking around confused. Many heads turning to the sound board. Eventually the crowd started a 'we can't hear you' chant and Janelle and the band realized what was going on. They all calmly walked off stage. Took maybe ten minutes for it all to get sorted with the sound. Then Janelle and her band proceeded to come back out redo the entire intro / first song and give maybe the greatest live performance I've ever witnessed. The show ended with a double encore. It felt like such an amazing example of class and professionalism. I got the sense that she decided, after walking off the stage the first time, that not a single person in the audience will remember this show being anything but amazing and it was. Truly undeniable. If anyone here has a chance to catch any of the remaining shows on her tour, I could not recommend it enough. \ud83e\udd18",

Cutting edge in creative pursuits, but classics in my personal taste. Specialist in my mode of expression, and generalist in my interests.\n\nThe more I subdivide and examine the question the more I find exceptions to everything. I am steeped in knowledge, but I seek wisdom above most things, which some philosophies would consider contradictory.\n\nThis Anais Nin quote comes to mind:\n\n> \"We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.

We are made of layers, cells, constellations.\"\n\nI think people are extremely lopsided and unbalanced when you start to drill down into their psyches, and that's wonderful! \n\nFor the sake of refining this question and narrowing the scope, should we confine these three axis to only record making?

    "content": "This completely resonates with me. The business of music doesn\u2019t sit as well with me as the business of construction. There\u2019s a camaraderie and kinship in physical labour on construction projects, and an embodied intelligence in that world that offsets the subjective and (for me) atomised work of hours alone mixing.\n\nWhen I\u2019m doing construction work, I\u2019m also free to think objectively and from a distance about my audio engineering work.\n\nMost of all, something changes for me when I\u2019m being paid for musical \u201cwork\u201d that I\u2019m not entirely happy with. I\u2019ve discussed this privately with a few folks here, and it seems the relationship between music and its commodification is problematic for more than a few of us. Simply put, it\u2019s sometimes less enjoyable \u2014 though equally amazing \u2014 being paid for a passion.\n\nI couldn\u2019t recommend a construction or skilled trade career enough. It\u2019s incredibly flexible and offers a tonic to music careers: you know you can walk onto a site tomorrow and get paid quickly and well. It\u2019s always going to be around, and in my case, the certifications allow me to consider migrating to most economies globally as a skilled worker.\n\nConstruction allows me to be my own patron for my musical endeavours, and that feels really good.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a bigger debate here about how working in the upper echelons of the music industry feels long term \u2014 challenges, payoffs, economics, job security, retirement, healthcare, family life versus work life, and a world where socialising is networking.\n\nConstruction is a simpler engagement: competency, find a solution, do the work, go home.\n\nI came across @cian riordan discussing becoming a fireman on Conversations, and much of what you said, Cian, is exactly what I get from construction.\n\nI love how for you, though \u2014 instead of the firehouse bell calling, it was multiple Grammys!",

The time commitment in and out of the classroom between 6 classes makes it almost impossible for me to be able to adhere to anyone else\u2019s schedules, whether that be as a freelancer or assistant. I like to think a smart trusted friend would agree but I\u2019d also wanna know if there\u2019s anything else they\u2019re seeing. \n\nI wanna use my time in school to give back this year. Even though I can\u2019t do music full time I\u2019ve been freelancing. While I wanna scale up after school, a lot of the people I\u2019ve worked with are coming back now because they feel they can\u2019t go to another engineer where we\u2019re at and \nget the same quality/experience they\u2019re getting from me, and they can\u2019t afford to go to bigger studios/engineers either. I\u2019ve also had a lot of people make comments about how much they like my rooms vs other studios they\u2019ve worked in. \n\nSo while I\u2019m in school I wanna offer my rooms to other people who are serious about their music so they can take their stuff to a level they\u2019re happy with and is pro sounding enough. It really bums me out when I see people in the local scene who are super good, passionate, and hardworking when it comes to creating their music met with roadblocks caused by bad rooms, poor engineering, and economics. \n\nIf anyone wants to chime in with ideas, I\u2019m thinking of offering a free session to students at my university to come record with me/just letting friends I trust into my spaces to use while I\u2019m in class or whatever",

To use your analogy, dating a new girl feels different than a year in, vs. being married, vs. having a family. It's absolutely normal for the type of love you have for music to evolve over time and repetition.\n\nI kind of doubt that earning money from music is the root cause of your feelings. But it might be affecting how you encounter music. If it's all feeling too ordinary, then break the ordinary. Go listen to live music that's far away from anything you touch. Pick up an instrument you don't know how to play and get in a room with some friends and enjoy being bad, but exploring music like a child. \n\nThe \"quitting\" thing often feels like something often born out of rough working experiences, or perhaps just too mundane. Bills have to get paid (burgers gotta get flipped) but perhaps you can balance those gigs with things that challenge and excite you, even if they're not particularly lucrative. \n\ntl;dr I think we all go through phases of questioning if the career is worth it, if not questioning our relationship with music itself, but in my experience, almost everyone comes out the other side after a bit of a mental reset.",

We'd been having a reoccurring friction in our relationship where she thought that I wasn't taking things seriously enough. Not everything, mind you, but there were certain scenarios where my humor was dismaying to her.\n\nEventually, what we discovered by accident one evening when exploring our personal values was that we both had very different understandings about the role and purpose of humor.\n\nTo me humor is a playground for creativity, trying things out, and testing ideas. It's play. To her, humor was something that she had come to know as a defense mechanism for defusing tense situations. She was very explicit about that.\n\nAs a result of these unvoiced beliefs there were moments where I was being playful and she would interpret it as me changing the subject or downplaying something. She thought I was being defensive. This difference in beliefs was hidden to both of us and it was leading us into frustration because we thought we had the same understanding of what something was.\n\nI'm rambling a bit at this point, but It's always a huge relief when you manage to uncover the unspoken assumptions that you or another person are holding.",

Find the artist who is hungry for success and is working every day on their craft. Because they are in the same spot as you, they are looking for the engineer who will elevate their career and their music. If you have spent the time honing your craft they will see that and you will have a much greater chance of creating a strong relationship and elevating each other.",

I'm not in the stratosphere in terms of accreditation, but I'm comfortably making a healthy living, am married, have a child, and own a house. If I relied on big breaks, I'd be absolutely nowhere. 99% of my success has come from rubbing shoulders with the right people and finding opportunity that way. A night out drinking with friends leads to meeting other people who you stay in touch with. Pretty soon they'll need help with something and then off you go, that leads to the next. 75% of what I work on is smaller potatoes... most of it will never get heard, but it pays most of my salary. And the 25% of work I have that makes it through the filters has all come through connections I've made through smaller gigs. Networking is really key. And if you're a social person, it's even better as it'll help offset the time spent alone in a soundproof room, pulling your hair out over a stupid kick drum sound.",

Making a career in the music industry is what engineers would call a \"wicked\" problem. It's not something that has a repeatable solution, and what works for someone rarely works the same way for the next person.\n\nThat said, I see that you\u2019re from Boston. I lived there for seven years, and the talent pool in that city is tremendous. I think if you found yourself back home in Boston it would be a worthwhile investment to integrate yourself into the scene of young musicians that are centered around the schools in the Back Bay like Berklee, NEC, and Boston Conservatory. There are some immensely talented, diverse, and creative people from all around the world based at those institutions and they all exist within 8 blocks of each other. It\u2019s rare to have such a concentration of driven musicians all mingling amongst each other. This is a massive resource that you can tap into. They're *all* trying to make something great and explore what's possible.\n\nIt's a unique opportunity to discover collaborators, build relationships, earn experience in your craft, and build strong connections for the future as you grow alongside these people. On top of that, Boston has numerous recording studios where you can intern and assist. There\u2019s a lot of experience to be gained working in a studio that simply won\u2019t be taught to you in a recording program. Supplement that practical experience with hard work, and some book learning and you can do very well for yourself.\n\nThere\u2019s more that I\u2019m not touching-on, but I think if you ended up back in Boston it not be as much as a trade-off as you may think.",

Which option is best I\u2019d say depends on your relationship with them, how much of a lead you want to take creatively, how confident you are in making the right choices for this song, etc. etc.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @cian riordan might have better advise for these situations!",

Silly name, but a stimulating read.\n\nIn the article David describes his epiphany about how popular flavor profiles in recipes re-occur across cultural boundaries. How a Chinese spicy pork sausage and rice cake has the same fundamental flavor profile as an Italian ceci e pepe and they share underlying structures that are expressed differently in their respective cultural incarnations. In math this would be called an isomorphism.\n\nWell this immediately rang to true to me because I'd observed the same thing in music. I thought about this article for a year. Finally I saw that they were giving a talk in a hotel showroom with 500 people in attendance and made it a point to attend.\n\nWhen the open mic was passed around I asked my prepared question, expressing my admiration for their insight and how it was applicable to other domains beyond food. I asked them if they'd had any additional insights on this phenomena since publishing the article.\n\nThey both looked to each other, didn't say a word, and then proceeded to ask for the next question \ud83d\ude15.\n\nTo this day I have no idea what happened.",

The problem I was trying to solve was making my working drive available to me for when I\u2019m away from my studio so I can continue to be responsive to clients at all times. \n\nTailscale allows you to create a secure, private VPN without having to have a networking PHD and compromising your network. Basically install the client on a device, 2-factor auth into the client and any other client you have installed on any device signed in with those same credentials are available to you as if you\u2019re on the same local network, even if you\u2019re on another network anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s an actual game changer.\n\nFor a variety of reasons including keeping my mastering rig lean and clean and because the rig is not always on because I don\u2019t want to run my HVAC 24/7, I sync a clone of my working drive from my mastering rig to a drive attached to an always-on Mac in my home network that has the Tailscale client authenticated. I\u2019ve got screen share enabled on that Mac and now from any other device, I can sign into it and grab whatever I need from that clone drive. You can install the client on virtually any device including NAS\u2019s and mobile phones so it opens up whole new avenues in how to think about availability of your data, traveling, 3rd party cloud vs. rolling your own, etc. Tons of possibilities. Really big fan. Love the future.\n\nhttps://tailscale.com/",

I always feel like \"dude it's not your song, start your artist project if you want!\"",

You have to be able to explain to yourself and to others why it has to cost so much. You're a business owner and you have to account for A) overhead (studio, gear, business expenses) B) a liveable wage to earn C) you need money to make enough profit to put some in the bank for long-term goals and D) You are providing a service that doesn't always have a clear-cut point of completion. It will take as long as it needs to and sometimes your clients will come back weeks or months later and ask for something more. You need to budget for all of that.",

Just because you have a deal with $1500 now versus $4000 in a year doesn\u2019t mean that you should take $1500 now, unless you need that kind of capital). To apply that logic to situations beyond the time value of money isn\u2019t the whole picture: that law of economics only compares value, it doesn\u2019t tell us that concentrating labor for short term gains yields the best possible business model. By that logic, there is an argument that everyone\u2019s best business decision is to forego longterm relationship building, knowledge acquisition (which is like R&D for producers), and strictly focus on maximizing immediate sales (which could look like everyone hopping on beatstars, fiverr, and enginears) which would diminish resources like this very discord, and probably a lot of reputations too!",

What i would worry about is connecting your vocal chords to your ears and brain. technique and breathing isn't something to worry about just yet. A teacher/mentor can be great for guidance. But they can be expensive. A few lessons could def put you in a direction. I would start with ear training learning to hear melodies. Usually when people are unable to hit a note it has less to do with technique and more to do with their ability to decern pitch and notes. \n\nStarting out is always tough, but start by singing everyday, sing along to your favourite songs. also try and pull up a piano and press a key and then sing the note, then press another key and sing that note, this will teach you to actively target notes with your voice/ears. Learn to sing simple songs on your own without any backing tracks or music. Nursery rhymes are great, they are simple and a lot of people have them internalised. When you get some more confidance, try and have a static chord or note, and sing different notes on top of it and see how the different notes feel / sound and really internalise that.",

I have two visual meters while I mix... a janky old Goldline RTA analyzer and a TC Electronics Clarity. The RTA is useful for quick visual cues of kick to snare balance, how subby something really is, or when I'm working out phase relationships between drum mics... I can quickly glance to help aid with decision making. It's not necessary for me to mix, but I've had it for 15 years and it helps me make certain technical decisions quicker. The Clarity is very useful for the loudness radar. I basically set a guide LUFS (in my case, I'm usually shooting for -9) and you get a great visual representation of where you're at over the course of the song. Its especially useful to avoid fader creep... where I might nail the dynamics and loudness in the earlier parts of the song, but might overlook the last chorus being significantly louder, and in some cases, more squashed than it needs to be. I'm also an LCR panning guy, and it has a 'balance-o-meter' feature that has a cool weighted algorithm for determining if your mix is leaning left or right.",

(Lol.)\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to live in nyc my entire adult life and never have\u2014it\u2019s never made sense to do it career-wise and probably never really will. But every time I\u2019m there I feel totally at home and happy and excited in a way I don\u2019t anywhere else. I spent a summer there several years ago and always linger as long as I can whenever I can, have close friends there (not in music), end up there usually a couple times a year and relish it every time. I feel like I know it as well as is possible for never having been a resident.\n\nI know the music biz there is pretty much defunct (at least compared to LA), and I really *really* don\u2019t want to repeat the emotional and financial ruin that I experienced moving to LA and restarting everything 6 yrs ago\u2026 but from a non-career perspective it\u2019s where I want to be.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m in it to fucking win it in LA for my career\u2014though with an eye for sure on getting to a point where I can relatively comfortably make that move.\n\nAny wisdom/experience on making a mid-career move like this from folks here? I\u2019m 35 yrs old, some decent credits but not major traction yet, in a basically married but not actually married relationship with a school principal who is into the idea of a move there as well (though our finances are totally separate and I for sure need to earn!), no kids or desire/plan to have kids.\n\nAny benchmarks/goals that might be reasonable to aim for before seriously starting to make moves on this? I\u2019d do it tomorrow if I could, but would also stay in LA for 5+ more years no prob to set things up properly. Even open to things like a podcast (/radio?/other audio prod) gig to help smooth the transition if that\u2019s reasonable to find and lucrative enough\u2014but what I\u2019m really looking for is how to think of this as a full time freelance record maker. Or if someone on here secretly is hiring for staff gigs at Electric Lady, plz lmk \ud83d\ude09",

Paradox of climbing up to the highest level\nCould Michael Jordan have become Michael Jordan if it wasn\u2019t for the feeling of someone chasing behind him to become one of the greatest of all time? There is only one Michael Jordan, and can anyone else be that one and only without going through what he has put himself through? \n\n2. Acceptance vs Dissatisfaction\nI think the dilemma here is between satisfaction and acceptance vs beating. I don\u2019t think one or the other is necessarily the answer, but I think a good place to be is finding acceptance in where I am right now while still beating on myself to keep on improving to the highest level I could be. \n\n3. Potential\nThis is a crazy concept to me. Who is anyone to evaluate someone\u2019s ceiling of improvement? Spider defined the meaning of \u2018potential\u2019 perfectly in my opinion. Not his exact works but; one\u2019s capable/willing range of adaptation. Did the professor in Whiplash really expand his students\u2019 potential in this sense? \n\n4. Abusive Internal voice \nI love how he saw the professor as our internal voice. And it made perfect sense to why I was so obsessed with this movie and the character. He was myself to me all along. I went back and forth over and over on whether this relationship was worth it to either of them. I think perhaps limited to this particular two people, because they had common goals/interests and made it happen. \n\n5. Joy?\nI feel that this is the most simple and complex out of all things here. Can anyone NOT experience any frustration while trying to get better at something? If the answer is no, is there a way to better manage the frustration? \n\nPursuit vs Result, our brain works the most consistently when we look towards pursuit. Result feels good but not for long, but what if the result meant more than just the goal being achieved? What if the \u201cresult\u201d portion leads to another pursuit after another?",

I\u2019ve had many wins, but going a long period without financial wins has made me question the judgement I have when navigating everything.\n\n\u201cWinning\u201d to me is a culmination of things that can be summed up as living authentically while positively contributing to the world and lives of others. It helps fight of the tendrils of negativity I feel coming from so many angles of the outside world, especially in the last decade.\n\nI don\u2019t exactly know what I\u2019m asking. Or want. I\u2019m looking to process these feelings and synthesize them into a new level of awareness as I move forward with what I\u2019ve learned being integrated into my subconscious.\n\nSometimes being around others, or hearing their experiences and takes, helps me get angles of things in a way that I can piece together for a rough draft of what will become the lesson that I carry with me moving forward, regarding this topic at this time.",
