    "content": "God I love this discord. \nTo me 90% of the reason big producers are paying many thousands a day to be in a studio the past 15-20 years is to just not have to worry about shit. Anyone can make a record at home these days; part of being in an \u201cactual\u201d studio is the cocoon of creativity. If the assistant takes more than a couple of minutes to patch anything in, bring up the piano, or recommend the best Thai place in town, they\u2019re blowing it. I had an assistant once at this place famous for making cookies on site, bring me my normal plate of cookies I always ask for and while I was comping I ate half of one, put it back on the plate, and continued working. He didn\u2019t say a word, got up, grabbed the plate, and disappeared for a few minutes and came back. \u201cHey man, I know you normally house the entire plate of cookies so when you put that one back I checked with the kitchen and last week I guess they changed the cookie recipe, and they\u2019re gonna make em like they used to for you.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I asked for that dude every session after, less for the cookies but more for the insane attention to detail and telepathy. One of max\u2019s engineers started as a Conway assistant, and as good of an engineer as he was he also prepped the best Hookahs and was just a great hang. Max ended up hiring him for his own studio. We\u2019re in a people business, try to be attentive and a good person to have around, for all the reasons that go beyond knowing how to set an attack on an 1176. \n\nThe flip side is, if you\u2019re booking a studio as a producer, the assistants are what really make the studio run. Treat them well. Know their names. Give them credit. No assistant on any session I ever did paid for their own meal, they got what the artist got.  They most of the time got engineer credits. Help them along. As with all things, mutual respect goes a long way.",

Having only experienced studio work as a cottage industry up to that point, PP opened my eyes to avenues I could pursue that I wouldn\u2019t have known even existed otherwise (recording engineer is different to mixing engineer is different to producer is different to songwriter??!). It all seems very rudimentary now, but I was starting from literally nothing in a place with few (if any?) visible role models.\n\nI learned so much from it on a technical level - from basic stuff like what a Pultec is and how people use it (connecting the dots between my cracked Waves bundle - Puigtec and who tf JJP was), what \u201ca vocal chain\u201d might look like and the purpose of each stage\u2026\n\nTrue, the interviews did become unbearable, but there was a golden era between eps around 30-90 at a time when outside of working in the studio world, there weren\u2019t many other sources of good information from people who were really doing it.\n\nHuge appreciation for Dave, and I hope he and his family get the support they need.",

He notes that it\u2019s particularly dangerous if an intelligent person gives you the requirements, as you may not question the requirements enough. \u201cEveryone\u2019s wrong.

Musk noted that the bias tends to be very strongly toward \u201clet\u2019s add this part or process step in case we need it.\u201d Additionally, each required part and process must come from a name, not a department, as a department cannot be asked why a requirement exists, but a person can.\n\n**3) Simplify and optimize the design.** This is step three as the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist.\n\n**4) Accelerate cycle time.** Musk states \u201cyou\u2019re moving too slowly, go faster! But don\u2019t go faster until you\u2019ve worked on the other three things first.\u201d\n\n**5) Automate.** An important part of this is to remove in-process testing after the problems have been diagnosed; if a product is reaching the end of a production line with a high acceptance rate, there is no need for in-process testing.",

Many people working in audio have never even seen such a machine. They are complicated - there are techs who work on consoles who won\u2019t touch cutting lathes. IMO the best lathes were made by Neumann in the 70s/early 80s, and that was a long time ago. You have a TON of electronics and mechanics that need to be refurbished / restored to get the lathe to make some great cuts. Some engineers are cutting on some nicely restored systems and some are using some OLD stuff which should have been pulled for maintenance decades ago. Imagine if 50% of the records today were mastered on 50 year old loudspeakers with blown drivers and mismatched crossovers. We might notice.",

    "content": "Love this discussion. All great points \u2014 my gut says there is a distinction between the producer/engineer role here and the artist. The learn grammar, be able to adjust and deliver on a vision/etc all lend themselves to being amazing technically and doing the reps to have those skills. Very useful on the service side\n\nBut some artists just have it like that. It\u2019s irrelevant, they just crush stuff and have a vision. Pure talent. And probably the rarest ones have both sides and are aware of it. Then you\u2019re truly dangerous\n\nHave seen this with some football guys I\u2019ve played with \u2014 I was one of the ones who studied the game deeply and could improve. But other guys showed up on day one, knew absolutely nothing but could just ball. Their knowledge of the game didn\u2019t even matter, they could just ball on instinct. Of course they worked hard, but there was a different level of talent there. And look at them now, cashing checks in the NFL",

    "content": "I went to help a fellow engineer buddy record some drums today at his studio, and it made me think of something Jon Castelli said on the Conversations or LWMR podcast - he challenged the idea of being out of your comfort zone to grow, and look at the Benefits of the comfort zone.\n\nMy buddy is a great engineer and great drummer in a great and, so all great things. But his setup was just incredibly different than mine; he uses Studio One, I use pro tools (he\u2019s also used to Pro tools and recently bailed on it). He\u2019s using a combo of Antelope Discrete 8 and an Audient ASP880 and some good outboard pres (Vintech and Summit audio). His monitoring killed me, some small dynaudios which sounded okay and some ProAc\u2019s. He had some decent mics. I brought my 8 Channels of UTA and a bunch of mics and was there just to put our heads together, and I was going mostly press record so he could drum for his bands record.\n\nAnyway, we spent about 4+ hours trouble shooting Studio One, his computer, and the interfaces -eventually finding out one of his AD/DA channels was so messed up it sounded like a ribbon mic when it was a condenser. A lot of his mic stands and cables were really junky - he didn\u2019t have enough of the basics on his own.\n\nSo many things were just not working as I would expect - my UTA preamps were set at much lower gains than I do at my studio because of his gear. I\u2019m basically ear-blind because of the monitoring, even with headphones, and I\u2019m working in Studio One so I can barely focus on the sound. And he used a normal Apple mouse, I use a trackball. \n\nIm trying not to complain, but it just blew my mind how much of an uphill battle recording can be just because of simple things being so taxing. We spent about an hour of the 6 hours I was there tracking one song. The rest was setup. It made me realize why we put so much work into making our process simple and getting gear that is effective and reliable.",

HE knew that's how he could rock out the most and get the best vocal.\n\neric valentine gave Adam from Taking Back Sunday a neumann hand held condenser on a long cable so he could move around the room and perform.\n\ni just figured out how to edit them after the fact. they weren't as clean as standing in front of a U47 with a pop screen. but they sounded fucking awesome",

I went into UK Funky and we were all listening to Ferrer and Chandler .....Quentin Harris was another great dj with some great tracks at that time .....we had a club in London called the east village which was explicitly mimicking the Manhattan east village vibe at the time and Quentin Harris held a night there monthly I\u2019d go down to .\n\nV v cool. \n\nHe and Dennis personified the concept of using space and silence in a production imho .\n\nCheck Dennis ferrer - touched the sky . This tune was huge here . Wonderful house production \n\nAnd Quentin Harris remix of Justin timber lake \u201cwhat goes around \u201c ....a beguiling steady building deep groove .\n\nThe opening  section to sonny fodera and MK,s  \u201casking \u201c (out now ) reminded me of proper house and garage from the late 90s / early 00,s like Rui da silva touch me and trippin by gold trix feat Andrea brown \n\n.....and it had me thinking about doing a few house and garage tracks again myself. The hip hop culture imho has become stagnant and toxic at the mo imho and I don\u2019t perceive much  appreciation for artistry as it stands.....feel myself drifting off into other genres ...\n\nMaybe time to swap the 808 back to the 909",

    "content": "Hey all, I was wondering what people have done when travelling/flying with microphones before\u2026 can you put them in your checked luggage or do you need to have them in your carry on? I saw something online that said you need \u2018proof\u2019 that they are microphones ie. documentation of some sort an thus it\u2019s wise to put them in your carry on. FYI, I\u2019m travelling with a USB mic and a SM58. \nThanks in advance and happy Easter to those who celebrate it!! \ud83e\udd70",
