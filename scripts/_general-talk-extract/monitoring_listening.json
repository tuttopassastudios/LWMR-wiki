    "content": "Ok Long Post alert, but touches on a few things we harp on around here. \n\nSo my little bro is in town- we made dinner for one of his oldest friends who just moved to town with his wife. He\u2019s a fantastic mandolin player and his wife is a singer/songwriter. \n\nOf course I did the ol\u2019 studio walk through, listening to all the tunes on the ear calibration playlist, then let them play some of their own favs. Of course they\u2019re blown away and have never heard music like this etc. \n\nBut to drive the point home I show them a song @Rollmottle and I turned around in just over 24 hours. \u201cThe reason for the speakers & treatment etc is so we can make decisions quickly blah blah blah.\u201d  I pull up the session and we listen through and they\u2019re loving it- but I\u2019m noticing it doesn\u2019t have the 3D thing that all the other music we\u2019ve been listening to has. \n\nThen I show them the mastered version. An mp3. It\u2019s louder and better sounding and all, until the first BGV stack hits\u2026 then it\u2019s IMMERSIVE. We listened to the whole thing again just to enjoy the magic and notice all the ways the master improved it. So far beyond zapping resonances and making it loud, @Rollmottle made it sound\u2026 important. Made *me* sound like a good mixer. \n\nIt was heavier lifting for him cause I didn\u2019t have the benefit of time for fresh ears or to detail the vocal the way I normally would. Also had the good fortune of having @Ross Fortune on speed dial and on GMT to give it a listen at 5am PST. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re curious, or dubious, I\u2019ll DM files so you can hear what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nTL;DR: monitoring matters, fresh perspective matters. Don\u2019t produce mix *and* master your own shit.",

    "content": "Coincidentally I was exploring a similar idea this morning. I'm on a David Bohm kick and was reading his book 'On Dialogue' and recently finished his 'On Creativity' (would highly recommend both).\n\nIn 'On Dialogue' he gives an example I think can be repurposed here. Imagine a song being presented to us. An external signal. When it reaches us it makes contact with what Bohm calls the \"whole movement of thought\". The thinking and feeling apparatus within us is activated. Thoughts and 'felts' are said to be fundamentally created from memory. Upon contact a 're-presentation' is created where the activity of our thought and feeling reforms the event internally. The 'net presentation' is the fused result. 'Mis-representation' occurs when we mistake the 'net presentation' for the original.\n\nI was thinking on all this and how it might connect to your comment from yesterday, \"I told Jon that I don't think he's ever brought more to an album, but also left less of his fingerprints on it\".\n\nBohm brings up Michael Polanyi's idea of tacit knowledge. This is the always running in the background implicit structure we attend to music from, which makes 're-presentation' possible. This includes nostalgia for records we love, perceptual training, bodily memory, tolerance for brightness, etc... Implied here is that this is something you cannot turn off but can cultivate greater awareness off in disciplined participation with art. Polanyi says we attend from subsidiaries to a focal whole. If you start attending to your own sonic fingerprint as the focal object, the structure may collapse. So perhaps Jon was able to integrate a remarkable tacit contribution while being sensitive to the pre-existing structure and coherence of the whole. Maybe coherence and truth have similar meanings here?\n\nDownstream of the artist's origination maybe 'truth' in record making is deep tacit integration, suspending egoic domination, and sensitivity to the internal structure / coherence of the original whole.",

    "content": "Eventually I caught the hang of things. I started to study the rhythms of the sessions, what order people would file in every morning. I knew the singer liked coffee one way, another guy did something else\u2026 I\u2019d start to have that stuff ready. Instead of chumming it up with the band trying to fend off boredom while Eric was mid task, I stuck around on the couch\u2026 watching patiently. Those were the moments where he would start looping me into what he was doing, explaining his techniques. Before I knew it, I could start anticipating what he would need next. Someone mentions trying some vocals on a thing? I immediately got going on setting up a mic, getting headphones, even starting to dial in a mix on the headphone box. Percussion? Grab the trunk of junk and start laying out potential options. Once I started actually being useful, I\u2019d be given real tasks. \u201cHey, do you think you could try doing a preliminary comp of this vocal?\u201d I had been in the room for all the vocal takes, heard the discussion about approach and vibe, even made the singers coffee the right way\u2026 why not? That evolved into being trusted with recording stuff in the second studio\u2026 we were always running behind, and having me chip away at guitar tracking or re-amping was really useful. Years of this and we were a well oiled machine. I\u2019d get looped into pre-production phone calls and meetings, he would start asking my opinion on things.. drum sounds, microphone choices.",

We had to mix in 5.1 so we had NS10s setup around the console on old tape boxes and had everything up on the console. It was just under 2 hrs of music and we each took an end of the console and were just going at it with Flying Faders... I think thats where I really learned about the power of automation. How much more effective it is just to turn something up or down for a second as opposed to trying to compress/EQ/or saturate your way out of a problem.",

But someone comes in and can say, \u201coh that\u2019s a Patchbay, can you show me how it works\u201d. You can teach those people anything. The desire and hunger to learn on their own and the ability to acquire knowledge for themselves has been a huge divide I\u2019ve noticed in the intern/ college community.  \n\nOne time we were setting up a session and I was explaining to our intern my thoughts about which headphones we\u2019d give to each station. (This pair has better bass, we\u2019ll give them to the bass player. These are open back we\u2019ll give them to the horn section so they can blend better) The very next session without having to mention it, she had placed the same headphones in the same places AND ALSO she then took that info and made a the judgement that we\u2019d give the nicest most comfy pair to the vocalist. That\u2019s what I mean about extrapolation.",

It\u2019s just not. I remember mastering several records with Doug Sax and he would always joke with me saying, \u201cyou know there\u2019s a better medium, right?

Maybe I need to live with them for longer and get used to it.\n\nLast week was the first time that I was able to sit in front of an Atmos setup that was meant for music (aka: not in a movie theater) and really get the full musical experience. In fact, I got to sit in front of *three* different Atmos rigs in three different (treated) rooms that evening and two of them were undoubtedly set up as good as they could have possibly been (One was a PMC showroom and the other built and tuned with their input). While the speakers themselves were impressive and very capable, the actual experience felt pretty disjointed. There was a pronounced feeling of phasi-ness that I didn't like.\n\nIt was great hearing these records on a rig that probably cost $250k, but my big takeaway was that they felt disjointed and odd. Even when sitting in the sweet spot.\n\nPerhaps my opinion will change with more exposure, but I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the time and effort. I will add, though, that half the mixes we heard were up-mixed from old stereo recordings with minimal track counts and only two of them were modern productions.",

    "content": "I went to help a fellow engineer buddy record some drums today at his studio, and it made me think of something Jon Castelli said on the Conversations or LWMR podcast - he challenged the idea of being out of your comfort zone to grow, and look at the Benefits of the comfort zone.\n\nMy buddy is a great engineer and great drummer in a great and, so all great things. But his setup was just incredibly different than mine; he uses Studio One, I use pro tools (he\u2019s also used to Pro tools and recently bailed on it). He\u2019s using a combo of Antelope Discrete 8 and an Audient ASP880 and some good outboard pres (Vintech and Summit audio). His monitoring killed me, some small dynaudios which sounded okay and some ProAc\u2019s. He had some decent mics. I brought my 8 Channels of UTA and a bunch of mics and was there just to put our heads together, and I was going mostly press record so he could drum for his bands record.\n\nAnyway, we spent about 4+ hours trouble shooting Studio One, his computer, and the interfaces -eventually finding out one of his AD/DA channels was so messed up it sounded like a ribbon mic when it was a condenser. A lot of his mic stands and cables were really junky - he didn\u2019t have enough of the basics on his own.\n\nSo many things were just not working as I would expect - my UTA preamps were set at much lower gains than I do at my studio because of his gear. I\u2019m basically ear-blind because of the monitoring, even with headphones, and I\u2019m working in Studio One so I can barely focus on the sound. And he used a normal Apple mouse, I use a trackball. \n\nIm trying not to complain, but it just blew my mind how much of an uphill battle recording can be just because of simple things being so taxing. We spent about an hour of the 6 hours I was there tracking one song. The rest was setup. It made me realize why we put so much work into making our process simple and getting gear that is effective and reliable.",

The gist of it is that we (humans) hear a balance of frequencies differently depending on how loud or how soft the sound is. This affects our ability to accurately judge what the actual balance of a record's frequencies are and make good decisions about a mix. These researchers (Fletcher and Munson) did a lot of research and came up with a chart that shows how our perception of sound changes depending on how loud a sound is. The general takeaway from looking at these results is that we perceive sound as closest to neutral/flat when listening around 80dB and thus it is the least compromised level to listen at.",

If I'm engineering for someone else, I'll defer to them, but these are usually situations where things are even *more* time-sensitive (i.e. we're renting an expensive studio), and the situation is very unlikely to be recreated anyway. I was very lucky to have subbed in for @cian riordan with St. Vincent for a couple months in the early stages of this new record\u2014nothing was documented (unless I grabbed a quick photo to cover my own ass), it was all just trying stuff, and if it worked it worked, if not, move on and forget it! Mixing is another story\u2014in the (increasingly) rare instance when I'm mixing on a console, I'll figure out some way of recalling for that particular project.

A lot of results were still a bit disappointing but some of the tracks that were mixed for atmos sounded pretty good. but still, on headphones- i preferred stereo mixes. It might have to do with the fact that they were louder too. But I would really love to have real atmos experience inside the speakers",

If you\u2019re just starting out, you probably don\u2019t need it. If you\u2019re looking for that last 5-10%, you probably do. Sometimes they don\u2019t need to do anything other than tell you it\u2019s done (which in my opinion is worth it) and sometimes they have to be more heavy handed. What they actually do (if they\u2019re good) will likely be different every time. It\u2019s about getting the song over the line, and whatever it takes to do that.\nYou can get plenty of great mastering engineers for 100 dollars or less.

I blended that with a snare I found in the Linn itself, which was a 12-bit machine, so it sounded pretty edgy to start with.\u201d But the coup de grace for the sound was when Z pumped the processed and blended sample through an Auratone speaker set upside down atop another snare drum, which rattled the metal snares and gave the result some ambience and even more high end. The whole thing was limited slightly and then sent to a track on a roll of Ampex 456 running on a Studer A800 at 15 ips. Only a slight amount of reverb was added to the track later on.",

Bob Marley - Is This Love sounds beautiful to me, but that seems to be an exception (and it still gets at bit of that washy sound). i would imagine these mixes are mixed for a proper Atmos setup, but how many of people listening are really gonna have that? I believe in the Atmos format for headphones for that reason. But i think it would require mixing engineers to mix with headphones in mind if that washy/roomy sound should disappear",

Might be a weird question to ask, but I'm wondering if there's anybody here that's basically gotten rid of their studio in favour of working portably >> laptop + headphones or similar and had better results working that way. The reason I'm asking is because I have a nice studio in central Tokyo, but somehow seem to struggle getting in the flow there as opposed to cafes or other studios. Any nomad producers engineers in the house?",

I use RME in the studio and have an 87 paired with an avalon preamp that I enjoy the sound of, but thought buying an Apollo would be a great portable compromise, cos I hear they have passable pres. That combined with either LCD-X or Focal Clear MG Pro for quiet environments and HD25 for everything else. I'm a huge fan of portability and minimalism, so although I have quite a bit of gear in the studio, it's all powered by 1 MBP, 1 iLok and 1 SSD. Which is always with me.",

A while back we discussed here in reference to a podcast I believe  ruairi posted , about using feel in mixing . I\u2019m interested if anyone here has a particular vision about how one can compensate for or say goodbye to that specific aspect of sound (the feel ) and how useful it is in record making . I think of drums and bass particularly in terms of the frequency ranges and how the transients feel on my ears / chest / belly etc for the different parts. Any vision on how headphones mixing : mastering can satisfy this",

I\u2019m with you . \n\nI think what I\u2019m wondering about is \u2026..with our modern lifestyles I totally get how the consumer is listening mostly by headphones now . And we as music makers are freed up enormously by working in headphones . I think rod waves album got a Grammy and was mixed on headphones iirc, perhaps it was a number 1 . Anyhoo , so I\u2019m not contesting the movement to headphone mixing , I\u2019m wondering for those who intend to or are doing all their work on headphones \u2026..how will you know how it feels in air ? As one day , the artist will perform it live . I come from club and sound system culture , so the ultimate destination is a wall of speaker boxes \u2026..and in the end music has to be re inforced for public performance . How do we know we ve got that balance right if we don\u2019t use speakers ? (Honest question )",

Vocals and guitar recorded over a 2track beat. I typically throw a Waves L2 on my master, just to bring up the level for the rough bounce, never doing much more than a dB or two of gain reduction. In this case I had the threshold of the L2 set at -3.4. The producer said try -3.5, then back to -3.4, then -3.5\u2026 flipping back and forth seeing what he liked more. I couldn\u2019t hear a difference. (I should say that we weren\u2019t in a well treated room, working on some mid sized genelecs. It\u2019s a  setup neither of us is super familiar with.) He decided -3.4 was better and I was in disbelief that he could even hear a difference. I asked if I could do a blind test to see if he could tell which setting was which. He closed his eyes and I switched back and forth a bunch of times before landing on a setting, and he called it correct three times in a row. He said he could hear something in the kick drum but couldn\u2019t explain more than that.\nI need a sanity check. I know my ears aren\u2019t hall of fame, but I\u2019m still in disbelief that he was able to tell a .1dB difference in volume on the limiter.",

They put electret mics in your ears, record IR sweeps of each speaker in your room through them, then put headphones on, record IR sweeps of those, then have some sort of sum/difference algo that translates it all.\n\nWhen you get measured, go for relatively high SPL sweeps. We tried it at a few different levels and at lower levels, the result was pretty unimpressive.
