    "content": "Today I got a reminder of how important love and care are in what we do. Just wanna give a shoutout to @Nomograph Mastering for all the wisdom shared here on that topic.\n\nLong story short \u2014 I agreed to mix a track for an American rapper who had already been turned down by some A-list mixers, even though the guy had a decent budget. The reason was kinda obvious: he\u2019s got a personality that leans toward OCD, with everything that comes with that \u2014 defensive tone in convos, super long mix notes, and weird stuff like thinking a file sounds different just because it was renamed. (I forgot to label one file as \u201cref. limited\u201d like the previous versions, and even though it was literally the exact same file, he swore the \u201cnon-limited\u201d one had a different top end.)\n\nStuff like that made me seriously consider walking away from the project like the others did \u2014 I could just feel the back-and-forth drama coming. But after my first instinct, I remembered a lot of what\u2019s been talked about here: love, care, and being open to the music and the art. So I decided to try empathy instead of just being a jerk out of frustration.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. After taking a bit of time to really talk to him and show I genuinely wanted to help \u2014 not just as a mixer, but as a human \u2014 I learned he\u2019s totally burnt out and running on fumes 'cause he just became a dad. And I totally get that, since my first kid was born a month ago too. That connection shifted the whole vibe. The next round of notes actually made sense, and we ended up approving the first mix by version 4 \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad at all. Happy client, job done.\n\nNot saying you should hang onto toxic clients, but it was a solid reminder: don\u2019t always go with your first reaction. Sometimes just showing a little care  about the person on the other side can change everything. It did for me this time. And tbh, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve handled it this way if I hadn\u2019t read some of the stuff shared here. So thanks, y\u2019all. This place is gold.",

Had a bigger artist do a feature on a smaller artist\u2019s track that I was working on, he came by my place to track his part for it and ended up being really impressed with the final product and the vibe while recording. He just reached out to come cut vocals for his own stuff, and to write some tracks with us. Feels like a huge get, and I\u2019m so excited he\u2019s trusting us with stuff! Been lurking every conversation in this server and already feel like I\u2019m better equipped for this sort of thing to happen.",

    "content": "\u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d - Ira Glass",

Show your work, show your process, reach out to people, etc etc \n\nSpend some time doing ALL of it, and then figure out what rhythms and processes you feel authentic doing. Everything new always feels weird. But suffer though that and find some ways it works for you.\n\nAnd think through it. You *could* send a bunch of DMs that say \"hey you don't know me but listen to my work because I want to work with you.\" Probably send 100 and get a small percentage of those messages returns. Or maybe you should start by posting things you love and tagging the artists. Then if they respond say \"man I'm such a big fan of XYZ song, the way you blah blah blah\" and start things that way. No right or wrong ways. But just use the medium and see what you come up with.\n\nIt's SOCIAL media. If you treat it like \"how can I promote myself,\" that might work. But if you treat it like a platform for interacting and sharing with people and artists and music you love, you'll probably have more success that way.\n\nAlso, it can be a dopamine time suck that eats away at your interactions with the physical world.\n\nSo you just gotta be intentional and see what your capacities are.",

A wannabe Max Martin working with a wannabe mitski and the producer complaining that the artist\u2019s suggestions are making the production hashy and the artist complaining that the producer\u2019s production choices don\u2019t convey enough emotion. \n\nIt\u2019s talking past each-other and not really collaborating.

If what you\u2019re \u201cteaching\u201d doesn\u2019t link with one of these, you\u2019re probably not teaching. And on the hierarchy you want to ideally be closer to the top.

The vibe of the discord is to engage in discussion about all aspects of record-making life, but just posting random recording tutorial videos doesn't really serve this dialog... in fact it disconnects the community and jams up the conversation. It's cool to share stuff, but perhaps at a slower pace with some sort of context and prompt for discussion. Thanks!",

I\u2019m just going to answer what you asked directly, and maybe this week I can take a shot at answering what I think are the underlying themes..\n\n**How do you approach your craft now, in terms of attention to detail**\n\nNothing has changed in terms of my attention to detail, everything gets the same love as it always did. The stakes for errors have gone up - when they are manufacturing 100k copies of vinyl then you have to be sure it\u2019s error free\n\n**Do you reject artists if they approach you to \u201cMaster my album i\u2019ll pay you whatever you want\u201d if you think the level of their sound might not honour your history with all these artists**\n\nI don\u2019t reject *anyone* who can pay my rate. I don\u2019t vet clients on a \u201chow will you make me look?\u201d basis, I\u2019m a service provider to them. There are very very occasionally mismatches where I\u2019ll say \u201chappy to do this but I think you\u2019d be better served by XYZ\u201d, an example being someone coming to me with EDM who wants really intense processing - another girl or guy steeped in that genre will serve them better\n\n**How does it feel having a connection to these artists?**\n\nIt feels really nice to be trusted with people\u2019s art, when someone like a St. Vincent says \u201cyeah, this is good\u201d it matters to me, she has great ears and taste so it feels good to hit a mark\n\nIt\u2019s also very special to hear these things come out of the speaker for the first time - I\u2019ll never forget hearing Nick Cave, or Taylor or Lana in the room for the first time. It\u2019s a privilege to be trusted with their art\n\n**but does it ever happen that you are wanting more?\u201d**\n\nI\u2019m human and can be reliably trusted to do all the silly human things like being greedy, insecure, fearful etc. but every year I get a little better at living a better way, and around the music in particular my operating principles \u201cThe why\u201d feel better and truer than they ever have",

Instead of chumming it up with the band trying to fend off boredom while Eric was mid task, I stuck around on the couch\u2026 watching patiently. Those were the moments where he would start looping me into what he was doing, explaining his techniques. Before I knew it, I could start anticipating what he would need next. Someone mentions trying some vocals on a thing? I immediately got going on setting up a mic, getting headphones, even starting to dial in a mix on the headphone box. Percussion? Grab the trunk of junk and start laying out potential options. Once I started actually being useful, I\u2019d be given real tasks. \u201cHey, do you think you could try doing a preliminary comp of this vocal?\u201d I had been in the room for all the vocal takes, heard the discussion about approach and vibe, even made the singers coffee the right way\u2026 why not? That evolved into being trusted with recording stuff in the second studio\u2026 we were always running behind, and having me chip away at guitar tracking or re-amping was really useful. Years of this and we were a well oiled machine. I\u2019d get looped into pre-production phone calls and meetings, he would start asking my opinion on things.. drum sounds, microphone choices.",

    "content": "Awesome. I'm seeing this right now with a friend's band, so ima jump on the bandwagon here. I just took over mixing the album, which has been in progress for years. Everybody tells me the producer/band leader is this prolific asshole, constantly blowing up at people and impossible to please. The previous mixer had been mixing this thing for months/over a year and everyone was worn out/not getting results. I was really reluctant to take on the project for fear of being intimidated/failing to deliver.\n\nI've made a point of greeting the producer at every step with clear communication, enthusiasm, and an open mind. I genuinely love the music and have made a point of letting him know how much fun it's been to work on the stuff. And, similar to your story, we were basically approved on the first track within 4 mixes and the guy seemed really really happy.\n\nEveryone just said this guy was a hopeless asshole, but what I saw was a guy who was working so hard to bring a vision to life and just struggling to get there; self-financing, overseeing everything, etc... and it's fairly complex, hip hop and soul vibes with practically a full orchestra and 3 vocalists, so it's a lot to manage. Not trying to excuse the asshole behavior, but I see the frustration and I really wanted to highlight how much cool work he had done and that, without any fuss or needless back and forth, we would just get it where it needed to go. i tried to just think about how exciting it could be to finally hear these songs that've been bouncing around in his head actually come out of the speaker the way he imagined. We've got 7 songs almost done now and I've grown so much just from these attitude alignments i've picked up from spending time here.",

I would not describe that as \"a lot of the mastering processes happening in the mixing stage.\" For me, mastering is the process by which I 100% align the final product with the artistic intent. There's a technical component to that, but there's also a huge component of that that is pure vibe. Can I enhance the feeling of this song without getting in the way? Is the feeling of this song fully realized? Is the feeling of these songs together fully realized? Uncovering all that to me is the job. Sometimes it's already there and there's very little, if anything, to do. The perspective is still valuable. The key here is somebody who both understands the technical aspects of the job as well as somebody who can internalize and FEEL the music. The latter is why I believe mastering is one of the most misunderstood processes.",

I've thought about this a lot lately - the idea that things outside myself happening randomly might result in something beautiful, non-2nd-law, that there's a future for my kids. Been struggling with the death of a very close friend for the last 6 months, and I (for some reason, I'm not going to defend or explain it) started reading the works of Rene Gerard, the mimetic desire philosopher (\"Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind\" etc.) Previously I had read more stoic philosophy and resonated with that. Historically I come from a Christian perspective, though never bought into evangelicalism even as a kid.\n\nSo, something very bad happened, and it rocked me harder than anything has in a long time. Spoke at my friend's memorial, told part of his life story, and wept with hundreds of people. Didn't end for me there, though. Became very... depressed is probably the wrong term. Nihilistic is closer, but also wrong. Maybe just \"not hopeful\".\n\nDon't really have a logical conclusion for this, like I usually try to have, except to say: I still believe in beautiful things, people, experiences. Coffee while my kids chat with me in the morning. Sitting on the porch watching the sun rise earlier. And I do believe that all manner of things will be well in the end, and I choose to relax that tense knot inside myself, and I choose to move forward, and grow or decline, and move forward with as much grace as I can muster. I don't surf, and I find the overuse of the analogy annoying, but yes, to surf through the ups and downs instead of trying to master the waves.",

    "content": "Fun question! I hate to complicate an already nuanced premise at the outset, but when I observe my own choices and think of each category I see myself living both sides of all three spectrums, but in different domains:\n\n**For example:** I could be short-term in career objectives and overt achievement and long-term oriented in relationships and satisfaction. Cutting edge in creative pursuits, but classics in my personal taste. Specialist in my mode of expression, and generalist in my interests.\n\nThe more I subdivide and examine the question the more I find exceptions to everything. I am steeped in knowledge, but I seek wisdom above most things, which some philosophies would consider contradictory.\n\nThis Anais Nin quote comes to mind:\n\n> \"We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made of layers, cells, constellations.\"\n\nI think people are extremely lopsided and unbalanced when you start to drill down into their psyches, and that's wonderful! \n\nFor the sake of refining this question and narrowing the scope, should we confine these three axis to only record making? Or do we want to approach it in a holistic sense?",

It would give me tremendous sway over the music industry once everyone comes to recognize that I can't miss. I would leverage that influence to make some positive changes where I can. Set up some institutions to cultivate and nurture the next generation of artists. \n\nPresumably, while the hit music I\u2019m making runs counter to my personal tastes, it seems reasonable that it would still be valuable to *someone*. Just not to me. That will be my curse. I would dutifully churn out hits as fast as I am able to and gift humanity with a tsunami of unimpeachable pop awesomeness that will endure for a century. My sacrifice would be everyone else\u2019s gain.\n\nCounter-intuitively, by saturating the market with my personal brand of songwriting it would inspire the next generation of songwriters. Unable to compete with my torrent of sure-shot pop badness they would respond by writing new music that is the direct antithesis of my own brand of hits. With a little luck, the musical output of these writers would be exactly what I wished to hear all along.\n\nThat\u2019s a win/win right there. I just have to suffer a bit. I choose *Option #1*.",

We were gonna just spend the weekend in the studio together and make sure the vibe was right... turns out I got roped into one of his rounds of speaker moving fuckery. The speakers were his giant UREI 813c's on top of these custom subs... very heavy... and only sitting on cinder blocks. He was deep down a Fuzzmeasure rabbit hole and we were just moving, shooting, moving, shooting, moving back, shooting, etc, etc. When we'd finally make a change to the speaker position that seemed listenable, that was always the first song he would play to hear the speakers, followed by Back in Black. It's one of those few songs that's just cemented in my brain from hearing it so much -- like when you leave an image on a TV screen and it burns in -- that's that song in my ears.",

Into the coaxial cable that runs into the center console, for that true old analog gold plated warmth. Turned the windows and volume all the way up, then as I prepared to hit play. I was blanketed with the all to familar tension. That very same feeling from when I was going to have to sit next to one of the two dudes on the middle school basketball team. Who took as their daily task, to pay homage to ancestral animal social structures, by drowning any nearby male counter part with sack taps, donkey punches, and nail whip flicks. You just preemptively flinch at the inevitable pain from their onslaught. I hit play on a mix that is -5.8 lufs at peak. No proverbial donkey punch to my thighs this time. The song didn't overload the speakers at any point. As I heard the mix in my studio. I heard it here. The things I loved about it. I loved it here. The things I was unsure about. I was equally unsure about them here. My eyes welled up a bit with fulfillment and gratitude. It took me longer and cost more than I could of ever imagined, when I started this journey. But I got here. No longer do I have to worry about translation of the mix. I can focus all my worry on the feeling and vibe of the performace. I'm willing to let my ego have this one, this mix punches with any modern mix on earth. On any system. (Sounds killer on the Meta Ray Bans. And those speakers are rutheless honest. Ive heard alot of overloaded low end mixes on em) And back to the gratitude. I wanted to thank this place. I couldn't have done it without yall. I'd still be in a pitch black room looking for a switch that felt like it was hidden on the ceiling. Now back to work! Have a great day yall!!",

There\u2019s a camaraderie and kinship in physical labour on construction projects, and an embodied intelligence in that world that offsets the subjective and (for me) atomised work of hours alone mixing.\n\nWhen I\u2019m doing construction work, I\u2019m also free to think objectively and from a distance about my audio engineering work.\n\nMost of all, something changes for me when I\u2019m being paid for musical \u201cwork\u201d that I\u2019m not entirely happy with. I\u2019ve discussed this privately with a few folks here, and it seems the relationship between music and its commodification is problematic for more than a few of us. Simply put, it\u2019s sometimes less enjoyable \u2014 though equally amazing \u2014 being paid for a passion.\n\nI couldn\u2019t recommend a construction or skilled trade career enough. It\u2019s incredibly flexible and offers a tonic to music careers: you know you can walk onto a site tomorrow and get paid quickly and well. It\u2019s always going to be around, and in my case, the certifications allow me to consider migrating to most economies globally as a skilled worker.\n\nConstruction allows me to be my own patron for my musical endeavours, and that feels really good.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a bigger debate here about how working in the upper echelons of the music industry feels long term \u2014 challenges, payoffs, economics, job security, retirement, healthcare, family life versus work life, and a world where socialising is networking.\n\nConstruction is a simpler engagement: competency, find a solution, do the work, go home.\n\nI came across @cian riordan discussing becoming a fireman on Conversations, and much of what you said, Cian, is exactly what I get from construction.\n\nI love how for you, though \u2014 instead of the firehouse bell calling, it was multiple Grammys!",

(obviously outliers exist)\n\nI've literally seen art save lives. mental and emotional health is a necessity and music (even sound in general) I find is a key element. \n\na ridiculous amount of cultures (read:indigenous) placed immense value on the art in their culture..often as part of their spiritual beliefs. even colonists co-opted and modified songs to allow conquests though culture more easily.\n\nI think accessibility makes us think art isn't a necessity. it is. a lot of us would probably have lost our minds at this point (and I've seen that happen) if we didn't have it to lean on for various aspects. I'm not saying it should be #1 priority but I do think the inherent value we (the world) give art can directly affect how we value other things \n\nit's also the source of community and support for a lot of people and we are community based beings at our core  (though we can seperate to some extent).\n\nthe mindset things is also v interesting. being from Haiti I see American payment mindsets and European (a lot of both out there) and there's also more traditional ones that are more based in community - usually ones that survived colonialism to some extent. see:taino culture (mostly survived in pr, almost non existent in the other islands now). those are more focused on everyone getting there part fairly. the work is for the community not for yourself. while juxtaposition w the other mindset has flipped some folks' wayof working a lot of them are fine as is.\n\nthere's  o clear solution to the value of art thing. diff fields and different positions have to find ways of presenting value but I see that as a Consequence of the mentality we've adopted not a solution",

It\u2019s about Regaining the Connection to your Senses. \n\nFor a long time now I was living in a kinda \u201cnumb\u201d state where everything I listened to, looked at, tasted, touched and smelled was \u201coverruled\u201d by my rationality (what I would describe as a sixth sense). So I was constantly living in this thing where my rationality dictated my connection to my surroundings, which lead me to be in a very anxious, depressed kind of state obviously reflecting back at my work. \n\nNow with that realisation I started practicing focusing on just on sense at a time, like putting my visual sense in the foreground or just deeply listening and so on. It immediately set back the rationality sense in a way, where it would leave the space to really experience the emotion of the stimulus. \n\nIt really feels great and I want to take a moment to really thank everyone on here for leading the conversation to a better place.

This is a very special corner on the internet for me, and I swear that everytime I read your convos (even the ones I don't interact with) I always take something new with me (a new approach, a bit of inspiration, some insight on how to deal with different situations) and feel grateful for everything that is shared.

I also liked what he had to say on the information he's unintentionally prescribed in past live videos and the Peter Attia quote -- many times i've wondered if a new engineer hears \"I don't compress\" wihtout any context and goes ok, compression is cancelled, but really that was a thing specific to Jon's brain at that time. though yea, a lot of people could get away with compressing *less* lol",

In my experience a big part of true collaboration is having to let go of some control of some parts of the whole thing.  Just putting out there you might be walking away from something really cool in the early stages because of a desire to control every aspect of the project.  It sounds like there are a lot of people that care a lot about the project to invest their time and energy and taste into it.\n\nAgain - you know everything you are feeling and the dynamics and if it's not worth it to you then absolutely walk away.  But maybe worth it to try and make the best of it for another few months and see where it leads?  If you are worried about how other people perceive the marketing/instagram can't you just explain you don't have anything to do with that end of the project?",

There\u2019s a right and a wrong way to do it, and a price to come in at.

The concepts of done and value are much harder to define because it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder. \n\nThen, there\u2019s the specific people. Most people that are in software or data management didn\u2019t grow up going \u201cI WANNA BE IN DATA MANAGEMENT\u201d. They fell in to the field because they had an aptitude for it, were good at numbers, and it was a good way to make money so they can pursue their passion outside their job. With musicians, they specifically ran from that kind of life, the music IS the passion.

Bad For Me by Stacy Ryan (Castelli mix/Becker master) \u2014 so much lows to be for this type of vibe, and like .05 db more in 200ish area would be too much. LOVE how it sits on the edge there, but I\u2019m a big Jon fan so no surprise\n\n2. Disco Break 2 by Brasstracks (Castelli Mix/Becker master) \u2014 crazy good and deep transients with a wonderfully articulate but big low end. Quite dynamic, maybe slightly on the edge there so great to study translation to streaming. Recommended to me by the wonderful @YianniAP \n\n3. 30 for 30 - T Shyne. Not quite sure who mixed it, but I actually DON\u2019T like the lows, or really the overall mix that much as an engineer but there is such a wonderful energy to me, this thing played before a sports game or a workout is it. So I have it here to remind myself that not everything has to be amazing sonically to feel great. Actually don\u2019t like the low end on this at all, but the record still hits for me. Told @alexstein this was on the warm up list\u2026he was like \u201cwhy??\u201d haha. Because I think my job is to love records for what they are and understand why they work, hopefully be more of themselves, not some target curve that\u2019s ideal to me. and this is a great example of something like that\n\nAlso just have to mention that \u201cTattoos\u201d by Georgia Webster is on there\u2026probably my favorite vocal I\u2019ve ever heard. @YianniAP mix Nathan master, I cannot look away from the vocal and the mid density is perfection to me",

Musk noted that the bias tends to be very strongly toward \u201clet\u2019s add this part or process step in case we need it.\u201d Additionally, each required part and process must come from a name, not a department, as a department cannot be asked why a requirement exists, but a person can.\n\n**3) Simplify and optimize the design.** This is step three as the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist.\n\n**4) Accelerate cycle time.** Musk states \u201cyou\u2019re moving too slowly, go faster! But don\u2019t go faster until you\u2019ve worked on the other three things first.\u201d\n\n**5) Automate.** An important part of this is to remove in-process testing after the problems have been diagnosed; if a product is reaching the end of a production line with a high acceptance rate, there is no need for in-process testing.",

Mine is that I wake up almost exactly at the same time every day, will work out at similar times (if possible), literally eat the same thing basically every day before during the work day, coffee at similar times, have  the same routine when I sit down to start work. Not all of that is possible or useful for everyone, but I think we can all find something that would focus us in a way that's useful and ablet to be put into practice for us.\n\nTruly I find it helps a lot. We are physical beings, how our systems and bodies interact can definitely matter, especially in our ability to be available to the music.\n\nThat said, sometimes things happen and you gotta go. You will be tired, stressed, whatever. You have to do excellent work under those conditions too, it might be the most important skill if we are being honest about making a career of this.

But if (a different angle) is what you are going for, (a different suggestion) can be another thing you can try. This, I do more often as a producer. As casual feedback, I don\u2019t do this very often other than people I am close to.",

    "content": "Currently going back and finding/prepping/printing mixes for mastering for a passion project i've worked on-and-off for over 8 years. Some are just printed WAVs from a long distant version of Pro Tools with plugins that don't exist. Luckily I had the foresight to print versions without my obscenely loud 2013 master chain. Some of more recent PT sessions open right up and play back perfectly. The real question is how much to fuck with them before sending them off. When is enough, enough? I've rocked some these mixes around town in my car for almost a decade. It almost feels wrong to mess with the mixes, but there's just so much that can be improved upon. Makes me realize how much of the work we do is emotional and not just technical. Sure, I could improve the low end on a mix, modernize it... but is it worth it?",

It\u2019s mostly an organizational tool for me, and keeps the artist in the loop with the process being a collaboration",

But depending on your social circles you're just as likely to find some people who take it way too far, and that's something that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It gets pretty chauvinistic.\n\nPatriotic rhetoric ends up being a lever used by politicians and adjacent political influencers to rally people to their causes (no surprise there), but lately it's mutated into a particularly ugly form and now there's a stark divide between people who have been radicalized towards extreme political positions and those who would reject them. One group unite under this brand of souped-up patriotism and the other tends to reject patriotic displays entirely because it resembles the first group.\n\nNo doubt you can find this behavior in lots of places around the world, but America's been feeling extremely polarized lately and overt national pride ends up being a symbol that's been co-opted by one group. So people here can be squeamish about it.\n\nYou'll likely be fine if you want to fly your American flag proudly. I don't want to dissuade you.

There was a very \u201calive\u201d life to the hardware that really transformed the keys part -~~ the soundtoys sounded comparatively like a blurry stereo gauze around the sound (but can be cool as its own thing).~~ [*That was my memory this morning of what it sounded like in 2019 - see edit below though, I now disagree with my memory*] \n\nThe closest I got to the \u201cspirit\u201d of the hardware was the microshift section of the Ultrachannel strip. It\u2019s definitely not for everything, but on that occasion it made the most sense.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s interested I can share some of the channels (wurli, gtrs, and BVs) and the hardware H3000 returns I printed so you can see for yourself what gets you there.\n\n\n[*Out of interest I reopened the session just now and tried out Soundtoys Microshift again - it's not bad at all. I'd even say that somehow sonically it's closer to the hardware than Ultrachannel, but still I think Ultrachannel gets closer to the spirit/vibe/neurophysiological impact of the hardware H3000 patch.*\n\n*Here's the patch I made in Ultrachannel - if anyone wants the session with parts to compare, DM me: https://strongroomstudios-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ross_strongroom_com/EvlK_gdag9dFhrmOQasFPt0BCPTv0qnr3Hiu3dwoLx5DrQ?e=A2m9u7*]",

Things like vibe and being a good hang. \n\nThird: singing ideas *at* a vocalist is not nearly as effective as you might think. However good a singer you are, when you sing an idea they\u2019re going to hear so much more than you intend, and will likely mimic things you\u2019re not trying to convey. It can be more detrimental than you\u2019d think. \n\nAll that said- focus on learning each artist individually, create an environment of trust and respect, and when the time is right, you\u2019ll know how  to offer insight.

    "content": "Yeah for sure! Sounds like you're on a good path!! Totally understand the hesitation to delegate - especially that first 6 months-a year where you're acutely aware that helping someone else do it is *more work* than just rolling up your sleeves and doing it yourself. \n\nFor building systems, what's worked for me is hiring and training your 'double(s)' first - someone with a similar skillset and sensibilities, very broad skills like me (who also did everything myself for a long time). This comes a lot easier if you have close friends in the same lane looking for jobs, I've seen people have their \"double(s)\" move in with them for a limited time too, with the intention of them soaking in exactly all you do.\n\nOnce my double(s) started doing pretty well, we started hiring more specialized people, and the doubles could then oversee their work, feedback etc - early on I would always be part of this, then slowly phase myself out.\n\nWhat I wish I would have done earlier would have been to hire a producer/overseer/manager/'my boss' - someone with a bit more skin in the game/responsibility, and who keeps you in line if you start wavering. \n\nAgain, I didn't love the setup of 10 and dissolved it eventually - as a creative it's easy to feel like you built a house/efficiency machine and one day you wake up and it's a prison that's not as flexible as you want. That's another thing I'm trying to keep in mind (I'm putting together a new similar team for this fall) - how do you keep the team agile and ready to shift when priorities shift? It could be as easy as accepting a little bit more churn & letting people go when they don't fit what's going on, but it's hard to let go of people you've trained and know well. I felt a friendship connection with my entire team, in hindsight I think that was a mistake too.\n\nThose are some thoughts haha - what have you found so far? Are you experiences lining up with mine? What kind of roles are you hiring for?",

Especially when you don't know someone personally.\n\nWhen the reality is if you really do this -- it's a grind and there is a lot of uncertainty, even when things are going very well. The perseverence and grit it takes to succeed is often undervalued and underdiscussed, as well as how there are waves to inspiration, how you relate to the work, etc (which is why discipline is paramount)",

    "content": "If the alternative is to back home, I\u2019ll try to offer some advice from personal experience. I moved to Richmond, VA for a year, got a job at a hotel doing audio visual. I quit my first commercial/post production gig doing ads full time. It was the worst but I was determined to keep working in music, and try to get integrated in the scene/studio world. It was a serious low for my mental health, the job was terrible, I was struggling and scraping by without any pay off. To make a long story short, I applied for a job back home at a big corporate company with a full time composition/post production gig, on a whim - I didn\u2019t think it would get me anywhere. 3 months later I got the job and went back home after a year. I was out of the music scene back home at this point, and it took another year of reconnecting and working hard on my craft with friends who were willing to let me record their bands for the price  of drums heads and guitar strings, and honestly, those two things combined with some luck put me in a very secure and creative place, now making records for bands again that are paying decently well to boot. I don\u2019t know how far you are in your career/journey, but I\u2019m barely anything and have been recording for 15 years. It took me 5 years out of school to get barely a living wage and working lots of different types of audio jobs while making records, to get to a comfortable place emotionally, creatively, and financially. I\u2019d bet almost anybody in this discord has a very similar story. It takes a long time and like others have said, there\u2019s no one way to get there. Just keep doing you and trying to work on things that you enjoy.",

Lots of exciting and novel tools exploding right now that are threatening to replace certain modes of illustration, writing, programming, and audio.\n\nIt seems likely that certain roles for creators are going to be diminished. Photography was a huge blow to illustrators when it emerged. Portraiture and photo-realism used to be the domain of painters. But when those skills became trivially easy to replicate the next generation of painters had to pivot into something else that played to the unique strengths of painting. I can't say what the actual causation is for sure, but the entire 20th century was dominated by abstract representation in painting, as one example of what that shift might look like.\n\nPerhaps as creators our domains will need to shift into something else. Something more taste-driven and creative.\n\nThese AI tools can emulate pre-existing material well, but they still lack creativity, taste, and informed judgement. So I think the roles that are likely to remain (until another massive development) are matters of taste and curation. Somebody still needs to steer these tools to make something useful or novel.",

My job is about realizing someone else's vision and pushing that to be the best it can be. If you're being hired as a producer, then like me, you have to believe that you're being hired for your taste and perspective. So the question is, why doesn't it feel good to you? Is there something undiscovered that could make it better?\n\nI've written a lot of music that's outside of my aesthetic or personal tastes. But if I'm on the project, I'm going to be 100% invested in helping make that thing what it needs to be. There's a way into music that's outside of your vibe - sometimes it's getting excited about new techniques, sometimes it's exploring a genre you're unfamiliar with, and sometimes it's just because the people you're making music with are a good hang. Sometimes, the role of a composer (or producer) is to take their vision and find the version of it that **does **get you excited. We've probably all had that experience of \"I really never listen to X, but this one song/artist is just undeniable.\" So strive for that.",

Really interesting stuff, and @BatMeckley made me start thinking about it more with his comment about guitar gear. We as a collective grow and evolve over time and go through cycles but there are fundamentals that still remain true. We want to capture the emotion and represent something that will best suit the song. Different production and mixing styles help accomplish that but it\u2019s cool to see how things change over time.

The hardest part is to think to do it. \n\nSo we\u2019re all informed by our taste, and we\u2019re all chasing the sounds we love, and we\u2019re all trying to make a living by finding where our tastes overlap with a broader audience. \n\nIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re driven by dark playlist overlords, is that the search of overlap in our tastes finds us all in that domain.

There\u2019s no point worrying about something because if you can\u2019t change it why worry and if you can, change it so you don\u2019t have too. A huge simplification but something I find helpful with dealing with tough times in a studio. \n\nYou can get that weird moment in a session when something goes wrong  usually the best course of action is to be a positive and hopeful force for the band or artist to rely on. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this sorted as quickly as possible and get back to work\u201d\nDeep down I don\u2019t think anyone really thinks you\u2019re responsible for what ever happened, they\u2019re just looking for a solution. Except of course Trevor, Trevor knows you did it and he\u2019s mad. \n\nLol but really sessions are emotionally intense situations and places and sometimes that can boil up in interesting ways.",

You help them realize their vision all the way through and it still doesn't feel good to you or any other involved party other than the artist. What then?\n\nI'm curious to hear some thoughts on the producer's perspective and the artist's perspective.

There is also a lot of pushing and pulling the artists to fit their expectations instead of serving the art and letting nature take its course. Specifically theres a lot of \"I can't wait to help you realize the full expression of your music and art when we work together!!!!!!!!\" kind of vibe which is great internally but puts off older artists a little bit. I've seen it a lot over the last couple years with young producers and engineers and I wonder if its because of the pandemic, honestly. The whole \"check list to success\" thing is another good point. Some things are not easily repeatable or scalable with the expectation of the same result every time.",

Questionable with regards to how we currently define art vs/and success.\nI think we're maybe in a chapter where our phone lenses offer us a portal to a global connection on the positive side, yet also a massive distraction from living life in the first person ....if my approach when im thinking about art is that once ive finished the creation, i now have to give the majority of my effort to making it grab peoples' attention.....i feel like that risks changing the intent.\nThis intent of course would be shaped by how one defines art vs/and success. \nIf the success of art is defined by its popularity (drake) i think this fellow's advice must be the MO....if the success is defined by a different metric , im not so sure its the right move to place so much weight on one's relationship with the external (the phone lens, the social media) and id weight it more on one's relationship with oneself , in spite of the world.",

Forget about the record you're working on for as long as you can afford to, listen to great music of a similar genre, that really inspires you, and come back to it. Usually when I do that I'm flooding with inspiration and ideas when I come back. That's just my experience anyway!! Could be helpful for you",

After so many of years of being on the recording side of the glass and recording myself every day, I find myself forgetting what it would be like to trust someone else to record or mix something I\u2019m creating. A lot of my thought process is on \u201cfinishing\u201d and \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. I often wonder if I\u2019d be as open minded as a musician in a band in a studio as I try to encourage my clients to be. For example, using someone else\u2019s gear, the engineer making bold mix decisions/production choices, adding parts, etc. obviously some of these boundaries should be set before you dive in deep into a project. What are things that the musicians are thinking/experiencing emotionally I might be overlooking?",

The reality is, for a lot of artists, we may be their first recording experience, their first record, etc and they\u2019ll grow a LOT during and move on and grow. I think this was mentioned In the Conversations podcast. So for me sometimes it\u2019s letting certain things go that aren\u2019t going to change in someones performance and trying to make it work. I did a pretty emo influenced record recently, and the vocalist isn\u2019t the best. I tried to give him tons of vocal tips and train him the best I could, and it ultimately made it so much harder to record him because it sounded so unnatural and unemotional. We ended up using a lot of earlier scratch takes for certain songs (and they feel super good/relatable/captivating even though it\u2019s maybe nasally) and then using particularly emotional driven takes at the very end. I think there\u2019s a balance of being honest/giving feedback and being delicate/not destructive in your response. Also, @oaklandmatt , your point about learning 10 different ways to say something needs to be better, is spot on.",

I realized years later that almost all my completed songs with lyrics came from those bits of writing so I think I need to go back to that! (I don\u2019t write lyrics a lot anymore).\n\nFor the music aspect, I relied heavily on just pure instinct / jam it out for so many years, but working on commercial music made me start to set a lot more intention in my writing which helped immensely in all aspects. I guess my favorite thing is mostly to try to write a fully structured song in a day (4-5 times a week). The limitation of a day gives me enough flexibility to actually create and record an entire track while also not getting TOO hung up on writing a verse, chorus, bridge, etc. there\u2019s no time to overthink!",

An engineer I know once told me a good one that was if you want an artist to sound more seductive/sexy as they perform, but don't want to make them feel embarrassed by saying that, you should tell them to sing like they're trying to sell a box of chocolates. Weirdly, it works !",

More recently, when James Horner died during the scoring of The Magnificent Seven, his assistant/arranger finished the score. \n\nThe difference between this and the pop example is there is no AI technology used to imitate the person, which feels like a parlor trick to me. I am all for finishing unfinished art, but unless there was an express wish from the artist to use their voice via AI tech, then I say make it known what it is. Finish the production by bringing in other people to celebrate the spirit of the original voice. Pay tribute. Sort of like Japanese Kintsugi, where you're drawing attention to what it's not to elevate what it is. (This is not the intention of kintsugi exactly, but I can't think of a better metaphor at the moment).",

I suppose in a sense, if we think of the signal flow from mic through analogue electrical circuits , back out to analogue at a listeners speaker......I\u2019m fascinated with how sonic information and its identifying qualities (such as harmonic content of an instrument , and its pitch....and say for a vocalist for example .....how does the character of a consonant .....or a vowel...how is this encoded into an electrical circuit to then again be recreated into an identifiable analogue reproduction upon return to the world of sound waves ? How do we manipulate these harmonics in a controlled way electrically And how did we discover this ? It\u2019s imho mind blowing ......\n\nto your point about the complexity of understanding distortion , I feel like maybe this is what I\u2019m going to need to understand \n\n I need to find the answer in physics as to how can a voice be transmitted as an electron flow, then re rendered as a human voice again .....its  fascinating to think a voltage / current can carry the information that is someone\u2019s voice and the emotion of a performance \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.

Instead of explaining, it\u2019s better to do it and show it.\n\nMy humble take: our job is not necessarily doing what we\u2019re told. it is to take their vision, and take it to a place where they could say \u201cwow- I didn\u2019t know this is what I wanted but this is what I want now\u201d. Which I think is the taste and perspective factor. \n\nIt is case by case of course and some artists could come in with A to Z manual of what they want, which can be cool- or not. I personally find those boring, unless I really admire their vision and it just feel like an honor to be a part of it. I think being a yes man can be a quick way to become dispensable. But someone who is willing to serve by giving you some friction that can turn into some heat \ud83d\udd25 can be someone they find trustworthy and interesting. It\u2019s case by case dependent, some people need perfect aerodynamics to accelerate their vision, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily being a yes man- but rather about just being the right fit for the project and being someone who is fully on board to do what they are asking. \n\nBut I think more importantly- it\u2019s okay to miss. If they don\u2019t like it - then scrap it or give it another go. And it\u2019s also fine if you end up not being the one for the project",

Younger me had no idea how long it would take to truly become great at something. A lot of emphasis placed here (in a practical and useful way I would add) on honing your skills, getting reps, practice, patience, developing taste, etc... On the journey to great you must survive. The harder it is to survive (i.e. cost of living, shit wages, inflation, healthcare, etc...) the more time you have to spend on survival and the less time you have to develop yourself. I remember when I moved to Nashville in 2011 people called it a five year town now I hear folks saying it's a ten year town. I'm hopeful my cousin, relating back to the OG thread, has the opportunity time affords to take a real crack at it and develop into a great artist if he so chooses.",

    "content": "a great read thanks Anthony, v informative \n\nQuote :  . \u201cGreat dance music is constructed as much from silence as it is from sound; what gets left out is as important as what goes in.\u201d \n\n......and so the truth was spoken ..\n\nInteresting to me, was the mention of Timmy regisford , as his shelter club being mentioned by interviews with Dennis ferrer was what first caught my ear to the wave of NY house coming out just as uk garage was beginning to tire and split into UK funky, grime and dubstep . I went into UK Funky and we were all listening to Ferrer and Chandler .....Quentin Harris was another great dj with some great tracks at that time .....we had a club in London called the east village which was explicitly mimicking the Manhattan east village vibe at the time and Quentin Harris held a night there monthly I\u2019d go down to .\n\nV v cool. \n\nHe and Dennis personified the concept of using space and silence in a production imho .\n\nCheck Dennis ferrer - touched the sky . This tune was huge here . Wonderful house production \n\nAnd Quentin Harris remix of Justin timber lake \u201cwhat goes around \u201c ....a beguiling steady building deep groove .\n\nThe opening  section to sonny fodera and MK,s  \u201casking \u201c (out now ) reminded me of proper house and garage from the late 90s / early 00,s like Rui da silva touch me and trippin by gold trix feat Andrea brown \n\n.....and it had me thinking about doing a few house and garage tracks again myself. The hip hop culture imho has become stagnant and toxic at the mo imho and I don\u2019t perceive much  appreciation for artistry as it stands.....feel myself drifting off into other genres ...\n\nMaybe time to swap the 808 back to the 909",

Everything that concerns \u201cme\u201d starts with working on myself. \n\nBut my belief as someone who makes art; it is my job to be concerned about it, and spend time pondering on it. I\u2019m not responsible or I can\u2019t be for it, it would be an arrogance and narcissism (or ego centric frame of mind at the very least) to believe that I\u2019m responsible for it or matters in any way - but I think believing that what I do would have no impact on others is inconsiderate. \n\nI believe it would help people find things they like if everyone alivned their taste/values to their individuality; rather than the idea of their individuality.\n\nRe: Korea; \nyou bring up a very good point about this. Korea is an extreme case of collectivism over individualism, and my obsession about this probably stems from growing up in that background. I only truly understand two cultures from first hand experience and that is Korean and North American; but it seems that no matter how culture forms, human nature will always be relevant and it\u2019s in our nature to be want to be accepted, feel included. \n\nI believe that American individualist propaganda is a lie. It\u2019s not about being yourself, it\u2019s rather about finding a box to put yourself in for sake of convenience. i believe it mostly has to do with consumerism and the complexity of the society from immigration and various cultures coming together; converging / diverging at different pace even amongst those that share the same cultural roots- which then later becomes nu-gen X-American culture, which is different from the culture of X. (X being a country/ethnic group)",

I felt the drug of music hit harder early in life (when it was new and less frequently everything I did).  Humans generally have desensitization with frequency of exposure...  and people, Beato included, likely get FEELS less with binge listening and hyper exposure to all music.  That might be some of Beato's grift...  HE doesn't feel music as deeply as his nostalgia days, and assumes its everything but him that causes that. \n\nDavid nailed it too....  and that hits or aligns with the quote I pulled from the comments...  music is made in radically different ways. Does it change the FEELS aspect?   That's probably an individual's subjective value judgement. There's no song that universally hits every human in the same way(s).",

I personally didn\u2019t know what the difference was, now I do so it helps me solve a problem. the way I solved it then was, I just finished the mix and logic clearly what the artist wanted so I\u2019m not going to fight that. It\u2019s all relevant. Also, because I proved trust to work with them over the years I\u2019ve talked them off the ledge and they\u2019re less worried about these small nuances.

So many times I've produced a song, and the demo (with vocals recorded through a voice note on a phone or the likes) has so much vibe and feeling. And as soon as I go record the song properly with the artist, and go do some mixing and cleaning up, it just looses the feeling.\nI mean when I a/b between the demo and the new version, the new one always sounds better technically, but when I listen start to finish it's boring and a flat experience. Not always the case, but it is sometimes for me, and if I knew more about why, I may be able to prevent it happening in the future.\n\nWhat you guys think? Anyone get a similar experience?",

Has there been an in-depth discussion on live or in discord yet about musicians on tiktok? \n\nIt's a crazy scene of selling your creative soul for 1 minute of attempting to go viral. and then if you do get a popular video, whatever that one was - that is now your thing... singing into a trash can doing RHCP covers... ok, now do another 100 of those.  I see so much talent on there, genuine talent and artists who have worked hard on their craft getting 10 views due to the algo... once the algo has tried your vid on a few people and it didn't stick the vid is dead... so it's totally hit and miss based on your first small sample of viewers.\n\nI see this having a huge impact in many ways. On the plus - you are getting exposure to incredible new ideas, skills, trends, methods for being creative... on the negative it's demotivating to the nth degree, and cheapening the creative process, in my opinion.\n\nMatt and Jon recently talked about track lengths getting shorter and shorter, now 2 minutes is the normal. Partly due to the attention span of people... well what is this going to do... 1 minute pop tracks incoming? Just gimme the hook in 30 seconds and let's move on please. :p. How can we get young people to lay on the floor and listen to 10 minute vinyl tracks again? In my opinion humanity NEEDS this :)) \n\nI also swear I've heard the influence of trending memes from tiktok coming through in music in the charts, but cannot really back this up.\n\nWhat's everyone else's thoughts? I have a friend in LA who says everyone has gone crazy there for tiktok fame? \ud83d\ude1b",

Can everything be truly expressed in 1 minute snaps. What about songs that keep you in the vibe and space by having space and time to unfold.... my concern is everything is getting shorter and shorter with tiktok being a big influence. instant gratification, move on, \"i need to find the next hit for my brain\", swipe swipe. this speed, this haste... how is there any chance for music to settle, sit and unfold in the listeners mind? --- and even if you manage that, it's gone almost instantly as they continue swiping for the next \"hit\".",

Is it super loud around there and will be a pain in the ass to track anything, or mix comfortably? Can you make noise? Is there parking for clients? Can you find a room that will work acoustically without structural changes you couldn\u2019t make as a renter? Etc. etc.",

Instead their interest lies in their allegorical representation of people and places. Their unique value lies in the curation of ideas and the story, concept, or idea that they convey. They're telling a pretty sophisticated story under the surface.\n\nLook at these paintings. There's no individual element of either of these that I couldn't render right now with Dall-E and photoshop my own remake together. But right now AI is nowhere close to creating such a cohesive visual composition with it's unspoken message. For now great art still requires a human operator with intention.",

    "content": "I can't stop thinking about this idea of \"Why don't you play something that people actually like?\"\n\nI personally wrestle a lot with the idea of making music *for* other people. It's simply not very high on my list of priorities. I'd say I'm self-centered in how I approach making music. I'm out to make stuff that *I* want to hear. Things that aren't being represented elsewhere. Flavors I've never heard. I'm not aiming for a broad appeal, but I'm also not shying away from it. I'm just not much of a people pleaser in that regard. I'm in it for the discovery and the exploration and the pleasure of making something that excites me.\n\nI think often about that Steve Jobs sentiment of \"People don't know what they want until they see it.\" I think about that a lot. I trust that if I follow what feels good to *me* then I'll get something valuable out of it, and maybe it'll connect with others. If not, that's alright too. I'll know that I've made something that feels great.\n\nI sometimes worry about this because I've always felt that it puts me at odds with a lot of people out here trying to make excellent records. Sometimes our goals will align, but I just don't feel motivated by the need to appeal to a lot of people and that can also make us diverge.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a different kind of taste that I'm trying to cultivate. It's one that runs parallel to the kind of taste that is good at appealing to a large number of people. I feel as if I'm aiming at an entirely different goalpost from people playing the other game. I want to tickle people in a way that they didn't know they were capable of. That's what's thrilling to me.",

There\u2019s no need to plant your flag on the service end of the spectrum if it doesn\u2019t bring you joy and there\u2019s food on your table. And there\u2019s nothing that says you can\u2019t serve clients by day and let creativity run wild by night.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got something profound to say, it would be a damn shame to water it down for the public\u2019s taste.

It just wasn\u2019t natural anymore . It felt perfectly bland . Your rx comments came to mind and I removed pretty much all the corrective inserts , opened up rx and between the magic tool (I found this good for the high end ) and the paintbrush (on the low end /plosives ) I pretty much sculpted the natural sound of the vocal all in rx , without any distractions. Just.....the sound ....of the vocal. Having finished and returning to the mix , it was everything I\u2019d wanted with about a third of the plug in inserts. I\u2019m a major convert to this upstream, approach . In this case it was a vocal but I\u2019m intrigued to apply the principle on a master. The inspiration came from yourself. Thanks man .",

Could be lyrical, emotional, or intentional aspect of the song in the context of music, but it generally has to do with what this piece of art was inspired by and what it is talking about on the inside. I think of it as elements that would make you fall in love with the song even more as you listen to them over and over again- it overlaps with tastiness of the music too, but tastiness you notice right on the get go, while substance ferments over time and grows in my experience. That is not to say you can get hooked by the substance- but I\u2019d definitely say without tastiness, it\u2019s hard to make it to that point.",

(Lol.)\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to live in nyc my entire adult life and never have\u2014it\u2019s never made sense to do it career-wise and probably never really will. But every time I\u2019m there I feel totally at home and happy and excited in a way I don\u2019t anywhere else. I spent a summer there several years ago and always linger as long as I can whenever I can, have close friends there (not in music), end up there usually a couple times a year and relish it every time. I feel like I know it as well as is possible for never having been a resident.\n\nI know the music biz there is pretty much defunct (at least compared to LA), and I really *really* don\u2019t want to repeat the emotional and financial ruin that I experienced moving to LA and restarting everything 6 yrs ago\u2026 but from a non-career perspective it\u2019s where I want to be.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m in it to fucking win it in LA for my career\u2014though with an eye for sure on getting to a point where I can relatively comfortably make that move.\n\nAny wisdom/experience on making a mid-career move like this from folks here? I\u2019m 35 yrs old, some decent credits but not major traction yet, in a basically married but not actually married relationship with a school principal who is into the idea of a move there as well (though our finances are totally separate and I for sure need to earn!), no kids or desire/plan to have kids.\n\nAny benchmarks/goals that might be reasonable to aim for before seriously starting to make moves on this? I\u2019d do it tomorrow if I could, but would also stay in LA for 5+ more years no prob to set things up properly. Even open to things like a podcast (/radio?/other audio prod) gig to help smooth the transition if that\u2019s reasonable to find and lucrative enough\u2014but what I\u2019m really looking for is how to think of this as a full time freelance record maker. Or if someone on here secretly is hiring for staff gigs at Electric Lady, plz lmk \ud83d\ude09",

I\u2019ve heard so many people in my family say they have no musical talent or they\u2019re terrible at piano, but they\u2019ve never practiced for 15 minutes. What\u2019s the measurable difference between Yo-Yo Ma and your uncle?\n\nMy gut feeling is that most of talent comes down to commitment/focus (interest in the craft) and learning styles, and then culture and early exposure mold that into an affinity.\n\nSome people will suck at an art form, put in the work, and then not suck anymore. Some will be born with a brain that\u2019s wired to seeing shapes, and find it easy to visualize patterns on a guitar neck. Some will be auditory learners and may find it easier to learn to identify intervals by ear.\n\nAnd then some people will grow up singing or playing in church, and those people get the cheat codes from a *very* young age while their brains are still spongey, learning things like their first language. Of course they weren\u2019t born playing the organ, but it can look that way from the outside.\n\nIt seems both mystical and defeatist when people who don\u2019t think they have talent talk about people who do\u2014almost like an excuse. And maybe that\u2019s intentional, and exactly the point you\u2019re making.",

    "content": "there are traditional jazz and modern jazz. people who do traditional like to honor the head (the melody of jazz standard). A close friend of mine is a modern Jazz Saxophonist, he said he once broke up with his band after an argument because he didn\u2019t want to play the melody but his band members were more traditional and wanted him to play the head. \n\nImo calling something not Jazz because they aren\u2019t doing the head-solo-head form is like calling modern classical music not classical music because of the aleatoric composition. Somewhat of a valid opinion, but not really. \n\nWould you call wayne shorter not a jazz musician because he writes scores for his band? (well\u2026 he\u2019s also a free jazz musician\u2026) \n\nFor general public, traditional jazz and traditional classical music would be more appealing to listen to for most people due to the predictability factor. Modern classical music and modern jazz is a movement to explore creative possibilities beyond that, but\u2026 it\u2019s often not done so tastefully because they step too far off the predictability.\n\nBut Jazz is a free form of expression. I think a lot of non-jazz musicians hate on Jazz because it\u2019s somewhat cerebral (it really isn\u2019t once you get past it\u2026 which I couldn\u2019t just yet), and a lot of people choose music because of its unexplainable magic people experience from it. It\u2019s only natural that the same people that was attracted to the unexplainable nature of music being turned off by the explainable nature of harmonies and rhythms. Jazz noobs and Berklee kids may make it look like that what Jazz is about and some have elitism behind it too, but that\u2019s not jazz. All the theory and stuff is a door you go through to be able to step into the world of self expression with an open form. (to be fair many old school jazz musicians solely played by ear with no knowledge in music theory. because\u2026 it all comes from their ears at the end of the day)\n\nWhether one wants to sit through someone expressing themselves is theirs to decide.",

Has huge sine bass notes in a few sections that were chattering a bit with the short iZotope maximizer release. This mixer uses the same limiter setting on every mix and I copy it and work from non limited mix, sometimes tweaking slightly\n\nSo bass distortion sounds cool to me, but more importantly it was in the REF. So to my mind it\u2019s cool and in the artist\u2019s signpost of intention \u2026. But they wanted it clean (which was possible and pretty easy)\n\nI guess the message and the reason for putting it in general is that we\u2019re all under the gun with deadlines, and all through the process there can be a sense of it\u2019s just a demo, just a producer ref,. just a mix ref \u2026. we\u2019ll nail it later.

Some reactions are merely state of mind, until it is given a name. Some reactions are visceral because of what the chemicals do to our body. \nsometimes, it\u2019s neither visceral nor label-able. Which makes us assume that it\u2019s not a feeling or emotion. But can we really differentiate emotions and thoughts? What exactly would differentiate them? \n\nOn the other hand, there is music that pushes more, versus music that pulls more. \n\nJust like how audio is bipolar, we can\u2019t have connections just be a one way communication. Tame Impala is a type of music that pulls. You don\u2019t know why, but you just want to know \u201cwhat was that song? I GOTS TO FIND OUT\u201d. \n\nPush is more like\u2026 \u201cI can\u2019t unhear it\u201d a lot of Pop hits are push with some pull factor. \n\nthe ones that make you bummed out that you couldn\u2019t shazam are ones that pull you in. it\u2019s a slight push that gets you listening, and the rest of it is just pulling you in. (my own reaction when I first heard tame impala and couldn\u2019t find out whose song it was)\n\nCulturally, I think the love for (dreamy sound) can be explained with a desire to escape reality. \n\nSo really, the emotional reaction is that \u201cit transports me into a different space\u201d. My theory on \u201cwhy do people like that feeling?\u201d is that many people aren\u2019t happy with the reality of our lives because of economy and what not. And the idea of \u201cescape from reality\u201d became more and more a viable thing for us to want after experiencing digital devices and internet.",

To become the most whole version of themselves, imho. \n\nYour job as a producer is to create a safe and encouraging space where they can explore and express it, say scary things, move forward in their ideas. It\u2019s also your job to then facilitate the process at every stage, musically and otherwise, to make sure the execution is as good as it can possibly be.

I actually think it's pretty clever to individually record their parts in this kitchen, then all come together to lip sync it. I'm also not the target audience and this stuff all feels too forced/ canned for my music taste. \n\nJust interesting to me the levels that people are going to from an engineering and technical standpoint to make spontaneous-looking social media content. \n\nIs there a lot of this? Are there other things like this? What kind of other shenanigans are people getting up to that the layperson doesn't know about?",

    "content": "Thank you all for chiming in on this, it really got me thinking! I took some time to dig deeper into my uncomfort with this topic and I think it\u2019s really just about the concept of a \u201cpersonality trait\u201d. Maybe we can jam a little on it.\n\nI had this example in mind:\nLet\u2019s say we meet someone for the first time and while we\u2019re interacting I gather that this person seems like a \u201chappy person\u201d, they\u2019re smiling, giving off warm vibes and are kind. We keep on meeting this person and the experience repeats itself. So the more we meet, the more our idea that this person must be a \u201chappy person\u201d solidifies. We know of course that this is an abstraction and that the person is probably going to be sad, angry, etc. at times. \n\nNow let\u2019s say we think, man I really liked this person they are so easy to deal with, I enjoyed every bit of our interaction. I wish more people would be like that! And there you go. Now you are set to figure out all the details about happiness, the factors that make a \u201chappy person\u201d a \u201chappy person\u201d. The warmness, the kindness etc. and help people be more happy. \n\nNow you\u2019re really digging into it, you start making videos, writing blogs going out to teach happiness. People are really digging it and you feel like you\u2019re doing good for the world. So the concept is in everyone\u2019s mind happiness is what we should strive for and whoever is not happy enough yet just needs to try harder. Suddenly you\u2019re watching the news and you hear more and more people are getting symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety. And you think to yourself wow how did that happen? I thought I was making   the world a better place. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with a lot of these concepts that once they get institutionalized or gain popularity they somewhat lose their initial intent and can even have a rebounding effect. I mean we can see it going that way with a lot of different trends like mindfulness, health awareness, the work life balance etc.",
