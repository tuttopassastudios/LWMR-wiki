He said.\u201d did you look me up?\u201d I said no I just texted you like I was asked. He said.\u201d you should look me up.\u201d he proceeded to tell me  he\u2019s been signed to major label  for 25 years. Supposedly Warner brothers and followed with they gave him $600 to mix this album which then I said I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t help you.. he said \u201csend me a number of someone who can mix a jazz album.\u201d I sent him to a friend who I know it was hurting for work.. then he text me back about five minutes later and said this guy never mixed a jazz album before. Send me  somebody who mixed a jazz album preferably over 40. I sent him Al Schmitt\u2019s contact and he responded to me. \u201cAll has  been dead for several years get with it man.\u201d\n\nthere\u2019s nothing to be learned here.",

    "content": "...completely unrelated to anything  but on my mind this morning\n\nSomething I've said here (maybe too) often is that approaching the work in a loving way is a real unlock. Love being a quaity of a attention, a way of meeting things. It might not be obvious but it can start small and grow out embracing many more aspects of what we do\n\nI mastered an album a few months back for a phenomenal indie artist, @Rob Domos and I both absolutely loved the music and the overall experience. The artist's team came back this week with a last minute request to remaster what was probably my favorite track with an added feature from a legacy artist. It's kind of mind bending how much better it is\n\nRob and I spent some time yesterday just appreciating that someone (the artist, manager, A&R?) actually thought up the idea of this feature and made it happen. I was so content with what it was but someone somewhere was like *\"you know what would be sick ...\"* and made it real. And now the world gets to receive something beyond what we could have imagined, something we didn't even know we needed\n\nJust focussing our attention on that for 2 mins in the hall yesterday made the day better and put some gas in the tank. There are so many challenges in what we do, it really helps to take time to focus attention on the jewels strewn everywhere too. They are not always immediately obvious",

    "content": "So, early in working with Cavallo we we\u2019re doing a project at Skywalker Ranch in Nor Cal, living there for about 6 weeks. And he would unwind by cooking the staff these huge dinners in the industrial kitchen and then when they all retired for the night he would crack a bottle of wine and just talk shop with me for an hour or two. One night we\u2019re talking about mixers, and I mentioned doing a project with another producer where one of the big big big name mixers had tanked the record. And he said \u201cwell whose fault is that?\u201d And I responded the mixers obviously, it was awesome when we sent it to him. And he said \u201cno, with all due respect, it\u2019s the producer\u2019s job. I sent back *grammy winning record here* 12 times to that mixer because the mix was just not quite right. As a producer your only job at the end of the day is \u2018can i stand behind this record, is this the best the artist could possibly put out. Does it rule\u2019. THAT is the job of a producer. A guy like Fields might get there by re playing all the instruments when the band leaves. A guy like Rubin might give them a reading assignment. They\u2019re both equally producers because at the end of the day their records are consistently quality, however they get there. THAT is the job. The rest is just details\u201d\n\nThe people that know how will always work for the people that know why. \n\nThat lesson was invaluable to me.",

I crushed it on a deadline, then that same A&R hired me a year later to work on a band called Emblem 3 who was on X Factor US as well. I crushed that and then six months after that he recommended me to a UK A&R who was having trouble finishing a song for One Direction. I did a spec production on the song Best Song Ever and they liked it and used it and all of a sudden I become a big pop producer.

I was initially on the fence, but am very glad I went. \n\nJon & Teezio were amazing together. I don't know how often MWTM does workshops with two engineers, but it really enriched the experience for me. It was actually comical how different their perspectives were on mixing, the business side, motivation for the work, lifestyle, etc... This created fascinating debate / conversation in the group. The Grammy nominations were announced while we were all together and we got to celebrate Jon & Teezio as a group for their I think combined 6 or 7 nominations. They brought in a bucket of champaign. All this after having gone through the sessions for said grammy nominated work earlier in the week. 10 / 10.\n\nRue Boyer studios is actually insane. Probably the best room I've been in.\n\nThere were attendees from all over the world. We ended up sharing mixes and receiving feedback from J&T. Hearing and sharing records in the same room with the people who made them with context provided from varying countries, cultures, genres, and scenes was as enlightening a music listening experience as I'm likely to have for the rest of my life.\n\nSo if anyone else here is on the fence in the future. Here's a tiny nudge.",

He reveals the existence of the Mixer Illuminati and explains that he is but one of many people throughout history playing the role of Serban Ghenea; a mythical figure who has steered the course of art and commerce from the shadows for millenia.\n\nRome, Tenochtitlan, Mesopotamia. Serban was there. The fingerprints of past Serbans can be found throughout all major historical events - mostly just to dial back the presence of 3kHz where they can, but they were *there* nonetheless!\n\nNow you must be the next in the lineage to carry the mantle of Serban. Tomorrow you begin your Mixer Illuminati training. Where you're going Grammys don't count for shit.\n\nAlso @BatMeckley is already a member for some reason, and you're never gonna hear the end of it.",

    "content": "To piggyback on @cian riordan 's point, there are real, tangible benefits to being quiet in the back of the room. I would love to be a fly on the wall while @BatMeckley is producing a chart-topping vocalist, or see how Cian works through a first pass of a mix for his next Grammy-winning client. I guarantee they've learned a thing or two about how to talk to sensitive, demanding, highly respected artists. And they've learned how to interpret vague feedback (\"make the vocal less green\")  and working with people who can't articulate what they want. These are things you can't learn by watching Youtube videos or going to school.\n\nWhen I was an assistant at Remote Control, getting to sit in and see how Hans handles a note from Jerry Bruckheimer taught me more than years of music education. Watching my boss struggle for 6 months on a 10-minute cue and then sit in a meeting with grace and calm while he's being told to change everything he just spent many long nights working on. \n\nThat's not to mention things like learning how the real pros handle file management, deliveries, deadlines, tech problems, etc.. There is so much beyond learning the gear that comes from being a good assistant. If Matt knows you're going to shut up AND have his back with lackluster cookies, he's going to let you hang in the room longer. Which means you can absorb and learn more. It's a win-win.",

Artists wanted more takes but basically got bullied out of the room. \n2) The artist wanted to be there for the comp at least, producer refused. As I said, first time he heard it was after first mix pass. \n3) producer baked some Sonics into the vocal that were very outside for the artist, and there were bad edits & poor Melodyne work to boot. \n\n\nNow not only is the mixer gonna have to mix the vocals all over again (we\u2019re retracking,) but all the other shit I\u2019m adding/changing. \n\nSo this producer made the artist uncomfortable and then made more work for everyone, on a major label budget. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna speculate on the why, but there are some lessons here.",

Just not to me. That will be my curse. I would dutifully churn out hits as fast as I am able to and gift humanity with a tsunami of unimpeachable pop awesomeness that will endure for a century. My sacrifice would be everyone else\u2019s gain.\n\nCounter-intuitively, by saturating the market with my personal brand of songwriting it would inspire the next generation of songwriters. Unable to compete with my torrent of sure-shot pop badness they would respond by writing new music that is the direct antithesis of my own brand of hits. With a little luck, the musical output of these writers would be exactly what I wished to hear all along.\n\nThat\u2019s a win/win right there. I just have to suffer a bit. I choose *Option #1*.",

If only we had pure meritocracy here. Sam Fender put it really well this week with regards to the music industry so I won\u2019t go over stony ground, you can google his thoughts which I largely relate to.\n\nAs an individual I\u2019m horribly determined and annoyingly persistent when I have a goal in mind, as well as always balancing that with being the kindest person I can be towards others (sometimes to my detriment) and pretty much always in a headspace of bettering myself personally and professionally. This has generally been the key to many of the opportunities I\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s an English word for it, \u201cnous\u201d, which I think is similar to agency but also encompasses the notion of having \u201cgood sense\u201d. I quite like that as it\u2019s less about intelligence, and more about personal character. Just my two cents. As always firing off quick thoughts in a session break so I\u2019m sorry if my take is a bit disconnected.",

    "content": "This completely resonates with me. The business of music doesn\u2019t sit as well with me as the business of construction. There\u2019s a camaraderie and kinship in physical labour on construction projects, and an embodied intelligence in that world that offsets the subjective and (for me) atomised work of hours alone mixing.\n\nWhen I\u2019m doing construction work, I\u2019m also free to think objectively and from a distance about my audio engineering work.\n\nMost of all, something changes for me when I\u2019m being paid for musical \u201cwork\u201d that I\u2019m not entirely happy with. I\u2019ve discussed this privately with a few folks here, and it seems the relationship between music and its commodification is problematic for more than a few of us. Simply put, it\u2019s sometimes less enjoyable \u2014 though equally amazing \u2014 being paid for a passion.\n\nI couldn\u2019t recommend a construction or skilled trade career enough. It\u2019s incredibly flexible and offers a tonic to music careers: you know you can walk onto a site tomorrow and get paid quickly and well. It\u2019s always going to be around, and in my case, the certifications allow me to consider migrating to most economies globally as a skilled worker.\n\nConstruction allows me to be my own patron for my musical endeavours, and that feels really good.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a bigger debate here about how working in the upper echelons of the music industry feels long term \u2014 challenges, payoffs, economics, job security, retirement, healthcare, family life versus work life, and a world where socialising is networking.\n\nConstruction is a simpler engagement: competency, find a solution, do the work, go home.\n\nI came across @cian riordan discussing becoming a fireman on Conversations, and much of what you said, Cian, is exactly what I get from construction.\n\nI love how for you, though \u2014 instead of the firehouse bell calling, it was multiple Grammys!",

It took me about a year to pull in enough income from mixing and spotify streams where I could stop living off savings and only on music income. \n\nBut, It IS so expensive to live here, and I like to do things. typical night out is like $80 after drinks and ubers. Gas is $80. An egg sandwich is $16 lol. The constant worrying of if i was going to make enough that month got to me, so of a couple months ago, I returned to a freelance software engineering gig 3 days a week. Never been happier. A _lot_ of people in LA are doing the same: _side hustles are your friend_ . \n\nAnother thing i'd add is when you first move here, try to combine your studio and living expenses. Studio spots here start at like $1800 a month and go up from there. I live in a beautiful house in silverlake with roommates where I have a room, my own bathroom, _and my own studio_ in the furnished garage for $1300. Try to get something like that.",

High profile audio publications will begin calling for interviews. Cian will be pressured to accept. The LWMR server crew decides that he should do this one interview but only under condition that he be allowed to distort his voice and image.\n\n@cian riordan shows up. Sporting an outrageous mustache and atrocious accent he completes the interview. Miraculously it works. People love him. The mix requests start coming in. Collectively, the server decides to push our luck a little further than we ought to.\n\nThe influx of mix requests are more than Cian can complete himself, so they start getting passed off to server members to mix. The money is flowing. Serban's album credits for 2022 shoot through the roof. The perks start going to everyone's head.\n\nFinally, in 2023 while Cian (replete with mustache) is accepting his Grammy for *Record of the Year* (the real) Serban comes out of seclusion and shows up at the ceremony, demanding to know \"What is the meaning of all this?\"\n\n...then we've all got some 'splainin to do.",

Then they're losers by their own competitive standard, and losing is all part of the game.\n\nEveryone else can only stand to gain by being nominated. The act of being nominated is a reward in it's own right. It's a net positive and validating moment for anybody's career. While it may be disappointing not to win, hopefully they'll never feel that they're losers for failing to win something that they didn't ask for.\n\nThis is all to say that it's a matter of mindset. If you're not actively trying to win a Grammy, then a loss shouldn't be construed as some demeaning thing and the nomination is still a net positive. I don't think it's on the Grammys to regulate people's emotional state.",

Every remote gig is different and I realize this situation is a lot of luck and circumstance. Don\u2019t be discouraged to take another gig. I was able to pay off high interest cards and can comfortably afford gear when I want it. I was full time in the studio from age 14-31 no other job. It was a transition, but one I\u2019m glad I made. I\u2019m still working mixing full time as well. I do production if I\u2019m stoked on the project. I work with rock bands for context. Just do dope work try not to compare. Remember there are some people with mountains of gear and dope setups they own. much respect to that. Others have rich parents, high interest credit debt, or both. I told myself if I wasn\u2019t rolling in it with a Grammy at 30 I would stop which is a super dumb mindset. I love making records more than anything and getting another gig allows me to keep doing it. Rant over best of luck to everyone \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd",

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

    "content": "Let's think about this from an activism point of view - are you actually trying to affect change, or is this personal? In the case of MWTM, if you write to them and say \"Hey, I disagree with this and will be cancelling my subscription,\" they might notice. If 500 users do it, they certainly will. If they lose 5000 subscribers, maybe they'd rethink it.\n\nIf their user base isn't passionate about the issue, MWTM doesn't have any financial incentive to change what they're doing. Spotify and the other streamers have Chris Brown, and I can't imagine the amount of pushback they would need before pulling his catalog from their services.\n\nAs Noah said, everyone can vote with their wallet and decide where to focus their attention on a personal level.",

First of all, great record / artist. I checked out his Spotify and saw that he had no music out before this album. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but my understanding is that he got some tik tok traction then went on the road with Zach Bryan before any of his stuff was out? Was so stoked to see the amount of excitement around an artist\u2019s first release (which is so sick that his first release was an album as well). This might be a hot take, but I think I\u2019m a pretty big fan of the way tik tok has impacted music discovery. Obviously it\u2019s not perfect or going to satisfy everyone, but it\u2019s pretty awesome that all the doors are wide open. And I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a bigger interest in songs, writing, lyrics, etc. From what I\u2019ve heard, it sounds like people got to know some of these Joshua Slone songs well enough to be singing along at his live shows, and I would dare to attribute that to the fact that his lyrics are literally on the screen in his videos. Who knows, maybe that\u2019s all bull shit lol, but wanted to throw it out there. Would love to hear y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts.",

Making a career in the music industry is what engineers would call a \"wicked\" problem. It's not something that has a repeatable solution, and what works for someone rarely works the same way for the next person.\n\nThat said, I see that you\u2019re from Boston. I lived there for seven years, and the talent pool in that city is tremendous. I think if you found yourself back home in Boston it would be a worthwhile investment to integrate yourself into the scene of young musicians that are centered around the schools in the Back Bay like Berklee, NEC, and Boston Conservatory. There are some immensely talented, diverse, and creative people from all around the world based at those institutions and they all exist within 8 blocks of each other. It\u2019s rare to have such a concentration of driven musicians all mingling amongst each other. This is a massive resource that you can tap into. They're *all* trying to make something great and explore what's possible.\n\nIt's a unique opportunity to discover collaborators, build relationships, earn experience in your craft, and build strong connections for the future as you grow alongside these people. On top of that, Boston has numerous recording studios where you can intern and assist. There\u2019s a lot of experience to be gained working in a studio that simply won\u2019t be taught to you in a recording program. Supplement that practical experience with hard work, and some book learning and you can do very well for yourself.\n\nThere\u2019s more that I\u2019m not touching-on, but I think if you ended up back in Boston it not be as much as a trade-off as you may think.",

I think unlimited music is certainly worth that. Setting aside, for the moment, all of the other complexities around market pricing, we also need to remember that Spotify's largest streaming competitors are Apple and Amazon.\n\nThese are companies with massive war-chests derived from the success of their non-streaming companies. Even if Spotify *wanted* to raise the cost of their service, companies like Apple and Amazon can afford to keep the price of streaming services depressed and sustain a loss on their streaming services for far longer than Spotify ever could. To my eyes, Spotify doesn't have a whole lot of wiggle-room to adjust their pricing and therefore their payout models.\n\nI say as much, because in casual discussions around streaming payouts, there doesn't seem to be much awareness of the larger business ecosystem that a company like Spotify finds itself in.",

    "content": "Wellllll, as the person who asked the opening question , re: marketing and perceived value, it did seem to open up a broad discussion with a lot of varied input . Wherever it got into any perceived sense of entitlement , was off track as the core of the question was about leveraging and better pay/benefits for the successful elite (nothing to do with people striving to get there ) . It wasn\u2019t a question about working hard.....or having talent......or how to share a pie and how much pie there is ......that\u2019s all a given in the original discussion I referenced that was between two Grammy winning engineers.  It was a discussion about marketing and the idea of engineers  leveraging for more as a community looking forwards . One  platform was mentioned here earlier that I have experience with.......and they are definitely driving value down with their marketing.  Through the history of time workers have had to fight for more (pay/benefits/better working conditions / contracts ) and imho that\u2019s a legitimate and beneficial force in society. Noam Chomsky describes a point at which society collapses is when the imbalance of the societal structure is such that the vast majority of the workforce can no longer afford to live . In the uk we are currently experiencing strikes across many services/industries. It\u2019s not really my way to say if they are write or wrong ......but I think the concept of unionising and leveraging for \u201cfairer/better :::::whatever you like \u201c is legitimate not entitled or moany  . The suffragettes did it ......I digress. I think IME it\u2019s a fair observation that people employed on the business side of the music business in the big music companies in the  uk work with the expectation that this will result in take home regular pay, without fear of non-payment , working with full benefits re\u2019 holiday pay , maternity pay , etc etc.......",

They did indeed do that, and I don\u2019t think it will go back. \n\nIt was decentralization they were after. the record industry was already beyond rescue (to go back to its heyday) so they wanted a better piratesbay where people can hear the music right away, and not the messed up mp3 that has been converted to different codecs multiple times. The platforms opening up to everybody is why someone like myself or my clients can upload any kind of music. \n\nI mention all of this to say\u2026 I think that\u2019s what they wanted. But I think they were hoping more people would use the free version so they can juice more profit out of the ads. I don\u2019t think they were expecting this many people to go premium, which lowers the value of each ads\u2026 (because they won\u2019t be listened to as much)",

But I don't think it matters quite so much.\n\nIf you want to get all game theory about it, there are other competing labels with voting members and artists of their own who are *also* pushing to attain a Grammy, come voting season. So I think your thesis that a label might try to increase their odds of winning by directing their employees to vote for *their* artist is counter-balanced somewhat by their label competitors probably doing the same.\n\nThe net result in this scenario would be that the gap between major-labels winning and indie artists winning is widened.",

MB is asking for 'asset id's' for his back catalogue which he doesn't know / doesn't have. From what he told me seems 'asset id's' have something to do with collecting youtube royalties. My question is what is an asset id and where do you find it?\n\nMy friend released one EP through Tonetree and those tracks do have an asset id but his back catalogue was through Tunecore. MB suggested he switch his entire back catalogue over to Tonetree just to get asset id's for those tracks which frankly seems pretty dumb to me. Anyone familiar with this?",

Each neighborhoods have profit making restaurants. But when it comes to music industry, the proportion of those who actually make money is way low compared to restaurant business. In restaurant business, you still pay the workers regardless. You have to. In music, if the artist isn\u2019t making money then the ones who get hired by artists have no chance of making money",

In case anyone is interested there's a book that @shaunobi shared about previously here called '*Chokepoint Capitalism*' that I believe provides an interesting context for some of the topics / ideas from this convo. I'm about halfway through it myself.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk here about there not being enough money entering into the top of the music industry, but far less talk about how little of the money that does flows towards the artists and producers of the art that drives the industry and culture.\n\nThe book makes a pretty compelling case that copyright law, antitrust law / enforcement (or lack thereof), regulatory capture, the consolidation of power in the music industry and formation of monopolies / monopsonies with anticompetitive flywheels has greatly contributed to the reality or perception by some that the average creative worker in this industry is getting less in return for the actual value they are putting in. I'm still sifting through it but do think it's worth a read / would make for an interesting addition to the discussion.",

I haven't looked at Shopify's print on demand pricing, but in general POD is much higher cost than bulk screen printing t-shirts (for example). So if you're a band selling at the scale where $40/mo. on a slow month isn't your *entire* profit margin, it seems like investing in a run of merch would pay for itself.\n\nNow this is completely different if you look at it from the perspective of a clothing brand, where the goal is to have a diversity of designs available at all times, without the need for warehousing and a huge startup cost, and to consistently push sales to a customer base that's devoted to *the merch*. I can't imagine the vast majority of DistroKid artists are going that hard on ecommerce, but they could sure benefit from having their POD merch visible on their Spotify profile. The small artists I work with would probably be better off putting $40 into Instagram ads every month.",

Their rationale seems to be that labels and other potential team members (booking agents, managers, etc...) want to hop on the fresh new promising HOT artist stonk :stonks:  rather than work with an artist who has been consistently releasing music for years but whose catalogue on streaming platforms is dominated or overrepresented by older works. That they are turned off by middling success after many attempts over time.\n\nWould a truly amazing *undeniable* record have a better shot at commercial success under a new artist name with no previous middling successful tracks or nah? At what point, if ever, would it be beneficial for an artist to kill an artist project and start fresh under a new name with new music?",

The caveat is that singles are released once a month for streaming (full thing on streaming platforms at the end of the year, so the example had 12 singles).  After seeing some good discussion about the idea, I'm curious as to what y'all think about it? \n\nThe main points I've heard in favor of the move:\n- 1 person buying the album for 10 bucks cancels out so many no's\n- Prioritizes real fans over casual listeners\n- Incentivizes an artist to make the album, because it's batching content for a year. \n- Forces the artist to view music as a business, but doesn't fully leave the Spotify ecosystem.",

Yesterday I watched rob marksman (mtv news/hip hop journalist ) talking about digital not being permanent and we are at risk of breaking a chain of music histories being passed down in physical formats to generations to come due to streaming . If streaming companies fold in the future , no one would have any music magazines , videos , let alone singles / albums . It made me think of what Steve albini was saying . So at major labels \u2026.are all the master recordings now digital files on a disk somewhere ?",

I think mostly because the initial investment is much lower (think $25-$50k annually instead of hundreds of thousand to record & market albums, tour support, etc.)",

I\u2019m with you . \n\nI think what I\u2019m wondering about is \u2026..with our modern lifestyles I totally get how the consumer is listening mostly by headphones now . And we as music makers are freed up enormously by working in headphones . I think rod waves album got a Grammy and was mixed on headphones iirc, perhaps it was a number 1 . Anyhoo , so I\u2019m not contesting the movement to headphone mixing , I\u2019m wondering for those who intend to or are doing all their work on headphones \u2026..how will you know how it feels in air ? As one day , the artist will perform it live . I come from club and sound system culture , so the ultimate destination is a wall of speaker boxes \u2026..and in the end music has to be re inforced for public performance . How do we know we ve got that balance right if we don\u2019t use speakers ? (Honest question )",

'Producer' is shown but no field for 'additional production'.\n\nI agree with what others were alluding to in that it's worth considering how asking for revised credits impacts the relationship and that caution and being respectful towards and honoring the artist's story is valuable.",

    "content": "I was recently inspired after going to the cinema to see *A Complete Unkown*, the movie memoir about Bob Dylan; partially by Bob's story, but also by Timothy Chalomee's performance as Bob. All of the shots of him performing in the movie were fully live - which is an impressive feat by itself - but even more impressive that he apparently wasn't much of a musician before making the movie. I didnt know much about Timothy before this, so I watched his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's YouTube channel. One thing I found really interesting was how available he made himself to learning the role. For example, he didn't turn his phone on for 3 months straight. Got me thinking about how much I can get distracted during the day, and how these distractions can get in the way of me actually giving 100% to the art that I'm working on. I'm sure you all can imagine how the distractions in your own life can effect your work. Might be TikTok videos, might be discord, might be lusting over getting new converters or monitors or guitars, etc, you get the idea. So I guess what I'm saying here is that if I want to compete with the best, maybe I have to understand how to impliment systems in my life that allows me to be more available to the things that I am working on. I want it to be like lifiting a heavy weight at the gym - at the bottom of a heavy squat, you've no choice but to focus on pushing the bar back up with good form, cos that think will break you otherwise. There's a certain thing that happens in your brain when you're forced to only think about one thing for a prolonged, or even short period. It's something akin to meditating. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is if anyone has ever given this subject any thought before, and if anyone has ever done anything to get better at these things? I'm still not sure if all this only makes sense inside my own head.",

That pedophilia is immoral and an act of depravity that has next to no equal on earth. Think of the furvor around Jerry Epstien, and other notable cases. Lots of people feel this passionately. And find a chorus of agreement of the stance. So a song that plays on that particular emotive center. And finding traction with a large group of people makes sense to me in that regard",

    "content": "I think there\u2019s a danger in assuming those that are successful didn\u2019t have it hard.\n2 quick stories that have shaped my career:\n\nvery early on when I was recruited to play in a band in Australia. Sold my car, got rid of my apartment, and flew out to Melbourne. Band had a moment but I got tossed out just as the song was going number 1. Had no money to get home, no where to stay, and was literally 23 living on our producers couch in a country about as far from home as possible. And I called my pop, basically telling him how bummed/scared/fucked I was. And he goes \u201cyou know, I just got off the phone with **** (a very famous actor friend of ours). If there\u2019s anyone that had it all, you\u2019d think it was him. Big career, wife on the cover of sports illustrated swimsuit edition, fans everywhere. But it turns out his Dad just passed, his wife is cheating on him, and if this new show doesn\u2019t get picked up they might lose the house they just bought. EVERYONE has their share of crap they have to deal with, give or take, no matter how easy it looks from the outside. Life isn\u2019t about what happens to you, it\u2019s about how you deal with what happens to you. Figure out a way to make the most of what\u2019s going on\u201d. For some reason, knowing that EVERYONE\u2019s life sucks to some degree, was immensely helpful in getting me back on my feet.\n\nThe other was a year or two later, when I started tuning vocals for Rob Cavallo. One of his wrecking crew of session musicians had been in a band with a huge hero of mine, who had sadly took his own life mid way through making his second record.

Whatever instrument you played he was better at it than you were within 10 minutes of picking it up. But he seemed to think he was the only guy that ever got a raw deal from the music industry\u201d.",

It seems like streaming is about as easy as it\u2019s going to get, and I don\u2019t really hear any Spotify users with qualms about their experience.\n\nI do wonder if artists will become less partial to Spotify over time though. It seems like there are so many different metrics of success now (Spotify streams, instagram followers, tik tok followers are the main ones I think of) that aren\u2019t always mutually inclusive of each other. And I wonder if that takes a little weight off of streaming numbers being the only metric that legitimizes an artist. And I hear people like Ryan Tedder talk about the importance of \u201cworld building\u201d for artists now - I wonder if fans of artists will care more about being part of that artist\u2019s ecosystem than the artist\u2019s music being a part of their music library. I think of how K Pop bands sell crazy numbers of physical copies as an example. They can still stream the music but it seems like there are more variables now.\n\nThinking out loud a little bit, I might have just said absolutely nothing with a lot of words lol.",

Been listening back to a project I did that came out end of last year and, after A/Bing the songs with the master files, I\u2019m pretty positive something is going on. The artist double checked the files and they\u2019re all the right ones. Only thing I can think of is they switched from distrokid to a different company mid project rollout. Not sure how that would affect things.\n\nThe sound is just kinda phasey, almost \u201cbubbly.\u201d Kinda like if someone threw a bunch of waves NS1 all over the session (which I didn\u2019t lol). Kinda driving me a little crazy.\n\nEdit: Got confirmation from the artist and ME that it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s only on the singles she uploaded to distrokid before switching to the smaller distro, so she\u2019s reaching out to them. Beware the distro switch.",
