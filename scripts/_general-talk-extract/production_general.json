    "content": "So, early in working with Cavallo we we\u2019re doing a project at Skywalker Ranch in Nor Cal, living there for about 6 weeks. And he would unwind by cooking the staff these huge dinners in the industrial kitchen and then when they all retired for the night he would crack a bottle of wine and just talk shop with me for an hour or two. One night we\u2019re talking about mixers, and I mentioned doing a project with another producer where one of the big big big name mixers had tanked the record. And he said \u201cwell whose fault is that?\u201d And I responded the mixers obviously, it was awesome when we sent it to him. And he said \u201cno, with all due respect, it\u2019s the producer\u2019s job. I sent back *grammy winning record here* 12 times to that mixer because the mix was just not quite right. As a producer your only job at the end of the day is \u2018can i stand behind this record, is this the best the artist could possibly put out. Does it rule\u2019. THAT is the job of a producer. A guy like Fields might get there by re playing all the instruments when the band leaves. A guy like Rubin might give them a reading assignment. They\u2019re both equally producers because at the end of the day their records are consistently quality, however they get there. THAT is the job. The rest is just details\u201d\n\nThe people that know how will always work for the people that know why. \n\nThat lesson was invaluable to me.",

I crushed it on a deadline, then that same A&R hired me a year later to work on a band called Emblem 3 who was on X Factor US as well. I crushed that and then six months after that he recommended me to a UK A&R who was having trouble finishing a song for One Direction. I did a spec production on the song Best Song Ever and they liked it and used it and all of a sudden I become a big pop producer.

    "content": "God I love this discord. \nTo me 90% of the reason big producers are paying many thousands a day to be in a studio the past 15-20 years is to just not have to worry about shit. Anyone can make a record at home these days; part of being in an \u201cactual\u201d studio is the cocoon of creativity. If the assistant takes more than a couple of minutes to patch anything in, bring up the piano, or recommend the best Thai place in town, they\u2019re blowing it. I had an assistant once at this place famous for making cookies on site, bring me my normal plate of cookies I always ask for and while I was comping I ate half of one, put it back on the plate, and continued working. He didn\u2019t say a word, got up, grabbed the plate, and disappeared for a few minutes and came back. \u201cHey man, I know you normally house the entire plate of cookies so when you put that one back I checked with the kitchen and last week I guess they changed the cookie recipe, and they\u2019re gonna make em like they used to for you.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I asked for that dude every session after, less for the cookies but more for the insane attention to detail and telepathy. One of max\u2019s engineers started as a Conway assistant, and as good of an engineer as he was he also prepped the best Hookahs and was just a great hang. Max ended up hiring him for his own studio. We\u2019re in a people business, try to be attentive and a good person to have around, for all the reasons that go beyond knowing how to set an attack on an 1176. \n\nThe flip side is, if you\u2019re booking a studio as a producer, the assistants are what really make the studio run. Treat them well. Know their names. Give them credit. No assistant on any session I ever did paid for their own meal, they got what the artist got.  They most of the time got engineer credits. Help them along. As with all things, mutual respect goes a long way.",

    "content": "Re; Brauer workshop\n\n-First 2 days were nothing technical, the 1st conversation he brought up was about TM and how meditation in general has helped him.\n-Everything is feel-based, most technical Q's for the first 2 and a half days got the same reply: \"It doesn't matter to me, i don't care what the thing is long as it feels good\". \n-MHB actually seems to leave the planet while he's mixing, it's wild how immediate he gets into that space. Seemed to go way past \"i love mixing and here's all the reasons i'm the shit\" and it was inspiring to see the ego leave the equation. His decades of experience are playing directly into his ability to access the story of the song and present it in a compelling, live-feeling way. He mixes from inside the song and performs. Well, he does discovery, then shapes the sounds, then performs just about everything on faders.\n-The biggest wake up call to me is that a lot of moves i've made on mixes did not have a good reason behind them. So continuing to ask \"why\" as I work is gonna be important, because I have to start catching myself and adjusting when the answer to \"why\" is \"because someone said this preset is cool\" or \"because this is what I do to a vocal/guitar/drums\". I feel music very deeply, it's why i got into this, but I feel like i've been poisoned against trusting that instinct and convinced that what we do is a technical job. I'm done being an observer of the art, i want to be bold.\n-It's critical to build trust with clients right away, you can't assume anything in what they understand about how you feel. Telling them you love the song and you're excited to mix it is important, and never blaming production/artist/anything else for the mix being less than what it should be. never okay to say \"i did my best\", because that gives you an out and implies somebody else could do it better\n-Therefore, you must believe when you sit down to mix that nobody is gonna interpret this song better than you.\n-Generally i'm skeptical to just take on someone else's \"method\" and start operating in that space just becuase of the success they've had with it. Putting this week into practice is going to mean using his template to get reps in, listening and feeling and interacting in a new way and letting my brain \"level up\", if you will, then zooming out and making it my own.\n\n\nI can distill this more and want to share about a couple other specifics, but I just realized I grabbed someone else's notebook by mistake when I left on the last day so I'll need to have them mail mine back to me.",

    "content": "sort of related, but i've been reflecting a lot on how precious it is to maintain a listener's perspective on a work in progress, and what things we can be doing as the producer/mixer/etc to grant that privilege to the artist first and foremost. the simple stuff includes saving the nitty gritty work for your own time, delivering the best mix of the record no matter the stage it's in, focusing any time spent together on how you can make their voice and contributions and ideas the best they can be. some artists love mixing and editing and getting into the weeds, but i'm realizing quite often how much of a duty it is to be the artist, and how record making is only a single slice of that pie. For us it is more or less the whole pie. and a big responsibility we carry (perhaps without realizing?) is that it is our job to protect the artist from getting  stressed out by the process. and this extends to processing and managing our own stress about the work should it exist, as stress is a contagious energy.",

    "content": "Ok Tl;dr- where you are matters as much as who you are. \n\nI\u2019m also from a small town, moved to LA trying to get famous and got my ass handed to me by artists who were better looking & more talented and yet were still struggling to be seen. But I kept at it because I\u2019m tenacious, (read: delusional, as all artists must be.)\n\nI was able to work *for* some of those artists cause I had a diverse skillset, and I was full time music after about 4 years, by the time I was 26. Doing gigs at hotels and playing guitar or recording for other people, teaching guitar, leading music at churches, all the while pouring evening last ounce of money & energy into my artist career, until my last real artist project broke up the week we were supposed to sign our first record deal. I was 36. \n\nThat\u2019s when I moved to Nashville and really gave myself over to music directing and producing and writing for other artists. I did it as a consolation while I regrouped to find my next thing, but for some reason, when I made the move all the sudden my whole career made sense to me. \n\nAs it turns out, my real joy comes not from the sound of my own voice, but from helping others find theirs. When I acquiesced to that very real, very culturally counterintuitive calling, I thrived. \n\nAll the sudden I was playing music with and for a bunch of my heroes, and all my friends who were artists starting getting famous. And (shocker) I was really glad I wasn\u2019t one of them. \n\nI always thought that my calling was to help people feel less alone in the world, and that the music I made was the vehicle for that calling. In the end, it turns out it was the relationships i built through music that were the real vehicle.  \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out who I was, and the cities I was in played a huge role in that story. Nashville built its whole industry on people who want to *help* artists, not just *be* artists. \n\nI miss LA every day but I\u2019m in the right place. So, my friend, where is the right place for you?",

We\u2019re actually better for having worked on things that we\u2019d never share willingly.\nIs this really a reason to bail? I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t. But aesthetics are really subjective. Are you saying your finger\u2019s on the pulse of your generation\u2019s aesthetic taste? Is there room for differences? Also, it sounds like your friend wrote the songs and is the frontman, and you are producing, playing bass, and mixing. Why are you so attached to the visual aspect of it when your role is more support rather than the face of the project?",

As somebody with a science background myself, my issue with Jon's claim is that its not rooted in any sort of methodical process. And now kids on the internet get fueled with the idea that one DAW might sound better than another -- instead of focusing on things that make far more of a difference in their productions/mixes/masters/etc.\n\nEDIT: I Have no doubt that if the same person mixed the same song in two different DAWs that they\u2019d come to very different results. But that\u2019s all inherent to the workflow, not to the physics or limitations of that particular DAW.",

It all seems very rudimentary now, but I was starting from literally nothing in a place with few (if any?) visible role models.\n\nI learned so much from it on a technical level - from basic stuff like what a Pultec is and how people use it (connecting the dots between my cracked Waves bundle - Puigtec and who tf JJP was), what \u201ca vocal chain\u201d might look like and the purpose of each stage\u2026\n\nTrue, the interviews did become unbearable, but there was a golden era between eps around 30-90 at a time when outside of working in the studio world, there weren\u2019t many other sources of good information from people who were really doing it.\n\nHuge appreciation for Dave, and I hope he and his family get the support they need.",

Songs spread out between multiple project files, DAWs, laptops\u2026vocals tracked to mp3s with the ~50ms delay thing\u2026Some of these producers templates\u2026brilliant stuff. Saw one vocal travel through maybe 7 or 8 auxes and hit probably 4 different rvox\u2019s along the way. It was like a labyrinth of signal flow that was nearly impossible to follow (and once I deleted half the auxes and waves plugins, it started to come back to life). In short they\u2019re having me un-mix it, hand it back for some more production, then do the final mixes later this year. A true testament to the importance of organization and more importantly minimalist, straight forward session files. I wonder how often this need comes up and how feasible it is to be involved ahead of the handoff as a mixer these days. And before you frown at me for griping, this is an absolutely incredible project, many insanely talented musicians I respect. Very right brained, free flowing group. So it felt cool to be able to play more of a part on the project as the more left brained participant and see the stress relief happen in real time.",

Often these \u201ctaste mismatch\u201d issues come across to me as missing that essence within the thing you\u2019re working on and trying to make it something that it essentially isn\u2019t. ie. A wannabe Max Martin working with a wannabe mitski and the producer complaining that the artist\u2019s suggestions are making the production hashy and the artist complaining that the producer\u2019s production choices don\u2019t convey enough emotion. \n\nIt\u2019s talking past each-other and not really collaborating.

They get my running commentary on what techniques I\u2019m doing. They get the inside baseball\u2026 \u201cI wish they fired this fucking drummer\u201d. \n\nI agree with Ruairi that this type of coming up through the ranks is a loss for up and comers. It was tried and true way to make people understand the ins and outs of studio technique, etiquette, professionalism. I\u2019m glad I got to ride one of the last waves of it.

I would love to be a fly on the wall while @BatMeckley is producing a chart-topping vocalist, or see how Cian works through a first pass of a mix for his next Grammy-winning client. I guarantee they've learned a thing or two about how to talk to sensitive, demanding, highly respected artists. And they've learned how to interpret vague feedback (\"make the vocal less green\")  and working with people who can't articulate what they want. These are things you can't learn by watching Youtube videos or going to school.\n\nWhen I was an assistant at Remote Control, getting to sit in and see how Hans handles a note from Jerry Bruckheimer taught me more than years of music education. Watching my boss struggle for 6 months on a 10-minute cue and then sit in a meeting with grace and calm while he's being told to change everything he just spent many long nights working on. \n\nThat's not to mention things like learning how the real pros handle file management, deliveries, deadlines, tech problems, etc.. There is so much beyond learning the gear that comes from being a good assistant. If Matt knows you're going to shut up AND have his back with lackluster cookies, he's going to let you hang in the room longer. Which means you can absorb and learn more. It's a win-win.",

Let\u2019s set the time horizon to 25 years and acknowledge the seemingly increasing pace of change in the world\n\nOk, the sliders \u2026\n\n**#1 Classics vs Cutting Edge**\nOn this slider 0 represents maximum knowledge in a classical sense - literature, math, mythology, fundamental accepted basics in Biology/Chemistry/Physics etc etc. 10 represents complete literacy in the cutting edge of culture, science and technology - from memes and Reddit culture to AI to synthetic biology and Blockchain etc etc \n\n**#2 Specialist vs Generalist**\nHere 0 represents a very deep and specific knowledge of a chosen field (could be a doctor or a producer) vs 10 representing a modern Jack of all trades who knows a little bit about a lot of things \n\n**#3 Short Term vs Long Term**\nOn the slider 0 represents a disposition all about short term wins, fast plays that close out over a year vs 10 representing long investments in a given idea/field/belief system\n\nIt goes without saying that the zero sum aspect here is artificial, you can of course have some long term plays happening alongside some short term, but it\u2019s just to get the juices flowing",

Grab the trunk of junk and start laying out potential options. Once I started actually being useful, I\u2019d be given real tasks. \u201cHey, do you think you could try doing a preliminary comp of this vocal?\u201d I had been in the room for all the vocal takes, heard the discussion about approach and vibe, even made the singers coffee the right way\u2026 why not? That evolved into being trusted with recording stuff in the second studio\u2026 we were always running behind, and having me chip away at guitar tracking or re-amping was really useful. Years of this and we were a well oiled machine. I\u2019d get looped into pre-production phone calls and meetings, he would start asking my opinion on things.. drum sounds, microphone choices.",

    "content": "I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner, but the closest parallel to the seismic shift of AI might be samples, even more so than things like digital recording or Pro Tools. When Hans Zimmer recorded an orchestra and started writing music with a DAW and showing clients mockups, nothing was ever the same. For a long time (even now!) the pencil-and-paper people griped about how it wasn't real composition. Orchestras feared that they would all be replaced by computers. But ultimately, everyone had to come to terms with the new world order and adapt. There was a period in the mid-90s through mid-late 2000s where orchestral writing was reduced to nothing more than long notes and short notes. All of the nuance was gone, because the tech couldn't handle it yet and people blamed the tech. Many mourned the loss of true orchestral writing, yearning for a by-gone era. \n\nBut eventually, people learned to harness these new tools and they met the technology on its own terms. People are doing wildly innovative things with samples now, we've moved completely past the era of \"can I make a convincing clarinet come out of my keyboard?\" Orchestras and live musicians have not been replaced. Sure, the process is different than it used to be, but that's how innovations work. All of us would be living very different lives without samples of drums, guitars, orchestras, synths, etc. There will be a generation coming up where AI is already a thing, they won't have ever lived in the before-times. Just like those here who've never cut to tape. It's okay.",

Everybody tells me the producer/band leader is this prolific asshole, constantly blowing up at people and impossible to please. The previous mixer had been mixing this thing for months/over a year and everyone was worn out/not getting results. I was really reluctant to take on the project for fear of being intimidated/failing to deliver.\n\nI've made a point of greeting the producer at every step with clear communication, enthusiasm, and an open mind. I genuinely love the music and have made a point of letting him know how much fun it's been to work on the stuff. And, similar to your story, we were basically approved on the first track within 4 mixes and the guy seemed really really happy.\n\nEveryone just said this guy was a hopeless asshole, but what I saw was a guy who was working so hard to bring a vision to life and just struggling to get there; self-financing, overseeing everything, etc... and it's fairly complex, hip hop and soul vibes with practically a full orchestra and 3 vocalists, so it's a lot to manage. Not trying to excuse the asshole behavior, but I see the frustration and I really wanted to highlight how much cool work he had done and that, without any fuss or needless back and forth, we would just get it where it needed to go. i tried to just think about how exciting it could be to finally hear these songs that've been bouncing around in his head actually come out of the speaker the way he imagined. We've got 7 songs almost done now and I've grown so much just from these attitude alignments i've picked up from spending time here.",

This role is changing, and we'd all be smart to understand where it's headed.\n\nI get hired to finish songs a lot. Usually that means I have a \"co-producer\" credit. Sometimes it means \"mixer\" credit. Occasionally it's included \"mastering.\" But really what I'm hired for is that combination of experience and technical knowledge. I'm an outside ear who knows how to fix what's missing. This role of \"finisher\" is really where a lot of the producer/ mixer/ mastering engineer profession is headed. The distinction between those roles is getting blurrier. \n\nMixing engineers have moved from pulling up faders on the console and creating a mix (old school \"mixers\") to often just pulling up the rough mix of stems and making finishing touches (Jon, Manny, Serban, Tony, Bainz, etc.).\n\nIn this way, the \"mixing engineer\" profession is moving away from manipulating raw sounds to manipulating nearly finished mixes. This is sounding more and more like what a \"mastering engineer\" does. Now there's \"stem mixing\" and \"stem mastering\" too, further blurring the lines. These are all just slightly different configurations of the same thing. Who do you hire to get perspective and then act on it?\n\nThose of us that are finishers or mixers or mastering engineers or whatever would be smart to think about how to adapt to the direction this is all headed. \n\nI want us all to win. I think we need to step back and expand how we think about the roles. It's the best way for us all to have careers.",

Watching him figure out in real time what the song\u2019s about, what it needs, and executing it all while the track is playing is an absolute masterclass in understanding music. Dude just gets it. Structure. Tone. Makes it look effortless. Whether you\u2019re a player or a producer, that kind of understanding really pays dividends.",

But I had my first 3-4 things that started getting attention get taken away from me by managers/ labels/ bigger producers/ bigger mixers. Once I got to that next level it was obvious why I wasn't the guy yet. But if you're working on things that are at some point getting out there in a real way, that's the place that most people are before they jump up. \n\nSome of it is opportunity, some of it is skillset, some of it is time management (if you're hustling, it helps to turn great shit around before everyone else), and some of it is just the intangibles that come from more reps. \n\nMy One Direction song came out 17 years after I first recorded the first band I was in.

    "content": "i think the premise of this stems from the constant fight that i feel like we all face....wanting something to be the \"best\" it can be (at least in our personal minds and perspectives) vs the sometimes reality that we are hired to do a \"job\" and not everything is going to meet our expectations of what we personally think is great, because at the end of the day, we aren't the artist...or in some cases, even the intended audience. with that said...if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. / might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it...so who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. this is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world...but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

You work on 15+ songs a day as an ME, you hear aberrant clicks and pops in *nearly every single one of them* \n\nWith asking the person who sent you the files to do it, you spend your whole day emailing and managing files. It takes longer to open gmail than it does to zap the click. \n\nAnd think of the logical conclusion of asking the mixing engineer to fix the edit. They don\u2019t have the edit, they have the comp. So then if you extend the logic they have to hit up the producer, and MAYBE the producer has to hit up the recording engineer if you really wanna \u201cget to the source\u201d. It\u2019s like the meme of the producer who didn\u2019t want to use splice because it was cheating and ended up farming sheep to get skin to make his own drumheads. Just do the fucking work. There\u2019s no time to email back and forth about things that can be fixed immediately",

They moved from the city to central massachusetts and while the songs and mixes are about 80% done, they can't get above water time and travel wise to finish the project and its put on hold for next year. This is a big record for me as a producer and musician, and it sucks that I put so much time and effort into it but in the end, I hope waiting it out  and getting back to refocus in 2026 will be worth it. On the other hand, I get hired by a band, they are super intense and ambitious about recording, mixing, and releasing - the album comes out and they breakup in 3 months or theres a lineup change where the new drummer has a home studio and can record everything there and mix it then 6 months later I get a IG dm to bail them out becuase the drummer fucked the guitarists wife and the bass player and vocalist are just going to finish the record on their own with me.",

    "content": "Sonic consistency amongst songs on a record is one of those things that gets harder as you move further through the production processes. In an ideal world, you'd map out an aesthetic for a record in pre-production and make choices in recording & production to try and stay within those lines, whatever that means. A real world example I have is when I was doing the last Mini Mansions album, we locked onto a few H3000 patches that sort of defined how the drums and ambience would sound throughout the record. We obviously didn't use it on everything, but it helped thread the needle through a wildly diverse batch of songs. After that, having one person mix the whole album will undoubtedly help tie together a record that's been all over the map in production -- be it different styles or producers. As someone that often is tasked with doing this, I am always referencing other songs in the album to try and make sure things are sounding 'consistent'. By the time mastering comes, everything should sound 99% complete.",

Maybe I need to live with them for longer and get used to it.\n\nLast week was the first time that I was able to sit in front of an Atmos setup that was meant for music (aka: not in a movie theater) and really get the full musical experience. In fact, I got to sit in front of *three* different Atmos rigs in three different (treated) rooms that evening and two of them were undoubtedly set up as good as they could have possibly been (One was a PMC showroom and the other built and tuned with their input). While the speakers themselves were impressive and very capable, the actual experience felt pretty disjointed. There was a pronounced feeling of phasi-ness that I didn't like.\n\nIt was great hearing these records on a rig that probably cost $250k, but my big takeaway was that they felt disjointed and odd. Even when sitting in the sweet spot.\n\nPerhaps my opinion will change with more exposure, but I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the time and effort. I will add, though, that half the mixes we heard were up-mixed from old stereo recordings with minimal track counts and only two of them were modern productions.",

Recording took us 7 days and they still needed to add synths and bass fot some of the songs after that (side note: the production wasn't finished by the time we tracked, so I edited everything I had - 10 songs, none of them with less than 5 minutes. It was the band's first time in the studio, also, and had to edit lots of drums and bass stuff). After doing a first pass, I sent them the multitracks they asked for, to track the rest of their stuff with their producer (a colleague of mine). The next 8 months were spent waiting on their files to start mixing (this was supposed to last 1/2 months, max). When I finally got the files, you have no ideia how messy the project turned out (track names, bounce mistakes, ultrapocessed tracks with artifacts - even the ones we've tracked at the studio before, audible edit points,... all you can imagine going wrong at this point), so it took me a bunch of time to organize everything in a way that I could work with what I've got (going back and forth asking the producer for some files that didn't even get to me or asking if there was the possibility to get some of the tracks dry, without processing or fx - keep this in mind).\n\nNeedless to say, when I was ready to start mixing, I was already overwhelmed and tired of it, and I knew I still had a long way to go...\n\nFirst version took me probably too long to get right (2 months, approx., working on other projects that got scheduled on those 8 months) and I've sent it before I went on a few days vacation.",

This would be being the new wave . It\u2019s vital in uk street music to be a creator of the wave / up on the new wave .....to garner attention . This dates back to jungle....where the producer/engineers were pioneering completely new sounds and rhythms via sampler technology midi and sampled breakbeats (amen , funky drummer etc ) . When a snare backbeat transitions from the use of a snare to instead a rimshot......or a particular clap sample.....and that track blows up, the wave moves . If you a year later release a track with the old snare on the backbeat instead of the rim .....that\u2019s dated . The same goes for the other percussions, the bass sounds (eg 808 / Moog in intro/bridge combi ) .....and the patterns . So this is why In twelve months most of the productions these artists are dithering over , will be out of date. It\u2019s just silly imo. Music is moving so fast and is ultimately so disposable at the mo holding onto it like some sort of special Tolkien esque ring is really just a vanity. Personally I\u2019d venture this is also the essence of what makes pop music trends discernible . That\u2019s just my opinion tho with respect to these genres.

He notes that it\u2019s particularly dangerous if an intelligent person gives you the requirements, as you may not question the requirements enough. \u201cEveryone\u2019s wrong. No matter who you are, everyone is wrong some of the time.\u201d He further notes that \u201call designs are wrong, it\u2019s just a matter of how wrong.\u201d\n\n**2) Try very hard to delete the part or process.** If parts are not being added back into the design at least 10% of the time, not enough parts are being deleted. Musk noted that the bias tends to be very strongly toward \u201clet\u2019s add this part or process step in case we need it.\u201d Additionally, each required part and process must come from a name, not a department, as a department cannot be asked why a requirement exists, but a person can.\n\n**3) Simplify and optimize the design.** This is step three as the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist.\n\n**4) Accelerate cycle time.** Musk states \u201cyou\u2019re moving too slowly, go faster! But don\u2019t go faster until you\u2019ve worked on the other three things first.\u201d\n\n**5) Automate.** An important part of this is to remove in-process testing after the problems have been diagnosed; if a product is reaching the end of a production line with a high acceptance rate, there is no need for in-process testing.",

I think I had mentioned this in a previous post, but these days notes tend to come in real time -- via text messages, dropbox comments, or sometimes even thoughtful emails. I'll usually take a quick glance, but then dump everything into a note file so I have everything in one place when I sit to do the revision. This can be useful when you'll get a thread of notes like 1) I'm not sure about the drum sound, it feel so x... then 2) someone else will chime in saying I love the drums! I think x is the problem then 3) first person is hesitant and shrugs of their not, even though it may still bother them. That way I can try and string together some sort of move that will hopefully make everyone happy. If you're dealing with a band -- and you're producing/engineering -- you'll have had the benefit of seeing the dynamic. Sometimes you get some people that are more engaged and tweaky, others that are unsure of EVERYTHING, and then people that when they say something, they're usually right, as infrequent as that may be. This is very useful during mix notes time because you have context. If you're just getting flies flown to you and you've never met the band/artist, thats certainly a bit more of a challenge and will likely require more work on your end to smooth things out.",

England had had breakbeat hardcore for a few years already (eg . Early early prodigy ) and then the British carribean community and others familiar with reggae and particularly the early 90s ragga scene in Jamaica , started fusing ragga acapellas and dub bass line motifs with hardcore \u2018s drum breaks .

Very useful on the service side\n\nBut some artists just have it like that. It\u2019s irrelevant, they just crush stuff and have a vision. Pure talent. And probably the rarest ones have both sides and are aware of it. Then you\u2019re truly dangerous\n\nHave seen this with some football guys I\u2019ve played with \u2014 I was one of the ones who studied the game deeply and could improve. But other guys showed up on day one, knew absolutely nothing but could just ball. Their knowledge of the game didn\u2019t even matter, they could just ball on instinct.

At times as a mixer I feel I have needed to become the 'producer by proxy'. As well I could imagine how a mastering eng might feel they need become the 'mixer by proxy'. This language arises for me the more aware I am of what a 'great vision for a song', 'great production', 'great mix' *could* be and what it actually is in front of me. As well as from preconceptions of what the record making roles are about. I'm trying to connect the idea of a producer being someone who uncovers or brings forth an artist's vision (i.e. *\"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free\" - Michelangelo*) and someone who sometimes needs to manifest the vision when it is lacking.",

Totally understand the hesitation to delegate - especially that first 6 months-a year where you're acutely aware that helping someone else do it is *more work* than just rolling up your sleeves and doing it yourself. \n\nFor building systems, what's worked for me is hiring and training your 'double(s)' first - someone with a similar skillset and sensibilities, very broad skills like me (who also did everything myself for a long time). This comes a lot easier if you have close friends in the same lane looking for jobs, I've seen people have their \"double(s)\" move in with them for a limited time too, with the intention of them soaking in exactly all you do.\n\nOnce my double(s) started doing pretty well, we started hiring more specialized people, and the doubles could then oversee their work, feedback etc - early on I would always be part of this, then slowly phase myself out.\n\nWhat I wish I would have done earlier would have been to hire a producer/overseer/manager/'my boss' - someone with a bit more skin in the game/responsibility, and who keeps you in line if you start wavering. \n\nAgain, I didn't love the setup of 10 and dissolved it eventually - as a creative it's easy to feel like you built a house/efficiency machine and one day you wake up and it's a prison that's not as flexible as you want. That's another thing I'm trying to keep in mind (I'm putting together a new similar team for this fall) - how do you keep the team agile and ready to shift when priorities shift? It could be as easy as accepting a little bit more churn & letting people go when they don't fit what's going on, but it's hard to let go of people you've trained and know well. I felt a friendship connection with my entire team, in hindsight I think that was a mistake too.\n\nThose are some thoughts haha - what have you found so far? Are you experiences lining up with mine? What kind of roles are you hiring for?",

The most meaningful collaborations I've had have been from me producing work that earns the respect and appreciation of my peers. The work itself is the alignment optimizer and the collaboration has almost always been downstream of that. I think its much harder to find alignment with 100 cold calls (which I've also tried). I think looking for a balance between producing music you really love and are proud of and cultivating a network of potential artists you would want to collaborate with is a good way of being. Which might be exactly what you're doing. Idk without more context.\n\nCould be helpful to think of it like a conversation and maybe you need to make the first move. Have you tried commenting on other artists work you come across online that you find compelling? Not in a spammy juice the numbers kinda way but more of a conscious attitude towards how you choose to travel online. I see that all the time leading to collaboration between artists.",

    "content": "If the alternative is to back home, I\u2019ll try to offer some advice from personal experience. I moved to Richmond, VA for a year, got a job at a hotel doing audio visual. I quit my first commercial/post production gig doing ads full time. It was the worst but I was determined to keep working in music, and try to get integrated in the scene/studio world. It was a serious low for my mental health, the job was terrible, I was struggling and scraping by without any pay off. To make a long story short, I applied for a job back home at a big corporate company with a full time composition/post production gig, on a whim - I didn\u2019t think it would get me anywhere. 3 months later I got the job and went back home after a year. I was out of the music scene back home at this point, and it took another year of reconnecting and working hard on my craft with friends who were willing to let me record their bands for the price  of drums heads and guitar strings, and honestly, those two things combined with some luck put me in a very secure and creative place, now making records for bands again that are paying decently well to boot. I don\u2019t know how far you are in your career/journey, but I\u2019m barely anything and have been recording for 15 years. It took me 5 years out of school to get barely a living wage and working lots of different types of audio jobs while making records, to get to a comfortable place emotionally, creatively, and financially. I\u2019d bet almost anybody in this discord has a very similar story. It takes a long time and like others have said, there\u2019s no one way to get there. Just keep doing you and trying to work on things that you enjoy.",

Every remote gig is different and I realize this situation is a lot of luck and circumstance. Don\u2019t be discouraged to take another gig. I was able to pay off high interest cards and can comfortably afford gear when I want it. I was full time in the studio from age 14-31 no other job. It was a transition, but one I\u2019m glad I made. I\u2019m still working mixing full time as well. I do production if I\u2019m stoked on the project. I work with rock bands for context. Just do dope work try not to compare. Remember there are some people with mountains of gear and dope setups they own. much respect to that. Others have rich parents, high interest credit debt, or both. I told myself if I wasn\u2019t rolling in it with a Grammy at 30 I would stop which is a super dumb mindset. I love making records more than anything and getting another gig allows me to keep doing it. Rant over best of luck to everyone \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd",

Set some realistic goals and just get going, vocabulary and technique Will come naturally if you just keep Playing. \n\nFuck Playing scales and inversions and all that for now. \nJust go learn a metric ton of songs and melodies and learn to play them together. Do it by Ear. It Will be tough in the beginning, but you Will get very decent quickly if you just do the most important Thing, which is being consistent.\n\nI would reccomend setting a low minimum to do everyday to keep a realistic goal that you can keep, rather than a higher on you miss every now and then. You can always add more practice but it sucks to miss out on it.\n\nStart with song you want to Sound like and then you can slowly branch out when the style become second Nature for you. \n\nSadly there are no tricks or hacks or whatever youtube wants you to beleive to get their clicks. Its all about muscle memory and developing your ears together. And not to Sound like 4 bar loop, but consistency, and do it a lot. I cannot stress that enough. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

My job is about realizing someone else's vision and pushing that to be the best it can be. If you're being hired as a producer, then like me, you have to believe that you're being hired for your taste and perspective. So the question is, why doesn't it feel good to you? Is there something undiscovered that could make it better?\n\nI've written a lot of music that's outside of my aesthetic or personal tastes. But if I'm on the project, I'm going to be 100% invested in helping make that thing what it needs to be. There's a way into music that's outside of your vibe - sometimes it's getting excited about new techniques, sometimes it's exploring a genre you're unfamiliar with, and sometimes it's just because the people you're making music with are a good hang. Sometimes, the role of a composer (or producer) is to take their vision and find the version of it that **does **get you excited. We've probably all had that experience of \"I really never listen to X, but this one song/artist is just undeniable.\" So strive for that.",

Really interesting stuff, and @BatMeckley made me start thinking about it more with his comment about guitar gear. We as a collective grow and evolve over time and go through cycles but there are fundamentals that still remain true. We want to capture the emotion and represent something that will best suit the song. Different production and mixing styles help accomplish that but it\u2019s cool to see how things change over time.

Of course, that was the wrong approach, and the more i\u2019ve just provided broad themes to the group - i.e. make the sounds in front of you \u201cangry, happy, distant, close\u201d or \u201cwe will record/mix/master an EP within the next few weeks\u201d the better the sessions go, and the more inquistive the students are to uncover the \u201clearning\u201d as they are doing.  I find making a fool of myself (\u201centertainment\u201d) helps with this as it\u2019s a useful tool to disarm the groups and build rapport.

I move slowly and make sure I understand before I move on. It may take two months to complete, but I'm steady with it and I do a little bit most days. It's common for me to transcribe notes from high-density talks that I want to learn from and revisit them often over the span of a week. I'm constantly printing out my notes and reading material so that they're easy to revisit throughout the week.\n\nI'm currently taking a project management course through MIT, which has been great. It's uncommon for me to do formal schooling these days, but this is work related and a direct application to my future capabilities that we thought would be beneficial for the company.\n\nWhen I buy a new plugin (rare) I set aside time to go through it and turn every knob and try each feature to see what it's capable of. Learning a tool on the spot is a good way to kill the creative flow, so I do the exploration up-front when possible.\n\nOften I'll have ideas for novel ways to use a tool (layering distortion, for example) and I'll set aside two hours to explore it and see what I find.\n\nThat said, I think my day-to-day may be quite different from a lot of folks here. My eggs aren't all in the business and pressures of record production, and so I rarely find myself buried in such commitments. I tend to keep \"normal\" business hours these days and keep a hard separation between my commitments and my leisure.\n\nIn fact I'd say that I'm actively structuring my life so that I can retain my leisure and don't find myself overwhelmed with commitments.

Learning how to have difficult discussions (even just learning 10 different ways to communicate \"that still isn't good, let's do another take\") is such a huge part of what we do. But honest, open communication is almost always the best solution. \n\nThe only other thing I'll add regarding @Zack Hames's initial question is that I find it super valuable to continue to do all kinds of different roles. If I've mostly been programming and finishing productions, I'll take some time to write a song and sing it myself, so I stay \"in shape\" with writing and recording vocals. If I don't do something myself, how can I empathize with someone? My communication style is always one of \"I know how you're feeling and you can trust me because I've done it a ton.\"",

The producer, lead singer/songwriter, guitar dude who is clearly leading the charge creatively, a manager, etc. etc. who you can turn to in order to give definitive direction... maybe during covid this is more difficult as I feel that often can become clear organically in the room.\n\nIf it\u2019s truly a situation where there are contradictory/unproductive notes coming in, maybe either a) tell them they need to decide amongst themselves and then give you a clear list of notes, or b) take the lead yourself and really push for what you feel serves the song best/explain why the sax can\u2019t be 10x louder than the lead vocal? Which option is best I\u2019d say depends on your relationship with them, how much of a lead you want to take creatively, how confident you are in making the right choices for this song, etc. etc.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @cian riordan might have better advise for these situations!",

If you had a perfect reflective surface that reflected back at a 180-deg angle into the null of the mic, that might be the case. But thats very rarely what happens in the real world. The cardioid pattern is shaped like a kidney and does stretch beyond the x-axis of the diaphragm, ultimately picking up lots of reflections from behind the plane of the capsule. Put a condenser microphone on a floor tom, under a cymbal and you'll hear what I mean. Or try singing into the backside of one. It sounds awful. Often, its the shittiest of the phasey reflections that get in through the back, so it's definitely worth treating. To your point, still lots of value in making sure behind the singer is treated as well as those reflections will likely be much more broadband. But given the size of this space (it small), I'd use all the help I could get in there.",

    "content": "My main tip for using Live live is try and replace as many third party plugins as you possibly can with stock, freeze as much as you can, and most of the latency you experience is going to be coming from internal delay compensation vs I/O latency.  If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

But 50% of my music income are gigs that I\u2019m taking to pay the bills, the rest are projects that I feel somewhat passionate, or very passionate about. \n\nThe living expenses have increased due to inflation and I\u2019m also trying to save up money to get a car, so I am thinking about quitting my current day job to get another day job that will give me more hours. \n\nOn months that I couldn\u2019t make my ends meet, I did little things like snow shoveling for neighbors\u2019 houses. I have not done lawn mowing but any one time gig with no schedule commitment can be a good option. The reason why I had to do this is because my day job wouldn\u2019t give me any more hours. \n\nMy issue lately has been the fact that I live in a very expensive city (Boston, MA), and I am barely making it work. More than 50% of the work I do heavily relies on being on-site (recording, live sound, and some parts of the production process).  If I moved further out from the city- the rent would not get cheaper enough to justify getting a car for the commute. And if I moved out of state to somewhere like Albany, NY or Rhode Island- I will be giving up huge part of my clientele and half of my income.

Let's say you as a producer are not vibeing with the artist's direction / vision for a song, but the artist feels very passionate about their vision. You help them realize their vision all the way through and it still doesn't feel good to you or any other involved party other than the artist. What then?\n\nI'm curious to hear some thoughts on the producer's perspective and the artist's perspective. To paint the extremes a little bit; at what point does being disagreeable as a producer (when dictated by your own taste / gut / intuition) become a hindrance to the project or unprofessional? And for the artist at what point are you getting in your own way so to speak and diminishing the potential outside contribution from collaborators that could level up your work?",

Like when the artist asked for a wetter vocal, we don\u2019t just crank the verb right? We make sure it\u2019s not causing problems mucking up transients etc. same with instrumentation and all. \n2) it\u2019s the artist we\u2019re serving. So when we\u2019re done and have gotten paid, they\u2019re the ones who have to go out and tour it, promote it, share it with they\u2019re moms and kids and SOs etc. They need to be happy with it. \n3) if we can\u2019t make 1 happen, we make 2 happen and move on to the next one. \n\nGenerally I find the more I\u2019m able to serve the artist\u2019s vision, over time the trust grows and they become more interested and even reliant on consensus.

Of course no one is required or would have any reason to buy modern records as physical copies, but the culture of treasure hunt coming back sounds really nice and exciting. If youth and younger generations can appreciate things beyond the current times, it would be very enriching culturally. \n\ncool thing about vinyls are what comes with it too, sometimes they come with pictures and scores of horn arrangements- even though those are probably accessible online too, it\u2019s just a different experience. it\u2019s like having a poster vs computer wall paper",

    "content": "@joshbonanno said:\n\ni think the premise of this stems from the constant fight that i feel like we all face... \n\nwanting something to be the \"best\" it can be (at least in our personal minds and perspectives) vs the sometimes reality that we are hired to do a \"job\" and not everything is going to meet our expectations of what we personally think is great. \n\nbecause at the end of the day, we aren't the artist. In some cases, even the intended audience. with that said, if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. \n\n/ might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it. \n\nso who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. \n\nthis is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world. but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

In short, mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species as a biproduct of producing ATP and use an electron gradient in this process. Electromagnetic fields impact this electron gradient in a way that can increase the rate of ROS production, and ROS presence is basically inextricably tied to inflammation. Think about the word \u201cinflammation\u201d and what fire is fundamentally. Fire is oxygen rapidly deionizing things so fast that it forms a plasma. Similarly, when ROS increases inside of you, you\u2019re literally lighting fire to microscopic particles inside of you. You are thus \u201cinflamed\u201d. It don\u2019t feel good.",

When the production company wants world-class sound, and it's your job to create the budget...   knowing that sample libraries can only take you so far is key to explaining to the client WHY they should allocate budget for humans. \"I can create this with just the computer, and it will sound great....  but it won't sound like your example.  There's a real VALUE to humans playing the music and that extra 10% of the quality you're looking for requires a studio session with real players\" \n\nInstant path to budget upgrade.  Suddenly the expense makes sense to them.  Now you get the pleasure of hiring all your friends and deliverying something that sounds top notch...  and you can take the client on a mind-blowing field-trip.  It took me years to learn this trick...   clients don't want to pay mountains of money extra for you to sit in front of your computer and massage CC lanes....  and if they have a mindblowing time in the studio and the track sounds ALIVE?

There is also a lot of pushing and pulling the artists to fit their expectations instead of serving the art and letting nature take its course. Specifically theres a lot of \"I can't wait to help you realize the full expression of your music and art when we work together!!!!!!!!\" kind of vibe which is great internally but puts off older artists a little bit. I've seen it a lot over the last couple years with young producers and engineers and I wonder if its because of the pandemic, honestly.

My two cents: if there isn\u2019t a designated producer in the room and you\u2019re fulfilling both the engineer/producer roles then trying to get from load in to recording as quickly as possible seems to work well - that way they can be witness and collaborator to any sonic changes. Like someone was talking about a producer who just dampened the toms right away - maybe that was necessary but if the artist hasn\u2019t heard both options in the same room on the same song then they\u2019re left with nothing but faith that this is the right decision. But if you just start recording quickly and then chime in with \u201chey, I feel like maybe the toms are ringing out for too long, can we try dampening them on this next take?\u201d They\u2019re probably more likely to try it out.",

Worked on 75 songs, most of them full instrumental productions taking them from a demo, playing / recording everything, and often mixing. It was a really exciting year but I found I spent most of the time being reactive, rather than proactive, just trying to stay on top of getting things out the door on time! \n\nWhat do y'all do to make sure you get time thinking about what you'd like to see happen in your career (everything from people you want to work with, music you want to create, gear you want to purchase), and organize it in an actionable way so that your time spent making stuff for other people also takes you where you want to go long-term?

Or why hire a producer when the artists demos are so good that you can just release that? Why have a songwriter when the artists just write their own songs? I don't disagree with you at all. I know that this is the case and am sure that my pirate ship is sailing in shallow waters... it's only a matter of time before I wash ashore. While I do applaud the evolution of the music making process and the ingenuity of the players moving the needle, if I *were* to make a stupid line graph, I don't think the quality of the work will rise as fast as high as the increase in efficiency... it's likely to invert.",

I\u2019m a young person in early 20s, so also seeking advice/people\u2019s thoughts on this.\n\nWouldn\u2019t you say it would be better to be decent at all of the things mentioned above for paths like producer? It isn\u2019t required to be good at all of things because hiring other people is always an option, but starting out- I\u2019m working with projects with lower budgets where people can barely afford to hire a producer. \n\nI want to have one strong path, and strength within those skill sets- but I feel like being well rounded wouldn\u2019t hurt if there is one clear path I want to work on. And it seems to me that the path encompasses many different skills. For example, I would work on my instrumental skills, engineering skills, and arrangement skills- but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily seek to pursue these career paths unless I was asked to because I know that primary focus is in production. I would still take gigs in different areas if the pay my bills, but if I get to a point where I can make full living exclusively from production work- I will not take other gigs unless I\u2019m passionate enough to the point I wouldn\u2019t mind doing them for free. To sum up my thoughts or desires on this- I want to build proficiencies in all areas because I believe they are part of the path I want to go through. Although I wouldn\u2019t necessarily pursue a career in those areas I\u2019m developing but I will still take the gigs until I\u2019m paying all my bills and able to build proper savings solely from one thing I would ultimately want to do. \n\nIt may sound like I\u2019ve already made up my mind, but I\u2019m eager to hear people\u2019s thoughts on this because this is something I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time especially because I hear people say \u201cniche down\u201d or \u201cfocus on one thing\u201d.",

I can always HDMI I figure if I need the extra real estate.\n\nThe only acustica plug I run regularly is Ruby 2 - seems to cause pretty drastic spikes on the CPU short term in Ableton (running rosetta mode and VST3 by the way) but then it levels out.  In general I've been super impressed with the performance vs my desktop.  I'd say for my mixes it runs maybe 80% as well on large projects (75+ tracks, lots of processing) which was more than I was expecting.  Smaller projects and productions and softsynths it absolutely chews through compared to my desktop.\n\nWas just trying out a little mix in Studio One just on the 14\" and it felt very cramped to me.  I think it'd be hard to completely mix at this resolution but again it probably has more to do with what I'm used to.  Would definitely recommend a separate display if you are going to be doing all your work on it.",

One of my friends told me \u201cit\u2019s because you haven\u2019t learned how to make the generic stuff that has been working\u201d and it took me a while to digest this and accept it, but I\u2019m in the process of doing that and if I know the formula for what works- I can probably deviate in a more appealing way that makes sense to the audience",

The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nI want to add to what Ruair\u00ed and Matt B said with another perspective. I've had the privilege of working in some very professional settings, where everyone needs to fade into the background to do their jobs properly, and that's absolutely the case at higher levels. And it makes things work. And everyone's cool about it.\n\nBut much of my work has been as producer, assistant producer or project manager/fixer for people working at decidedly lower levels. \n\nAnd idk how it is in other countries, but we have a glut of people here in the US who have a certificate from a for-profit recording school that says they know what they're doing, who think they're *the shit* for being in the room with some viral star off YouTube/Instagram/TikTok. But don't know how to use a damn patch bay. \n\nAnd when you're on the come up, especially as a writer or producer, you interact with a lot of these people, and you get REALLY sick of them REALLY fast. So that might be the source of some of the condescension you see. It's hard not to get jaded when you have to wade through so much incompetence.

I made the absolute mistake in my second or third week of suggesting something to the drummer in the band after a performance. Eric overheard and pulled me aside. Basically said something along the lines of \u201cyo, you really can\u2019t do that. If you have an idea, run it through me. Absolutely inappropriate, however well intentioned it was.

More recently, when James Horner died during the scoring of The Magnificent Seven, his assistant/arranger finished the score. \n\nThe difference between this and the pop example is there is no AI technology used to imitate the person, which feels like a parlor trick to me. I am all for finishing unfinished art, but unless there was an express wish from the artist to use their voice via AI tech, then I say make it known what it is. Finish the production by bringing in other people to celebrate the spirit of the original voice. Pay tribute. Sort of like Japanese Kintsugi, where you're drawing attention to what it's not to elevate what it is. (This is not the intention of kintsugi exactly, but I can't think of a better metaphor at the moment).",

How do we manipulate these harmonics in a controlled way electrically And how did we discover this ? It\u2019s imho mind blowing ......\n\nto your point about the complexity of understanding distortion , I feel like maybe this is what I\u2019m going to need to understand \n\n I need to find the answer in physics as to how can a voice be transmitted as an electron flow, then re rendered as a human voice again .....its  fascinating to think a voltage / current can carry the information that is someone\u2019s voice and the emotion of a performance \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.

I was watching rod waves engineer discussing creating value with another successful engineer . They were discussing that in the late 90d producers (like Timbo and pharell ) had created enough cache for themselves that the perceived value of their work (productions ) was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars . They were discussing that the industry has changed and now engineers are the closest personnel to artists . And that engineers should be leveraging this and marketing ourselves to increase our earning potential , as a job role industry wide",

So what ends up happening is that we\u2019re struggling relying on making a living paid by those who are also struggling. \n\nThe culture of music should shift towards the direction where if the artist is able to provide enough values for people to want to hear more work from them, then people should be down to fund it. The issue is that everyone\u2019s expenses are more likely going to be prioritizing commodities over intangible products like music. NFT seemed to attempt commodifying music, but just like modern art paintings- they just became a method of investment for monetization, avoiding taxes, or status; nor it was accessible enough for everyday people to want to get into it.",

The industry does value and pay some of its operatives absurd money......everyday....i know some of them and listen to their conversations as they drift out the other room in my house.....unfortunately as it goes , due to our class structure in england.....a lot of those people have cut glass accents and come from a certain [privelidged strata in society they were born into. They are getting paid mega bucks . Their value is enshrined by societys perception of that value. Lawyers, economists etc......meanwhile, engineers have the ability to literally lockdown the industry........but here we are discussing things in the framework of whether we even deserve to demand what is a given for those profiting from the fruits of this labour",

But if you end up going all the way, it still is a worthy project, you should still give it 100% of yourself. Learn something new and useful. And if you do, you should be proud of having your name on something you know you gave your best (even if the rest of it wasn't ideal, your part was the best you could do, at least in a certain moment in time).\n\nSo, I'm all for: work in it, own it.

The \"Greedy\" song that's topping the charts is so close to 'Promiscuous' as well, we're in an era where we keep getting a lot of \"Old Hit 2.0\" and I wish there was a little more art going into it. These are some of my favorite producers doing it too (Max/Ilya, Tedder/Harris). \n\nMaybe I was just more oblivious previously but I don't remember it being this on the nose in the past with top tier releases",

This would have all been on the back end of Larry levan and the paradise garage parties in Manhattan that pretty much gave birth to New York garage sound , while Frankie knuckles and Marshall Jefferson  were shepherding the Chicago  house seen and saunderson , dereck may dj Pierre and carter. Etc were pioneering Detroit techno . Meantimes in london the producers that would go on to give birth to our rave and jungle scenes were soaking all this in . The boss of my first label (a U.K. garage label ) was busy getting hold of exclusive U.K. licenses to release all this stuff in the U.K. including the absolute smash robin s show me love.

I went into UK Funky and we were all listening to Ferrer and Chandler .....Quentin Harris was another great dj with some great tracks at that time .....we had a club in London called the east village which was explicitly mimicking the Manhattan east village vibe at the time and Quentin Harris held a night there monthly I\u2019d go down to .\n\nV v cool. \n\nHe and Dennis personified the concept of using space and silence in a production imho .\n\nCheck Dennis ferrer - touched the sky . This tune was huge here . Wonderful house production \n\nAnd Quentin Harris remix of Justin timber lake \u201cwhat goes around \u201c ....a beguiling steady building deep groove .\n\nThe opening  section to sonny fodera and MK,s  \u201casking \u201c (out now ) reminded me of proper house and garage from the late 90s / early 00,s like Rui da silva touch me and trippin by gold trix feat Andrea brown \n\n.....and it had me thinking about doing a few house and garage tracks again myself. The hip hop culture imho has become stagnant and toxic at the mo imho and I don\u2019t perceive much  appreciation for artistry as it stands.....feel myself drifting off into other genres ...\n\nMaybe time to swap the 808 back to the 909",

Silly name, but a stimulating read.\n\nIn the article David describes his epiphany about how popular flavor profiles in recipes re-occur across cultural boundaries. How a Chinese spicy pork sausage and rice cake has the same fundamental flavor profile as an Italian ceci e pepe and they share underlying structures that are expressed differently in their respective cultural incarnations. In math this would be called an isomorphism.\n\nWell this immediately rang to true to me because I'd observed the same thing in music. I thought about this article for a year. Finally I saw that they were giving a talk in a hotel showroom with 500 people in attendance and made it a point to attend.\n\nWhen the open mic was passed around I asked my prepared question, expressing my admiration for their insight and how it was applicable to other domains beyond food. I asked them if they'd had any additional insights on this phenomena since publishing the article.\n\nThey both looked to each other, didn't say a word, and then proceeded to ask for the next question \ud83d\ude15.\n\nTo this day I have no idea what happened.",

The stuff I get commissioned for is in the style of street photography, which might be why I\u2019m better at recognising a good take than trying to coax one. \n\nBut for me, overlaps in these crafts can really be extended to many others, and I don\u2019t find the medium itself to be the parts of the Venn diagram that meet. So that\u2019s why I wrote that I\u2019m not a parallels type of person - I won\u2019t naturally be drawn to those sorts of things to push me forward.\n\nWhat _was_ helpful was getting to know myself more and how I work. And that really informed / improved my other pursuits.",

I don't even necessarily listen to everyone's music, I'm often more intwrested in their personal approaches - especially since lost are folk who we'd consider \"established\"  and what I found to be true for most of them is they split into 2 main camps with most of us dancing between them. \n\na) have 0 clue wtf they're going for a lot of the time. kind of going with the flow of whatever is happening /they're feeling in the moment. very similarly to people starting out or me. the approach can vary wildly and a whole concept can be born of something seemingly unimportant at any given moment. \n\nb) there's an outline that comes to mind early and might give some direction. whether that's thematically or sonically. how tightly they stick to this can vary a lot depending on the artist. \n\nI think there are many factors that come into play - how good and ready the team they have is might be one of the most important imo. that's both for the creative side and admin side. \n\nas far answering  your questions as a producer, it depends. \nsome artist I work with will literally dream up the whole production and I'm kind of facilitating and bringing it into the real world. others will come with loose ideas and others will show up with absolutely nothing and go off the feeling in the moment. some are more involved than others in the production\n\nyour relationship with them is probably the biggest factor in knowing how far you can push their creatively bounderies. \nsame artist that dreams up their production usually gives me free range to try whatever I want when the session is over and I've overhauled whole songs.  recently a post-punk ish artist picked up a video game ost /jazz fusion prod I was sketching",

Into mixer . \nOnly major difference to writing in the daw is timing of the mpc. Be aware if you\u2019re tracking it into your daw it won\u2019t line up on the grid as its timing drifts . So if you like easy grid based edits of overdubs etc it gets a little more complicated than usual . I wasted a bit of time trying to work out the problem then slaving the mpc to daw MTC which then just removes the mpc swing which is counterproductive . So yeah , if at any point it\u2019s gonna be tracked into the daw familiarise and strategise for that asap in the process .",

It\u2019s been my first full band project in a while, I was doing mostly solo artist production (where I had a lot of creative input and played a lot of instruments and was dealing with one persons vision instead of 4).",

Right now with the government restrictions in Ireland, sooo many businesses are closing and it's near impossible to get a job. \nSo my college then went remote, meaning I had alot more free time on my hands, and no steady income.. This kinda forced me to go all in on production. College finished last May for summer, and I worked hard as fuck on being a better mixer and producer (with the virtual help of Matt and Jon) and also tried to figure ways of making money from it.. Apart from working with local artists (there aint too many here in Dublin) most of the work I got and still get was through soundbetter.com, after a while of grinding I got to a stage where I was and still am, only making a little bit less than the job I was in before, so I can at least survive lol.\n\nBasically long story short, I'm actually kinda full time music right now while finishing off my college degree. Then I've to make a decision of whether I remain fulltime music here, go part time and get a job from my degree, or move to the US or London to pursue music there. It'll prob be one of the latter 2 options cos the scene here is very much in it's early days and not sure if a sustainable career could be had.\nAlso as I said here before I'm very fortunate to live in a country where you can get free education, so debt isn't a worry for me. \n\nThat's my long ass story anyways, since you asked \ud83e\udd23",

When I say simplicity I'm thinking of a song like \"Back In Black\" by AC/DC which is stripped-down, direct, and has no extra frills. All the parts serve a strong purpose and support that feel. Great song. Very powerful. On the other hand, I think of an equally good song with a big, layered, arrangement with lots of multi-tracked parts, stacked vocals, etc ala \"Rock With You\" by Michael Jackson. The song has tons of parts all coming in and out. Equally as compelling.",

When y'all are layering parts how are you approaching it? I'm always asking myself, do we really need this? However I love all the ear-candy that you can get with that kind of approach, so I want to encourage that and leave the door open.",

I currently have a separate production/writing template and then another for mixing but I\u2019m trying to hybridise and streamline them a little more to get faster results and hopefully focus on the song. Also, most of the songs I mix tend to be one\u2019s I\u2019ve written and produced as well, so hoping to cut down on session set-up time.\n\nSome of mine are an instant \u201cduck bus\u201d, which I picked up from Ian Kirkpatrick. It\u2019s a pre-loaded aux with something like LFO Tool or shaper box on it, so you can quickly route and uniformly make things side chain.\n\nAnother quick workflow thing I love is having Pro Tools audio playlists with a bunch of reverse sweeps, impacts and other transition fx/ear candy hidden and ready to go in the session, so you can quickly try out a bunch. \n\nI also have the trim plugin added as the first and last plugin on every new track preset, as I use them to quickly manage the gain in and out of each track and so I don\u2019t have to search for them constantly.\n\nOzone Spectral shaper on some music busses and as a replacement for Soothe on the mix bus has also been a real win (thanks Jon!) Although these sorta things aren\u2019t turned on whilst writing as they have a ton of latency.\n\nKeen to hear what you all find useful!",

It's silly to think that a mastering engineer spending a day mastering an album will have as much impact as an artist spending years writing & producing that very record. I also think all of these various roles within the record making process have evolved over time... the creative roles have become more technical and the technical roles have become more creative. Only a matter of time before the venn diagram below becomes one circle.",

The big holdout for me was the NI Massive X synthesizer, which *just* got Rosetta compatibility *today*. That was probably the big \"can't live without\" thing for me.\n\nI even got my UA Apollo to work, though it seem to have an additional 2 ms or so of input latency, so I think it'll have to be optimized better.\n\nI haven't tried installing Pro Tools yet. Honestly, if Pro Tools never touches my new computer it will probably be better off for it. I loathe Digidesign's software.",

To apply that logic to situations beyond the time value of money isn\u2019t the whole picture: that law of economics only compares value, it doesn\u2019t tell us that concentrating labor for short term gains yields the best possible business model. By that logic, there is an argument that everyone\u2019s best business decision is to forego longterm relationship building, knowledge acquisition (which is like R&D for producers), and strictly focus on maximizing immediate sales (which could look like everyone hopping on beatstars, fiverr, and enginears) which would diminish resources like this very discord, and probably a lot of reputations too!",

To your point @BatMeckley , for where im at in my humble level of the hierarchy, the demo-itis thing has been a real handicap already with regard to what i wanted for a mix/production (its usually mostly with reverb on the vocals for me....I want it drier they want it soaked )  but then i watched Bainz on your live matt , post the Punk album release and he looked like he had PTSD for demoitis , so i figured its par for the course. Overall, i love recording so its not a chore, but sometimes it seems like the artist is getting in their own (and my \"producers's) way)   and  so again, I really appreciate you both sharing your strategies for handling these moments.",

The way I see it is sync placement is fulfilling more of the utility aspect of art, while making records for people to listen to is a more artistic endeavor in service of the people that listen to the records. But the reality is that everyone\u2019s streaming and that doesn\u2019t pay. Even with the biggest success- it won\u2019t make money correspondent to the level of success. \n\nBudget for record production is now more of a PR for their shows or tours. (As far as what I can tell)\n\nSo why in a sane mind would anyone spend money on making it other than for their own satisfaction? It\u2019d be insane to see making records as business investment unless you\u2019re really aiming for sync in mind. But then, what most of us fell in love with are the amazing records that we grew up listening to. Maybe a song from a movie occasionally, but probably not quite a track from sports spot nor a jingle. \n\nAt this point, is there really a way to monetize real money from records other than sync? If there can be, what would that be?",

I dont disagree with you that what you are both describing is true for where we are at currently and have been for some time. im trying (badly) to not promote my view as opposed to the views shared by the engineers in the discussion im referencing....but fwiw , in 2022 the global recording revenue i think was around 20 billion dollars. Thats a lot of dough. Im not a socialist....im not against the free market.......the discussion was centred around the growing leverage engineers have in the industry and whether that is being marketed effectively to increase the price of the skilled labour engineers provide. When i first started getting indie production deals i was adviesd in the music business, when it comes to discussing deals, everyone's friends...when it comes to paying on those deals......no-one's friends....its only business. I have found this to be true and have no objection to it.",

Where is money to be made and who's making it? \n\nPicking a nice round number, if you're an engineer on an album that gets a million streams a year, that's something like $4000 for the artist. Hopefully they generate money from touring, but based on the album's services alone, how much could an artist reasonably pay if their ROI is $4k?\n\nIf the gamble is to get hooked up with a new artist who has the potential to break through, the producer's points on a hit is where real money could be made, right? So pricing yourself to get at many chances at the lottery would likely be more fruitful than a few extra hundred per gig, but it's a gamble. Between repeat clients and chance for a moderate hit, it seems like a better way to spend your time\n\nAll that said, as you pointed out, this ain't my lane.",

In case anyone is interested there's a book that @shaunobi shared about previously here called '*Chokepoint Capitalism*' that I believe provides an interesting context for some of the topics / ideas from this convo. I'm about halfway through it myself.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk here about there not being enough money entering into the top of the music industry, but far less talk about how little of the money that does flows towards the artists and producers of the art that drives the industry and culture.\n\nThe book makes a pretty compelling case that copyright law, antitrust law / enforcement (or lack thereof), regulatory capture, the consolidation of power in the music industry and formation of monopolies / monopsonies with anticompetitive flywheels has greatly contributed to the reality or perception by some that the average creative worker in this industry is getting less in return for the actual value they are putting in.

It\u2019s an art and it takes love of the record......but I\u2019d recommend going this way with it .....I think @Deleted User .....said it right. The internet is awash with sample packs that are just the same hits renamed. You can grab all the OG Roland and linn drum kits in seconds these days......and all the processed versions of them since . If  you sample things yourself you\u2019re curating as you go and this will imo , make it different and valuable. D\u2019angelo voodoo, Dre 2001; Wookie and James brown gave me all I needed for drums for the longest .",

That alone is a lot of TB connections. But then the afterburner card is in slot 5, yep. I can move that to slot 3 leaving my OWC Accelsior 8M2 in slot 4. I may also need to redistribute my TB connections to lighten the load. \n\nCurrently, my 3xApollo's are daisy chained and fed into Slot 8 (Mac IO) with two USB connections also there (1 is midi box). \n\nIt's mind blowing that I never really thought to think about WHERE I am plugging things in, so naive. \n\nI'm going to try moving some things around and will report back. \n\nLast thought - should I just...rip out the Afterburner all together?",

We talked about a bunch of stuff but one of the themes we explored was the idea that one needs a \u201cportfolio\u201d of slick & great sounding work to get hired\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided that then it becomes the focus, and changes the way things feel and the way decisions about time, who you work with etc get made. Concepts like \u201cI\u2019ll suck it up and work for free but *then* I will have a singular \u201cgood track\u201d for my portfolio\u201d. Of course there are exceptions but it feels to me that there\u2019s something very constricting and materialist about this way of being in the world. There can be a tension between what the artist wants or what the song wants to be and what makes you look \u201cgood\u201d in your portfolio - they want mono and grimy but you want wide/lush/impressive\n\nIn our jam I proposed a kind of thought experiment, an end of the line or extreme of the \u201cneed portfolio\u201d way of thinking\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say you are here, a young writer, producer, mixer. You\u2019ve been doing it 3 or 4 years. You feel that one of the reasons you are not getting hired, getting shots or getting paid well is that there isn\u2019t a body of work for a potential client to judge you by. Ok, here\u2019s comes the magic trick. I\u2019m going to grant you a genie wish portfolio! 5 killer tracks with  great collaborators. Not hot 100 #1 but the kind of work that you really feel would represent you best in the world. Boom. There it is\u2026\n\nSo now what? You get some DMs and sessions start happening. But you\u2019re not ready. You\u2019re not fit for game day. You\u2019re in over your head, and don\u2019t have the fluency, the experience, the reps and the humblings that build a great music business pro. In short you\u2019re not ready for the opportunities the genie wish portfolio granted you",

If I\u2019m \u201cmaking content\u201d and notice that I\u2019m doing so out of a place that is less than genuine, I will just delete and move on. \n\nFor me, the \u201cmix tips\u201d thing came out of a sincere place of excitement and passion. I would, as a growing mix engineer, stumble upon something that excited me, and I would find myself wanting to turn around to the people in the room to share\u2026well, there\u2019s almost never anyone in the room with me. So, I channeled that passion and excitement in a genuine way to share with the small community of mixers, mastering engineers and producers that I knew on IG. \n\nAt the beginning of my career on to the middle of my career, that became a very fruitful source of business for me - people who followed me on IG, who enjoyed my posts, and began to view me as someone who MIGHT know a thing or two about mixing. \n\nAs my career has developed and my clientele has growing, that has become less important, but it was absolutely pivotal in helping me build a deep bench of great clients, both indie and signed. \n\nBut\u2026I NEVER did it for that reason. It was always (and continues to be) a genuine result of my passion for what I do.",

Has huge sine bass notes in a few sections that were chattering a bit with the short iZotope maximizer release. This mixer uses the same limiter setting on every mix and I copy it and work from non limited mix, sometimes tweaking slightly\n\nSo bass distortion sounds cool to me, but more importantly it was in the REF. So to my mind it\u2019s cool and in the artist\u2019s signpost of intention \u2026. But they wanted it clean (which was possible and pretty easy)\n\nI guess the message and the reason for putting it in general is that we\u2019re all under the gun with deadlines, and all through the process there can be a sense of it\u2019s just a demo, just a producer ref,. just a mix ref \u2026. we\u2019ll nail it later.

    "content": "With credits, is there a general consensus or definition on the distinction between  \"producer\" and \"additional production\" or is it always a case by case thing? Had a song I worked on (finished the production and did the mix) come out today. At the beginning of the project I had asked to be listed as a producer and mixer but realized when it came out, that the artist had listed himself as the producer and me as additional production/instrumentation, and mixer. The artist is a really good and longtime friend and I am going to just talk to him and ask that he fixes the credits (and will start making written agreements before all of my projects) but I am curious if there is any broader context that could help how I approach the conversation? \n\nNot super critical to the main question but here are some specifics of my situation: Artist wrote the song, and recorded some basic tracks (drums, vox, guitar). We then worked on it in my studio and I played more instruments (bass, guitars, keys, lap, steel, percussion). We then finished it remotely a few months later. Sent the Ableton production session back and forth a few times times and then I prepped and exported the files myself and mixed it in Protools. And I had to do what I would consider a fair amount of heavy lifting in the mix: song was pretty complicated and recorded at home so I ended up do doing a lot of clean up, some tuning, and a lot of sound shaping and effects. All that to say, this case feels pretty cut and dried but I am curious to know what types of work would appropriately fall under \u201cadditional production\u201d and what is standard in the industry.

And I agreed to do the project and set my rate (offered a pretty significant friend discount) under the premise that I would be credited in a certain way. I totally understand that some artists want to be the only producer on their projects and if I was ghost producing a song for someone I would have probably charged a lot more. Either way, that doesn't seem like something that an artist gets to decide on their own after the song has already been completed. In my case I think it was just an honest mistake or he forgot or we had a miscommunication and its an easy thing to check in about and resolve. But it just made me wonder going forward if there is a clearer distinction between the two roles.",

'Producer' is shown but no field for 'additional production'.\n\nI agree with what others were alluding to in that it's worth considering how asking for revised credits impacts the relationship and that caution and being respectful towards and honoring the artist's story is valuable.",

He found a little piece of magic and somehow got the band to let go of their prior conceptions of their identify and record the song. Some Jedi shit for real. \n\nHow do I do that? Should I do that? How should we as producers think about point of view when creating for/with artists? To what extent should we be involved in crafting the point of view? What should we do when an artist has potential but is lacking a distinct point of view? What is even is point of view?\n\nAny thoughts would be welcome.",

I don't force it but because of being so open about it there are artist I mix for for example that only send me dry vocals cause they like what i do.  or I get producer /artist that will send me a rough and tell me to go wild and we'll edit and arrange later. \n\nsome artist hand me their writings / poems to help them convert into lyrics. some I'll help edit stuff as we're recording.\n\nour  job is to do what we  think is best for the song. that may involve pushing the artist sometimes but putting yourself in a position that allows them to receive that push is most important  i.e your relationahip w them.",

To become the most whole version of themselves, imho. \n\nYour job as a producer is to create a safe and encouraging space where they can explore and express it, say scary things, move forward in their ideas. It\u2019s also your job to then facilitate the process at every stage, musically and otherwise, to make sure the execution is as good as it can possibly be.

    "content": "In my experience, every artist has a very specific \"point of view\" with varying degrees of how well they know and/or express it. Sometimes we're in the studio with very specific goals in mind. For example: to sound like the the musical equivalent of the artist's Pinterest board, to sound like two of the artist's favorite artists had a baby together, to sound like the last album but different, or just to make our own version of an already-established style of music. On the other hand, sometimes we're searching and digging and discovering to see what happens. In these production sessions it may seem like there are no goal posts -- the goal is there but it's just not readily apparent. Maybe the artist doesn't seem like they even know what they want but they do and they'll know it when they hear it. And then once (if) you get to that aha! moment, it's like hitting something hard when digging for treasure in the sand. Maybe it's just a rock, or maybe it's coprolite or maybe, just maybe it's a chest full of gold coins which you can then hand over to the labels, managers, lawyers and streaming services while you keep a couple of the remaining fragments of copper for yourself.",

Vocals and guitar recorded over a 2track beat. I typically throw a Waves L2 on my master, just to bring up the level for the rough bounce, never doing much more than a dB or two of gain reduction. In this case I had the threshold of the L2 set at -3.4. The producer said try -3.5, then back to -3.4, then -3.5\u2026 flipping back and forth seeing what he liked more. I couldn\u2019t hear a difference. (I should say that we weren\u2019t in a well treated room, working on some mid sized genelecs. It\u2019s a  setup neither of us is super familiar with.) He decided -3.4 was better and I was in disbelief that he could even hear a difference. I asked if I could do a blind test to see if he could tell which setting was which. He closed his eyes and I switched back and forth a bunch of times before landing on a setting, and he called it correct three times in a row. He said he could hear something in the kick drum but couldn\u2019t explain more than that.\nI need a sanity check. I know my ears aren\u2019t hall of fame, but I\u2019m still in disbelief that he was able to tell a .1dB difference in volume on the limiter.",

But on this topic, I find it hard/impossible to completely 100% enjoy a piece of work after the artist has done something disagreeable, taken a public downfall or occasionally if I had a negative personal experience with them. Even though I might intellectually appreciate the beauty of the work, my heart just feels a slight bit of ick -- akin to that feeling of trying to enjoy a meal that you know is super delish but you burned your tongue on a hot cup of coffee the day before. So I\u2019ll just end up choosing to listen to something else instead. This also makes me intensely appreciate my past experiences with the art. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever enjoy it the same way again but I\u2019m so glad I was able to completely enjoy Puff Daddy productions, R. Kelly songs, Woody Allen\u2019s movies, Bill Cosby\u2019s comedy, and Kanye West\u2019s early albums when they were coming out and having their day.

Sold my car, got rid of my apartment, and flew out to Melbourne. Band had a moment but I got tossed out just as the song was going number 1. Had no money to get home, no where to stay, and was literally 23 living on our producers couch in a country about as far from home as possible. And I called my pop, basically telling him how bummed/scared/fucked I was. And he goes \u201cyou know, I just got off the phone with **** (a very famous actor friend of ours). If there\u2019s anyone that had it all, you\u2019d think it was him. Big career, wife on the cover of sports illustrated swimsuit edition, fans everywhere. But it turns out his Dad just passed, his wife is cheating on him, and if this new show doesn\u2019t get picked up they might lose the house they just bought. EVERYONE has their share of crap they have to deal with, give or take, no matter how easy it looks from the outside. Life isn\u2019t about what happens to you, it\u2019s about how you deal with what happens to you. Figure out a way to make the most of what\u2019s going on\u201d. For some reason, knowing that EVERYONE\u2019s life sucks to some degree, was immensely helpful in getting me back on my feet.\n\nThe other was a year or two later, when I started tuning vocals for Rob Cavallo. One of his wrecking crew of session musicians had been in a band with a huge hero of mine, who had sadly took his own life mid way through making his second record. I asked the guy if there was anything he could tell me about working with said hero, and he said \u201che was the best musician I\u2019ve ever met. Whatever instrument you played he was better at it than you were within 10 minutes of picking it up. But he seemed to think he was the only guy that ever got a raw deal from the music industry\u201d.",

This is why I think he\u2019s likely to catch an L . \n\nEven the new clips release is being met with , okay you\u2019re 50 and still rapping about coke ? \n\n\u2026.there an element of corny creeping in as the genre ages \n\nOn the flip side, I think a whole new genre is gonna happen soon .

I have around 15 years of experience but I've had long dry spells of doing next to nothing while focusing on my career (and partying and wasting time in my 20's). The realization of how much I fucking love producing and mixing has hit me as part of my mid life crisis and I'm ready to do something about it. I want experience and I think I have something to offer. ISO: artists who would be willing to give me a try or just let me practice with their stuff. Willing to work for free, especially if I'm excited/passionate about the project. Also open to just practicing with peoples stems that have already been worked. Advice/ideas of where to go, welcome. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc super excited to be part of this group so thanks again for the warm welcome and great energy. After many hours of listening to the podcast... I'd expect nothing less.",

We re-send to mastering and artist asks me to pull producer off CC\u2026I\u2019ve dealt with this before, but the producer has specifically asked me multiple times to make sure HE gets his word in before the artist approves masters.

Not sure what the answer is. Feel like it's lose-lose. But maybe not? Would love to hear what other people do in these situations",

I\u2019ve had many wins, but going a long period without financial wins has made me question the judgement I have when navigating everything.\n\n\u201cWinning\u201d to me is a culmination of things that can be summed up as living authentically while positively contributing to the world and lives of others. It helps fight of the tendrils of negativity I feel coming from so many angles of the outside world, especially in the last decade.\n\nI don\u2019t exactly know what I\u2019m asking. Or want. I\u2019m looking to process these feelings and synthesize them into a new level of awareness as I move forward with what I\u2019ve learned being integrated into my subconscious.\n\nSometimes being around others, or hearing their experiences and takes, helps me get angles of things in a way that I can piece together for a rough draft of what will become the lesson that I carry with me moving forward, regarding this topic at this time.",

I used to teach at a music production school where I had to teach DAWs and related concepts to beginners from the ground up and it dramatically improved my own understanding of the fundamentals because I was being asked questions by students that illuminated every single thing that I didn't fully understand. Taking the time to teach is a great way to firm up your own understanding.\n\nI frequently talk to myself and explain things out loud like I'm speaking to someone else. In fact ten minutes ago I *just* explained discipline out loud like I was speaking to my (nonexistent) stubborn child. It forces me to find an elegant approach and make sure I truly understand what I think I know.",

This is complete minutia but you all include track order numbers in your session file names and bounces for mixing/producing projects? It seems tough because these things can change last minute but also I find it nice to include the info when there is a defined order. For mastering folks, do you have a favorite way to receive info about the track sequence (i.e. each track gets a number in front of it, separate PDF with this info, email message)?",
