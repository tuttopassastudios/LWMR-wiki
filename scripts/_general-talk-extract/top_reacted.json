Even if there isn\u2019t a solid goal in mind. When you do things, you learn things.\"\n\nBig love to @hendrick and @1ggy who were the first ones involved to help make this place happen. I'm so proud of all of you for helping keep this community thriving. You all put kindness and curiosity and patience first, and THAT is what makes this place special. An island in the sea of fuckery that is the internet. I appreciate you all, my friends!",

During my paternity leave, my creative outlets were cooking, and photography. \n\nPhotos are great cause you can snag a moment and then come back to it later to edit, cooking more difficult cause it takes time you might not always have. \n\nWell in typical captial C Creative fashion, i dug deep into it. I did a LOT of research and made some purchases and practiced a lot. Got some beautiful photos and captured some important memories. Really grateful for it. \n\nAll that\u2019s just backstory to say- everywhere else on the internet SUCKS. \n\nReddit, Facebook, anywhere there are communities of people who are \u201ctrying to help,\u201d it\u2019s just full of tone deaf assholes with little info and a lot of bullshit to spew. And even the smart ones are 99% of the time tactless. \n\nGuys & girls, thank you for still being here. Best water cooler in the world: LWMR. \n\nAlso I wish we had a photography channel.",

    "content": "Today I got a reminder of how important love and care are in what we do. Just wanna give a shoutout to @Nomograph Mastering for all the wisdom shared here on that topic.\n\nLong story short \u2014 I agreed to mix a track for an American rapper who had already been turned down by some A-list mixers, even though the guy had a decent budget. The reason was kinda obvious: he\u2019s got a personality that leans toward OCD, with everything that comes with that \u2014 defensive tone in convos, super long mix notes, and weird stuff like thinking a file sounds different just because it was renamed. (I forgot to label one file as \u201cref. limited\u201d like the previous versions, and even though it was literally the exact same file, he swore the \u201cnon-limited\u201d one had a different top end.)\n\nStuff like that made me seriously consider walking away from the project like the others did \u2014 I could just feel the back-and-forth drama coming. But after my first instinct, I remembered a lot of what\u2019s been talked about here: love, care, and being open to the music and the art. So I decided to try empathy instead of just being a jerk out of frustration.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. After taking a bit of time to really talk to him and show I genuinely wanted to help \u2014 not just as a mixer, but as a human \u2014 I learned he\u2019s totally burnt out and running on fumes 'cause he just became a dad. And I totally get that, since my first kid was born a month ago too. That connection shifted the whole vibe. The next round of notes actually made sense, and we ended up approving the first mix by version 4 \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad at all. Happy client, job done.\n\nNot saying you should hang onto toxic clients, but it was a solid reminder: don\u2019t always go with your first reaction. Sometimes just showing a little care  about the person on the other side can change everything. It did for me this time. And tbh, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve handled it this way if I hadn\u2019t read some of the stuff shared here. So thanks, y\u2019all. This place is gold.",

Supposedly as many as 50% of people don't have an inner monologue. \n\nIt never occurred to me that people wouldn't, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised. My mind's eye is pretty lo-res, while some of my friends have the ability to visualize very detailed imagery in their heads.\n\nNow I'm curious. Who here has an internal monologue and who does not?\n\nGimme a \ud83d\udc4d if you do have an internal monologue.\nGimme a \ud83d\udc4e if you don't have one.",

Stop spending all your time analyzing how not to suck and just go out and suck. And then suck again. And then suck again, but a little bit less. And just bake into the equation that you\u2019ll suck for probably 50-100 songs. Because every success is built on a ton of previous sucking. Even Michael Jordan got cut from his highschool basketball team cause he sucked. But no one got worse at something the more they did it. You\u2019re not supposed to be good at something right away. You\u2019re supposed to suck, until you finally don\u2019t. But you get to the suck less phase by actually sucking lots.",

The @moderators have had a long-running discussion about the risk of a scam happening in the sales channel. As the server continues to scale, it\u2019s only a matter of time and is the last thing we want to have happen. \n\nWe\u2019ve decided to restrict the sales channel to members who have been here 3 months or more and have been regularly active on the server. New members will no longer see the channel and will have to request access from one of the mods once they\u2019ve been here longer than 3 months and have established themselves on the server. We\u2019ve been looking for a bot that will help us automate this, but out of an abundance of caution, this was the simplest (free-est) solution for now.",

It ended up being a major positive because I was able to say yes to several things that came up since (which included two of the coolest opportunities I\u2019ve had all year, one with producing for a new fav artist of mine and the other with a band I listened to a ton as a kid). And everyone was so glad I was able to be as flexible as I was and make things happen with full dedication at short notice. \n\nAll in all, hitting those scary moments where you\u2019re broke and unbooked can be a rock solid motivator, and somehow yet again the universe is looking out for me.

He said.\u201d did you look me up?\u201d I said no I just texted you like I was asked. He said.\u201d you should look me up.\u201d he proceeded to tell me  he\u2019s been signed to major label  for 25 years. Supposedly Warner brothers and followed with they gave him $600 to mix this album which then I said I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t help you.. he said \u201csend me a number of someone who can mix a jazz album.\u201d I sent him to a friend who I know it was hurting for work.. then he text me back about five minutes later and said this guy never mixed a jazz album before. Send me  somebody who mixed a jazz album preferably over 40. I sent him Al Schmitt\u2019s contact and he responded to me. \u201cAll has  been dead for several years get with it man.\u201d\n\nthere\u2019s nothing to be learned here.",

    "content": "...completely unrelated to anything  but on my mind this morning\n\nSomething I've said here (maybe too) often is that approaching the work in a loving way is a real unlock. Love being a quaity of a attention, a way of meeting things. It might not be obvious but it can start small and grow out embracing many more aspects of what we do\n\nI mastered an album a few months back for a phenomenal indie artist, @Rob Domos and I both absolutely loved the music and the overall experience. The artist's team came back this week with a last minute request to remaster what was probably my favorite track with an added feature from a legacy artist. It's kind of mind bending how much better it is\n\nRob and I spent some time yesterday just appreciating that someone (the artist, manager, A&R?) actually thought up the idea of this feature and made it happen. I was so content with what it was but someone somewhere was like *\"you know what would be sick ...\"* and made it real. And now the world gets to receive something beyond what we could have imagined, something we didn't even know we needed\n\nJust focussing our attention on that for 2 mins in the hall yesterday made the day better and put some gas in the tank. There are so many challenges in what we do, it really helps to take time to focus attention on the jewels strewn everywhere too. They are not always immediately obvious",
