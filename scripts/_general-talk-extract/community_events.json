This is the only place many of us have \u2013 on the internet or otherwise \u2013 that is a healthy, supportive, *non-political* community. We're nearly 2000 people and I fucking love browsing the depth and breadth of conversation on here. There's real love for music and creativity and camaraderie, and it brings me immense joy.\n\nSo to the newbies and experts, the casual lurkers and Grammy-winning essayists, from the bottom of my heart, thank you all. \u2764\ufe0f",

It\u2019s cool to see the beginnings of a community happen. I\u2019m getting all these creative ideas just thinking about what\u2019s possible. It\u2019s also a testament to just DOING things. Even if there isn\u2019t a solid goal in mind. When you do things, you learn things.\"\n\nBig love to @hendrick and @1ggy who were the first ones involved to help make this place happen. I'm so proud of all of you for helping keep this community thriving. You all put kindness and curiosity and patience first, and THAT is what makes this place special. An island in the sea of fuckery that is the internet. I appreciate you all, my friends!",

No more brilliant posts lost forever in the torrent of people talking about Topping DACs or asking for a collab channel.

    "content": "...completely unrelated to anything  but on my mind this morning\n\nSomething I've said here (maybe too) often is that approaching the work in a loving way is a real unlock. Love being a quaity of a attention, a way of meeting things. It might not be obvious but it can start small and grow out embracing many more aspects of what we do\n\nI mastered an album a few months back for a phenomenal indie artist, @Rob Domos and I both absolutely loved the music and the overall experience. The artist's team came back this week with a last minute request to remaster what was probably my favorite track with an added feature from a legacy artist. It's kind of mind bending how much better it is\n\nRob and I spent some time yesterday just appreciating that someone (the artist, manager, A&R?) actually thought up the idea of this feature and made it happen. I was so content with what it was but someone somewhere was like *\"you know what would be sick ...\"* and made it real. And now the world gets to receive something beyond what we could have imagined, something we didn't even know we needed\n\nJust focussing our attention on that for 2 mins in the hall yesterday made the day better and put some gas in the tank. There are so many challenges in what we do, it really helps to take time to focus attention on the jewels strewn everywhere too. They are not always immediately obvious",

I crushed it on a deadline, then that same A&R hired me a year later to work on a band called Emblem 3 who was on X Factor US as well. I crushed that and then six months after that he recommended me to a UK A&R who was having trouble finishing a song for One Direction. I did a spec production on the song Best Song Ever and they liked it and used it and all of a sudden I become a big pop producer.

That reorientation alone has changed my life in ways I can\u2019t even begin to calculate. More so than just helping me transition from indie music to major (which is huge on its own) it\u2019s helped in the transition out of adolescence and into adulthood. Certainly a top 5 most impactful thing of the last decade for me. My future kids will be better off emotionally because I\u2019m better able to redirect them because of this discord. I really have no idea how far the impact ripples. \n\nWriting this while QCing a song by an artist I\u2019ve listened to for a decade singing about all of the people along the way who supported his success and how it would have been impossible without his community. Feels pretty emotional tbh",

If that were the case me and a lot of the folks here would be complete losers, but we\u2019re not. We\u2019re actually better for having worked on things that we\u2019d never share willingly.\nIs this really a reason to bail? I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t. But aesthetics are really subjective. Are you saying your finger\u2019s on the pulse of your generation\u2019s aesthetic taste? Is there room for differences? Also, it sounds like your friend wrote the songs and is the frontman, and you are producing, playing bass, and mixing. Why are you so attached to the visual aspect of it when your role is more support rather than the face of the project?",

I would challenge you to reflect on where you started 2025 and where you are now and take inventory of what growth or lessons you experienced. \n\nThe most rewarding bits of this year for me wouldn\u2019t make sense to post about. Paid off my first business loan. Improved the efficiency of signal flow in my studio. Learned to fix some gear. Stood up for myself in a hard conversation with some assholes trying to rip me off. Got out of the UAD ecosystem. \n\nNone of that I\u2019m posting about or adding to a playlist, but it feels just as essential (or more) to my business than the songs that got released.",

That\u2019s niching down a little too hard a little too early.\n\nI think it\u2019s our job to find the essence within something and maximally bring that essence out. Often these \u201ctaste mismatch\u201d issues come across to me as missing that essence within the thing you\u2019re working on and trying to make it something that it essentially isn\u2019t. ie. A wannabe Max Martin working with a wannabe mitski and the producer complaining that the artist\u2019s suggestions are making the production hashy and the artist complaining that the producer\u2019s production choices don\u2019t convey enough emotion. \n\nIt\u2019s talking past each-other and not really collaborating. You aren\u2019t learning to truly love what your partner loves, which IMO is frankly a big part of the job.",

The writer made mention of people they called \"geniuses of everyday living.\"\n\nThey were referring to the uncelebrated people among us who may be living quiet lives of private accomplishment. Not chasing after lofty or conspicuous goals, or a grand ambition. Perhaps these people are satisfied raising a family, or existing in their community to the best of their ability. Or perhaps they are absorbed in a far more humble pursuit and are completely satisfied in their day-to-day efforts.\n\nThat sounds like something to aspire to.

I loved the energy and think it will meet some super motivated subset of people in it's audeince that are pumped by it\n\nI've done projects from complete bootstrap lifters, to \"working class\" & \"organic\" label signings to trust fund kids.

Producers moreso than mixers.\n\nWhen I find a record that resonates with me I'm very full-immersion and I'll devour as much of their adjacent body of work as I can. I'll start scrutinizing the record credits and pulling on threads as I see them. I really try to fill in the context around the record by identifying all collaborators, timelines, interviews they gave around that time, published works, etc. I've got a huge appetite for that thing.\n\nI really love reading books written by producers. The more old school the better. Phil Ramone's *Making Records* is a great one. That guy is a class act. Quincy Jones has both an autobiography *and* a book specifically on producing. The latter is a great no-shortcuts look at what it takes to be great. I enjoyed Daniel Lanois' *Soul Mining*, since he's got a very thoughtful immersive way of making records and working with artists that I appreciate.",

There\u2019s a camaraderie and kinship in physical labour on construction projects, and an embodied intelligence in that world that offsets the subjective and (for me) atomised work of hours alone mixing.\n\nWhen I\u2019m doing construction work, I\u2019m also free to think objectively and from a distance about my audio engineering work.\n\nMost of all, something changes for me when I\u2019m being paid for musical \u201cwork\u201d that I\u2019m not entirely happy with. I\u2019ve discussed this privately with a few folks here, and it seems the relationship between music and its commodification is problematic for more than a few of us. Simply put, it\u2019s sometimes less enjoyable \u2014 though equally amazing \u2014 being paid for a passion.\n\nI couldn\u2019t recommend a construction or skilled trade career enough. It\u2019s incredibly flexible and offers a tonic to music careers: you know you can walk onto a site tomorrow and get paid quickly and well. It\u2019s always going to be around, and in my case, the certifications allow me to consider migrating to most economies globally as a skilled worker.\n\nConstruction allows me to be my own patron for my musical endeavours, and that feels really good.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a bigger debate here about how working in the upper echelons of the music industry feels long term \u2014 challenges, payoffs, economics, job security, retirement, healthcare, family life versus work life, and a world where socialising is networking.\n\nConstruction is a simpler engagement: competency, find a solution, do the work, go home.\n\nI came across @cian riordan discussing becoming a fireman on Conversations, and much of what you said, Cian, is exactly what I get from construction.\n\nI love how for you, though \u2014 instead of the firehouse bell calling, it was multiple Grammys!",

(obviously outliers exist)\n\nI've literally seen art save lives. mental and emotional health is a necessity and music (even sound in general) I find is a key element. \n\na ridiculous amount of cultures (read:indigenous) placed immense value on the art in their culture..often as part of their spiritual beliefs. even colonists co-opted and modified songs to allow conquests though culture more easily.\n\nI think accessibility makes us think art isn't a necessity. it is. a lot of us would probably have lost our minds at this point (and I've seen that happen) if we didn't have it to lean on for various aspects. I'm not saying it should be #1 priority but I do think the inherent value we (the world) give art can directly affect how we value other things \n\nit's also the source of community and support for a lot of people and we are community based beings at our core  (though we can seperate to some extent).\n\nthe mindset things is also v interesting. being from Haiti I see American payment mindsets and European (a lot of both out there) and there's also more traditional ones that are more based in community - usually ones that survived colonialism to some extent. see:taino culture (mostly survived in pr, almost non existent in the other islands now). those are more focused on everyone getting there part fairly. the work is for the community not for yourself. while juxtaposition w the other mindset has flipped some folks' wayof working a lot of them are fine as is.\n\nthere's  o clear solution to the value of art thing. diff fields and different positions have to find ways of presenting value but I see that as a Consequence of the mentality we've adopted not a solution",

One example would be this, someone comes in fresh expecting you to spoon feed them the knowledge, that\u2019s not super helpful. But someone comes in and can say, \u201coh that\u2019s a Patchbay, can you show me how it works\u201d. You can teach those people anything. The desire and hunger to learn on their own and the ability to acquire knowledge for themselves has been a huge divide I\u2019ve noticed in the intern/ college community.  \n\nOne time we were setting up a session and I was explaining to our intern my thoughts about which headphones we\u2019d give to each station. (This pair has better bass, we\u2019ll give them to the bass player. These are open back we\u2019ll give them to the horn section so they can blend better) The very next session without having to mention it, she had placed the same headphones in the same places AND ALSO she then took that info and made a the judgement that we\u2019d give the nicest most comfy pair to the vocalist. That\u2019s what I mean about extrapolation.",

You observe the long legs, the muscles, the skin, the eyes, the respiratory system, etc. You see it's strengths and you see it's weaknesses and you draw your conclusions from there. This would be the top-down learning approach. It's good at describing what already *is*. \n\nOr...\n\n2) You build/design a frog from scratch. You will quickly come to understand why things *have* to be the way they are. You realize that all of the evolutionary \"choices\" about a frog's physiology are simply the best possible compromises, given the pressures of the environment, the availability of resources, and the limits of physics. By building it yourself you will come to perceive all of the invisible challenges and \"solved\" problems that were required to make an organism that will simply survive, much less thrive.\n\nThis firsthand experience of building the thing will actually make you an expert because you've done the hard work and experienced it for yourself. You took ten paths to failure and made every mistake before settling on a a non-obvious compromise that allows you to balance it against every other factor. You understand *why* it needs to be that way.\n\nThis knowledge will make you robust and flexible, whereas top-down knowledge is more superficial and brittle. If the conditions of your subject change and the model you understand is no longer relevant then you're in a far more precarious place than someone who's built something from the ground up.",

To use your analogy, dating a new girl feels different than a year in, vs. being married, vs. having a family. It's absolutely normal for the type of love you have for music to evolve over time and repetition.\n\nI kind of doubt that earning money from music is the root cause of your feelings. But it might be affecting how you encounter music. If it's all feeling too ordinary, then break the ordinary. Go listen to live music that's far away from anything you touch. Pick up an instrument you don't know how to play and get in a room with some friends and enjoy being bad, but exploring music like a child. \n\nThe \"quitting\" thing often feels like something often born out of rough working experiences, or perhaps just too mundane. Bills have to get paid (burgers gotta get flipped) but perhaps you can balance those gigs with things that challenge and excite you, even if they're not particularly lucrative. \n\ntl;dr I think we all go through phases of questioning if the career is worth it, if not questioning our relationship with music itself, but in my experience, almost everyone comes out the other side after a bit of a mental reset.",

In my experience a big part of true collaboration is having to let go of some control of some parts of the whole thing.  Just putting out there you might be walking away from something really cool in the early stages because of a desire to control every aspect of the project.  It sounds like there are a lot of people that care a lot about the project to invest their time and energy and taste into it.\n\nAgain - you know everything you are feeling and the dynamics and if it's not worth it to you then absolutely walk away.  But maybe worth it to try and make the best of it for another few months and see where it leads?  If you are worried about how other people perceive the marketing/instagram can't you just explain you don't have anything to do with that end of the project?",

I think I had mentioned this in a previous post, but these days notes tend to come in real time -- via text messages, dropbox comments, or sometimes even thoughtful emails. I'll usually take a quick glance, but then dump everything into a note file so I have everything in one place when I sit to do the revision. This can be useful when you'll get a thread of notes like 1) I'm not sure about the drum sound, it feel so x... then 2) someone else will chime in saying I love the drums! I think x is the problem then 3) first person is hesitant and shrugs of their not, even though it may still bother them. That way I can try and string together some sort of move that will hopefully make everyone happy. If you're dealing with a band -- and you're producing/engineering -- you'll have had the benefit of seeing the dynamic. Sometimes you get some people that are more engaged and tweaky, others that are unsure of EVERYTHING, and then people that when they say something, they're usually right, as infrequent as that may be. This is very useful during mix notes time because you have context. If you're just getting flies flown to you and you've never met the band/artist, thats certainly a bit more of a challenge and will likely require more work on your end to smooth things out.",

England had had breakbeat hardcore for a few years already (eg . Early early prodigy ) and then the British carribean community and others familiar with reggae and particularly the early 90s ragga scene in Jamaica , started fusing ragga acapellas and dub bass line motifs with hardcore \u2018s drum breaks .

The most meaningful collaborations I've had have been from me producing work that earns the respect and appreciation of my peers. The work itself is the alignment optimizer and the collaboration has almost always been downstream of that. I think its much harder to find alignment with 100 cold calls (which I've also tried). I think looking for a balance between producing music you really love and are proud of and cultivating a network of potential artists you would want to collaborate with is a good way of being. Which might be exactly what you're doing. Idk without more context.\n\nCould be helpful to think of it like a conversation and maybe you need to make the first move. Have you tried commenting on other artists work you come across online that you find compelling? Not in a spammy juice the numbers kinda way but more of a conscious attitude towards how you choose to travel online. I see that all the time leading to collaboration between artists.",

Well it's because fundamentally those songs are about rebellion and not being understood by society. They're about celebrating your unique place in this world. Authentic struggle and challenges that you overcome through whatever means you have available. Every teenager in the world feels that way.",

    "content": "I went to help a fellow engineer buddy record some drums today at his studio, and it made me think of something Jon Castelli said on the Conversations or LWMR podcast - he challenged the idea of being out of your comfort zone to grow, and look at the Benefits of the comfort zone.\n\nMy buddy is a great engineer and great drummer in a great and, so all great things. But his setup was just incredibly different than mine; he uses Studio One, I use pro tools (he\u2019s also used to Pro tools and recently bailed on it). He\u2019s using a combo of Antelope Discrete 8 and an Audient ASP880 and some good outboard pres (Vintech and Summit audio). His monitoring killed me, some small dynaudios which sounded okay and some ProAc\u2019s. He had some decent mics. I brought my 8 Channels of UTA and a bunch of mics and was there just to put our heads together, and I was going mostly press record so he could drum for his bands record.\n\nAnyway, we spent about 4+ hours trouble shooting Studio One, his computer, and the interfaces -eventually finding out one of his AD/DA channels was so messed up it sounded like a ribbon mic when it was a condenser. A lot of his mic stands and cables were really junky - he didn\u2019t have enough of the basics on his own.\n\nSo many things were just not working as I would expect - my UTA preamps were set at much lower gains than I do at my studio because of his gear. I\u2019m basically ear-blind because of the monitoring, even with headphones, and I\u2019m working in Studio One so I can barely focus on the sound. And he used a normal Apple mouse, I use a trackball. \n\nIm trying not to complain, but it just blew my mind how much of an uphill battle recording can be just because of simple things being so taxing. We spent about an hour of the 6 hours I was there tracking one song. The rest was setup. It made me realize why we put so much work into making our process simple and getting gear that is effective and reliable.",

This year is the *Year of Intuition and Sensuality*.\n\nThe *intuition* aspect means that whenever an opportunity arises to do something I will challenge myself to dive right in and intuitively feel my way through it, rather than taking an overhead approach and charting everything out before I act. Don't second-guess. Just go for it.\n\nI'm exceedingly good at planning and analysis, but I'm less comfortable with simply diving headfirst into something, getting messy, and figuring it out as I go. So this year is about me identifying opportunities to do so and hack away without premeditation (I've already got that in spades). Throw myself in and then dig myself out. It's a muscle I want to flex so that I can be more ambidextrous in my approach to situations.\n\nThe *sensuality* half is about being more in touch with my body. It's less about health or fitness and more about observing my body and following the sensations. Being more sensual. Whether it's exploring feelings of touch, scent, or flavor. Being attuned to how my body feels when I sing. Or how an instrument through an amp resonates in my body. Following those instincts. Dancing more. Anything that might fall under that umbrella.",

Making a career in the music industry is what engineers would call a \"wicked\" problem. It's not something that has a repeatable solution, and what works for someone rarely works the same way for the next person.\n\nThat said, I see that you\u2019re from Boston. I lived there for seven years, and the talent pool in that city is tremendous. I think if you found yourself back home in Boston it would be a worthwhile investment to integrate yourself into the scene of young musicians that are centered around the schools in the Back Bay like Berklee, NEC, and Boston Conservatory. There are some immensely talented, diverse, and creative people from all around the world based at those institutions and they all exist within 8 blocks of each other. It\u2019s rare to have such a concentration of driven musicians all mingling amongst each other. This is a massive resource that you can tap into. They're *all* trying to make something great and explore what's possible.\n\nIt's a unique opportunity to discover collaborators, build relationships, earn experience in your craft, and build strong connections for the future as you grow alongside these people. On top of that, Boston has numerous recording studios where you can intern and assist. There\u2019s a lot of experience to be gained working in a studio that simply won\u2019t be taught to you in a recording program. Supplement that practical experience with hard work, and some book learning and you can do very well for yourself.\n\nThere\u2019s more that I\u2019m not touching-on, but I think if you ended up back in Boston it not be as much as a trade-off as you may think.",

    "content": "Yes. The same way you do anything in life you want to get good at. Spend a shit load of time doing that thing. There really are no hacks or work arounds if you want to actually get good. An easy free way to do it is just learn as many songs as you can. If you want to really be proficient in the musical language I would recommend learning stuff by ear. It takes a lot longer than looking up tutorials or sheet music. But I promise you will develop your ears infinitely more. Specially in the beginning. Music is a language. Every human being learns to speak and converse before they learn how to spell and know the rules of grammar. Learning theory will only let you put names to sounds so that you can convey musical ideas to their people. Contrary to what a lot of people think, there are no rules, but there are a lot of conventions and traditions, but they keep changing and have lots of exceptions. Learning a shit ton of songs on whatever instrument you choose, will teach you what those conventions are and how to use them. \n\nIn the beginning it\u2019s good to just learn every song you like as well as you can, because it will help keep you motivated as you like the music. Then after a while you will probably want to branch out and try stuff you\u2019ve never listened to or enjoyed before just to challenge yourself. \n\nThe most musical people I know, are the people who wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a Caugmented#9 but can listen to a song once and play it nearly perfectly, because their ears and musical language is so developed from playing a fuck lot of music and not spending time reading about it or watching endless tutorials.",

    "content": "Wellllll, as the person who asked the opening question , re: marketing and perceived value, it did seem to open up a broad discussion with a lot of varied input . Wherever it got into any perceived sense of entitlement , was off track as the core of the question was about leveraging and better pay/benefits for the successful elite (nothing to do with people striving to get there ) . It wasn\u2019t a question about working hard.....or having talent......or how to share a pie and how much pie there is ......that\u2019s all a given in the original discussion I referenced that was between two Grammy winning engineers.  It was a discussion about marketing and the idea of engineers  leveraging for more as a community looking forwards . One  platform was mentioned here earlier that I have experience with.......and they are definitely driving value down with their marketing.  Through the history of time workers have had to fight for more (pay/benefits/better working conditions / contracts ) and imho that\u2019s a legitimate and beneficial force in society. Noam Chomsky describes a point at which society collapses is when the imbalance of the societal structure is such that the vast majority of the workforce can no longer afford to live . In the uk we are currently experiencing strikes across many services/industries. It\u2019s not really my way to say if they are write or wrong ......but I think the concept of unionising and leveraging for \u201cfairer/better :::::whatever you like \u201c is legitimate not entitled or moany  . The suffragettes did it ......I digress. I think IME it\u2019s a fair observation that people employed on the business side of the music business in the big music companies in the  uk work with the expectation that this will result in take home regular pay, without fear of non-payment , working with full benefits re\u2019 holiday pay , maternity pay , etc etc.......",

    "content": "I've got a question for the crew that hopefully will lead to some interesting discussion but honestly could use some outside perspective here.\n\nHow important is it that we as collaborators come to a consensus on what feels good for the production of a song? Let's say you as a producer are not vibeing with the artist's direction / vision for a song, but the artist feels very passionate about their vision. You help them realize their vision all the way through and it still doesn't feel good to you or any other involved party other than the artist. What then?\n\nI'm curious to hear some thoughts on the producer's perspective and the artist's perspective. To paint the extremes a little bit; at what point does being disagreeable as a producer (when dictated by your own taste / gut / intuition) become a hindrance to the project or unprofessional? And for the artist at what point are you getting in your own way so to speak and diminishing the potential outside contribution from collaborators that could level up your work?",

Like when the artist asked for a wetter vocal, we don\u2019t just crank the verb right? We make sure it\u2019s not causing problems mucking up transients etc. same with instrumentation and all. \n2) it\u2019s the artist we\u2019re serving. So when we\u2019re done and have gotten paid, they\u2019re the ones who have to go out and tour it, promote it, share it with they\u2019re moms and kids and SOs etc. They need to be happy with it. \n3) if we can\u2019t make 1 happen, we make 2 happen and move on to the next one. \n\nGenerally I find the more I\u2019m able to serve the artist\u2019s vision, over time the trust grows and they become more interested and even reliant on consensus. But there are always outliers songs and outlier clients and outlier collaborators and outlier artists. \n\nIn the long run, ain\u2019t we all just tryna get it right?",

Many creative pursuits are sullied by people wanting to be agreeable to avoid the difficult challenges and conflict that can come with trying to achieve something specific and great. Clarity of mission, buy-in to a vision and alignment on desired outcome are paramount.",

But I\u2019d basically frame it as it can\u2019t be a career and won\u2019t be a career until you build d the numbers. Being an artist is being a business owner. Except it\u2019s more like owning a business that invests its money in slot machines. \n\nHis first step is gonna be writing 100 songs. Because they\u2019re all gonna be not that great. I think it\u2019s important to instill the idea of not being precious with your art early on because I think we all spent way too long on that one song when we were 18 and it was awful anyway. \n\nThen he needs to connect with other people with the same goals as him. Find or build a community. Play shows as often as possible and see how people react to your music. Save up the little bit of money for studio time. \n\nAfter doing that for like a year or two start recording and keep networking.",

In some cases, even the intended audience. with that said, if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. \n\n/ might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it. \n\nso who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. \n\nthis is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world. but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

My two cents: if there isn\u2019t a designated producer in the room and you\u2019re fulfilling both the engineer/producer roles then trying to get from load in to recording as quickly as possible seems to work well - that way they can be witness and collaborator to any sonic changes. Like someone was talking about a producer who just dampened the toms right away - maybe that was necessary but if the artist hasn\u2019t heard both options in the same room on the same song then they\u2019re left with nothing but faith that this is the right decision. But if you just start recording quickly and then chime in with \u201chey, I feel like maybe the toms are ringing out for too long, can we try dampening them on this next take?\u201d They\u2019re probably more likely to try it out.",

If they don\u2019t HAVE one, then they don\u2019t need feedback. I doubt anyone collaborating is often denying a response or feedback from another party. \n\nNot to mention, if a lot of people respond to something positivity or negatively, a consensus is built - usually around culture. Radio Pop music is popular because it\u2019s approachable and simple (or appears to be) based on what our society has built into.\n\nI\u2019ll just stop here, this is an endless discussion.

I\u2019m not quite in LA, my move there is next month end of September, but CoL in San Diego is nearly identical to LA in most ways. Once I put my shit into an excel spreadsheet and did the math on \u201cthis is break even; this is what it looks like if I go out every once and a while; this is what it looks like if I\u2019m off my rocker with my credit card\u201d I could put rather definitive numbers on things and it gave me peace of mind.\n\nAs for more of the how: I think gaming the roommate system is your best bet. I\u2019m moving into a two bedroom place with my roommate/collaborator as well as my long time girlfriend. If you can find a way to split a bedroom, that\u2019s gonna help. 2 bed room houses for rent aren\u2019t that bad if you\u2019re willing to sit down with a drink or two on Zillow for a few nights and really figure out your living area. I\u2019ve found places for the $2300 in East LA and Pasadena. Splitting that and other key living expenses (we plan to have a few nights where we eat together and we\u2019ll sorta rotate meal ideas, that way everyone\u2019s not shelling out super ridiculous individual grocery charges) among 3 people each month is fairly easy so long as we hustle well.",

They're controlling the parameters at a meta level and are steering their patches. They jam and improvise and capture then they edit it into something coherent if necessary.\n\nBut not always. Sometimes they get into the weeds and give it the expert painter's touch too. They've got a collaborative relationship with their tools.",

While my end goals are more modest, I recognize that for me it will inevitably take longer to get there. \n\nEven though I come from the artist perspective, I thoroughly enjoy lurking the conversations here.

Is this sustainable long term for musicians? Can you balance that much time given to your art and then even more to finding your audience?  Its an open question in my mind, partly born from having seen how musicians and djs in my community in London have quietly built lifelong careers in UKG and Drum n Bass on the back of pure devotion to their crafts and not so much pouring even more effort into self promotion. \nIts an alternative approach imho, that has now delivered a good few of them to a balanced, apparently affluent lifestyle in their 50s. Balanced as in, found the time to have children and build a private life with family as well as pursue a music career. And still going hard on the music , same as they always did.\nWill Teddy Swims be burnt out at 50? Will he still love making music? \nThere are quicker (and legal) ways to make money that enable us to be just as creative Giving  100% of your time to anything just to have a chance at the slim odds of making a living seems unwise imho.",

The tribes spend all year hand sewing and beading their personal suits before they debut them on Mardis Gras and parade the streets. And then they do it all over again for the next year.\n\nThe amount of craft on display is stunning. There is a deep respect for tradition and community that runs throughout this city and it gives me chills being in the room with such wildly creative and meaningful creations. There's so much pride and tradition in everything that people do in this city, which is deeply inspiring. I really like it here.",

Thankfully BJJ is good for all ages, you can start at any age and still improve a ton for the entire life without a need for above-average physical strength.

Where everyone trains with everyone regardless of skill level (when covid is not a thing) and where people aren\u2019t training to feed their egos. Always talking about what happened, what could have been better going back and forth is a constructive training attitude. No shit/trash talking (unless it\u2019s a joke between close friends/training buddies), and teachers who focus on the fundamental principles of how guards work and leverages work.  Definitely recommend physical hobbies though. We\u2019re always on a chair staring at the screen for hours. Anything that involves moving all four limbs is the way to go.",

    "content": "I didn't post on instagram from 2016 - 2021, then I started actively posting again, *strictly* about audio, music, engineering, projects. I have easily gotten 10+ projects this year from doing this. It's not all my work but it's been shockingly useful. THAT SAID, it is almost entirely from people I already knew, or friends of friends. You know this, but it's an effective way to keep YOU in people's front of mind for picking someone for a job, at least for independent projects.That's what it came down to. \"Oh yeah, they are an engineer, I'll hit them up\". A lot of work has been fully completed THROUGH the instagram DM's. It's genuinely insane to me but it's worked.\n\nI think social media can and will be what you make of it. It's easy to be addicted (I definitely struggle with this) but 90% of what I am reading, ingesting, etc is all audio based. Lots of people post political stuff, news, or personal stuff and I can't entirely avoid it but for the most part I do compared to what I realize other people's feeds consist of.\n\nI think instagram has worked for me, but it certainly won't make or break your career if you don't do good work in the first place. If you currently have 0 clients, it probably won't get you more clients. I legit think I have 300 followers which is embarrassingly low. My account is private. it still has worked for me, at this juncture in my career. I also have enjoyed the community aspect of engineers on insta and discord. \n\nEvery interaction or project can lead to something new. That's why for a lot of people, saying \"yes\" to everything is the best at the beginning until you are doing so much that you have the freedom to say no.  thanks for coming to my Ted-X talk.",

As an LA native, both Culver City and Westchester would be relatively low on my list of places to live (I'm an Eastsider and prefer this side of town for a multitude of reasons that are probably not relevant), but between the two, I'd probably pick Culver City. You're just closer to stuff there and it's a little less of a bedroom community. Depending on where in Westchester, you also may be in the flight path of LAX so environmental noise should be a consideration as well. Depends what you're planning on doing here and where you or your wife need to be on a regular basis commute-wise. Both are relatively accessible but Culver City probably edges out Westchester for propensity to be jammed during rush hour.",

But getting those 10,000 hours in is a lot more fun if you are enjoying what you are doing, and not hating every second of it. You don\u2019t have to love the music, but if you hate every project you work on, I think burn out will be inevitable. I like the fact that you spun into a challenge and made it fun by using it as a way to learn even more. But let\u2019s say you wanna be a mix engineer and work on hip hop. If you spend 10,000 hours only mixing country because it\u2019s what pays. You\u2019ll probably never end up where you wanted to go",

Lead times are insane now and you are taking a risk by not pressing enough if you have the demand there.  The hardcore fans are willing to pay and often a second hand market comes up where the price skyrockets and none of the money finds its way back to the artist.\n\nBut yeah it really is a cool artifact to me, and something worth keeping alive in my opinion.",

A lot of these longer form discussions could be cool to have on the voice channels. \n\nBut adding more songwriters and producers and artists might just enrich the non-engineers channels in a beautiful way.\n\nThe @moderator s are often chatting about ways to keep the ethos of this place while it expands.

This doesn't have to be confrontational, merely voicing an opinion which is clear can cause a reaction where maybe they'll tweak the song, think about its approach dfifferently etc.  Consensus is cool but really I think a clear opinion is usually respected whether they agree or not.",

We talked about a bunch of stuff but one of the themes we explored was the idea that one needs a \u201cportfolio\u201d of slick & great sounding work to get hired\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided that then it becomes the focus, and changes the way things feel and the way decisions about time, who you work with etc get made. Concepts like \u201cI\u2019ll suck it up and work for free but *then* I will have a singular \u201cgood track\u201d for my portfolio\u201d. Of course there are exceptions but it feels to me that there\u2019s something very constricting and materialist about this way of being in the world. There can be a tension between what the artist wants or what the song wants to be and what makes you look \u201cgood\u201d in your portfolio - they want mono and grimy but you want wide/lush/impressive\n\nIn our jam I proposed a kind of thought experiment, an end of the line or extreme of the \u201cneed portfolio\u201d way of thinking\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say you are here, a young writer, producer, mixer. You\u2019ve been doing it 3 or 4 years. You feel that one of the reasons you are not getting hired, getting shots or getting paid well is that there isn\u2019t a body of work for a potential client to judge you by. Ok, here\u2019s comes the magic trick. I\u2019m going to grant you a genie wish portfolio! 5 killer tracks with  great collaborators. Not hot 100 #1 but the kind of work that you really feel would represent you best in the world. Boom. There it is\u2026\n\nSo now what? You get some DMs and sessions start happening. But you\u2019re not ready. You\u2019re not fit for game day. You\u2019re in over your head, and don\u2019t have the fluency, the experience, the reps and the humblings that build a great music business pro. In short you\u2019re not ready for the opportunities the genie wish portfolio granted you",

Music taught me this, especially playing for communal experiences such as Community Dance, Haitian Folkore Dance, and Churches.

I can definitely feel that I am unable to enter the connectedness when I\u2019m not letting it happen and trying to control things. There could be all sorts of reasons for this; fear closes all circuits out of all. \n\nI believe this is why a lot of Eastern philosophies including Buddhism and Jainism believe in vegetarianism. Because they consider things that come from living things also part of the connectedness. \n\nBut I cannot stop eating meat. It\u2019s just not viable for me \ud83d\ude02",

If I\u2019m \u201cmaking content\u201d and notice that I\u2019m doing so out of a place that is less than genuine, I will just delete and move on. \n\nFor me, the \u201cmix tips\u201d thing came out of a sincere place of excitement and passion. I would, as a growing mix engineer, stumble upon something that excited me, and I would find myself wanting to turn around to the people in the room to share\u2026well, there\u2019s almost never anyone in the room with me. So, I channeled that passion and excitement in a genuine way to share with the small community of mixers, mastering engineers and producers that I knew on IG. \n\nAt the beginning of my career on to the middle of my career, that became a very fruitful source of business for me - people who followed me on IG, who enjoyed my posts, and began to view me as someone who MIGHT know a thing or two about mixing. \n\nAs my career has developed and my clientele has growing, that has become less important, but it was absolutely pivotal in helping me build a deep bench of great clients, both indie and signed. \n\nBut\u2026I NEVER did it for that reason. It was always (and continues to be) a genuine result of my passion for what I do.",

A huge challenge for me is that being one of those you said, with a laser focus and obsession, I'm very used to doing it all myself. Initially because I purely wanted to (\"and that it's up to me\"), and subsequently because it's easier for me to do it than delegate (with all that goes into that)\nI have 2 employees at the moment - soon being 3.\nI know it's a big question - but what are your thoughts on what you so nicely put as *collaborative systems and relying on the agency of others*?",

If you don't want to be chronically online/focus more on music making you don't have to set a super interactive precedent. But there's real power in really engaging if that comes easy for you.\n\nWhen I was doing daily youtube videos and really engaged with fans we would easily sell out big batches of merch etc. Friends with bigger numbers per video, especially if they interacted less & showed less of their personalities, had much lower conversion rates even if it might look more impressive from the outside. As often comes up in this server, it can pay to go for quality over quantity of fans, especially in the long run. But again, if you establish an interaction rate that works for you, it should be possible to make it work. You may want to consider how to connect fans to each other more instead & build a community, to the extent you can with what you're putting out",

I\u2019m with you . \n\nI think what I\u2019m wondering about is \u2026..with our modern lifestyles I totally get how the consumer is listening mostly by headphones now . And we as music makers are freed up enormously by working in headphones . I think rod waves album got a Grammy and was mixed on headphones iirc, perhaps it was a number 1 . Anyhoo , so I\u2019m not contesting the movement to headphone mixing , I\u2019m wondering for those who intend to or are doing all their work on headphones \u2026..how will you know how it feels in air ? As one day , the artist will perform it live . I come from club and sound system culture , so the ultimate destination is a wall of speaker boxes \u2026..and in the end music has to be re inforced for public performance . How do we know we ve got that balance right if we don\u2019t use speakers ? (Honest question )",

I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about \u201cpoint of view\u201d when it comes to artists, and I\u2019d love to hear the community\u2019s thoughts. \n\nMost successful artists (by numbers, following, cultural impact, etc) tend to have a certain point of view. It\u2019s often somewhat broad and difficult to pinpoint  exactly what it is. Charli XCX has a song about doing cocaine at a club and a song wondering if she will run out of time to have a baby on the same album, but neither feels out of place. The Sabrina record has multiple distinct sonic landscapes within it but they feel coherent when played next to each other. \u201cSlim Pickins\u201d and \u201cBed Chem\u201d come to mind as pretty different from each other. Post Malone and Beyonc\u00e9 both went country and it seemed perfectly natural. All of these projects feel like they have a distinct point of view despite an evolving multitude of lyrical content and sonics. \n\nWhen I hear less successful artists, I often perceive a lack of a point of view. Their perspective may feel generic, it might jump around in a way that isn\u2019t coherent, or it might not be the best representation of who they are. Sometimes the music might be coming from a genuine place and is GREAT, but it doesn\u2019t quite land because the artist hasn\u2019t been able to pinpoint exactly who they are sonically/lyrically/artistically and also how exactly to bring that into the world. Sometimes their preconceptions of who they are or preoccupation with a shiny new idea can get in the way too.",

I\u2019ve seen this happen SO many times. Skating with people who blamed losing a competition on not having hollowed trucks. Competed in Street Fighter and had an opponent that blamed the country the parts of their control stick was sourced, saying \u2018If only I had ____ parts from South Korea like you\u2026\u2019\u2028\u2028It\u2019s hard to look in the mirror and go \u201cYou controlled the result. Period. No other factors. Face it. Now do what you need to improve to move forward.\u201d Externalizing seems to be what people do when they are heavily invested in something and can\u2019t surpass a plateau for X amount of time. I see it as more of a \u2018lack of personal accountability\u2019 problem, and that anyone can be greater at their callings, as long as they get out of their own way by not focusing their time on pointless comforts/compensations within their field.\n\nHopefully reflecting on this will further help me avoid time traps along the way too.",

    "content": "For sure , I completely agree with you that weight should be given to the apparent findings of rigorous work . Absolutely. I also think it is a disservice to all of us if people are discouraged to approach unpopular ideas and ask questions about them for fear of mockery . Or that newcomers simply accept dogma of the day . That is anti science . Our greatest scientific discoveries usually shatter the pre existing concencus view (for the benefit of all ) Newtonian physics gives way to relativity, classic physics to quantum etc . \nAs you will know Cian , science is not about proving  things with absolute certainty it deals in probabilities . \nScience works to bring us to a place where we can say p< 0.05 . So imho we shouldn\u2019t loosely  present science as absolute and unchanging truths in service of quietening and/ or deriding people and/or their ideas . \nImho what is being missed in so doing is that it is those who dare to challenge dogma,  who challenge and constantly review empirical evidence that bring us the new discoveries . My point is less about discrediting null tests and more about celebrating people who dare to challenge dogma . And that science is also in support of those people . If young people / newcomers are to chase a few rabbit holes and cul de sacs for the will of exploration and finding things out for themselves , who would deny them that ? Those who probably did much the same thing themselves at the start of their journey into audio ? It certainly appears to be true that under observation and current technology the daws sum. Yet we are also at a moment in science where mathematicians are suggesting our reality may only be an avatar and time as a concept is outdated . In mind of these leading edges of scientific thought someone as clever as Jon challenging a consensus on nulling may or may not be genius . But laughing at or dismissing his and Aaron\u2019s and many others sense on it \u2026..doesn\u2019t serve any of us imho .",
