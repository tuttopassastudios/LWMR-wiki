Last night I had a question about an audio routing program and multiple people that are not on my payroll, they do not work for me or owe me anything, responded not just same day but within minutes with information that helped me get to where I was trying to go.\n\nSo many producers/writers/engineers/music makers/ dreamers are going to be better off, and way further along their paths, because of the wealth of knowledge and the generosity of the people on this discord, from the most seasoned mods to the newest noobs. And it\u2019s entirely free. \n\nThanks @oaklandmatt for putting this thing together. There\u2019s always something new to learn and this is a rad place to learn it.",

And it\u2019s because he knows what to look for in a photograph, and then it\u2019s easy enough to work backwards from there. That\u2019s the skill of the whole thing. And it\u2019s such a strong parallel to watching the Machine Head collectors on gearspace or the $12k PRS blues lawyers on TGP wax poetic about gear while clearly having no idea what the gear is actually used for. \n\nFocus on the right things.",

    "content": "In the midst of a kinda unique side quest at the moment - label pulls me in at an hourly rate with an artist (and good friend) that I\u2019ve mixed for many times because the production sessions were such a mess that they felt like they couldn\u2019t even finish the records until some light mixing and organization took place. Songs spread out between multiple project files, DAWs, laptops\u2026vocals tracked to mp3s with the ~50ms delay thing\u2026Some of these producers templates\u2026brilliant stuff. Saw one vocal travel through maybe 7 or 8 auxes and hit probably 4 different rvox\u2019s along the way. It was like a labyrinth of signal flow that was nearly impossible to follow (and once I deleted half the auxes and waves plugins, it started to come back to life). In short they\u2019re having me un-mix it, hand it back for some more production, then do the final mixes later this year. A true testament to the importance of organization and more importantly minimalist, straight forward session files. I wonder how often this need comes up and how feasible it is to be involved ahead of the handoff as a mixer these days. And before you frown at me for griping, this is an absolutely incredible project, many insanely talented musicians I respect. Very right brained, free flowing group. So it felt cool to be able to play more of a part on the project as the more left brained participant and see the stress relief happen in real time.",

Just because your credits playlist isn\u2019t looking the way you\u2019d like doesn\u2019t mean that growth wasn\u2019t happening. I would challenge you to reflect on where you started 2025 and where you are now and take inventory of what growth or lessons you experienced. \n\nThe most rewarding bits of this year for me wouldn\u2019t make sense to post about. Paid off my first business loan. Improved the efficiency of signal flow in my studio. Learned to fix some gear. Stood up for myself in a hard conversation with some assholes trying to rip me off. Got out of the UAD ecosystem. \n\nNone of that I\u2019m posting about or adding to a playlist, but it feels just as essential (or more) to my business than the songs that got released.",

    "content": "I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner, but the closest parallel to the seismic shift of AI might be samples, even more so than things like digital recording or Pro Tools. When Hans Zimmer recorded an orchestra and started writing music with a DAW and showing clients mockups, nothing was ever the same. For a long time (even now!) the pencil-and-paper people griped about how it wasn't real composition. Orchestras feared that they would all be replaced by computers. But ultimately, everyone had to come to terms with the new world order and adapt. There was a period in the mid-90s through mid-late 2000s where orchestral writing was reduced to nothing more than long notes and short notes. All of the nuance was gone, because the tech couldn't handle it yet and people blamed the tech. Many mourned the loss of true orchestral writing, yearning for a by-gone era. \n\nBut eventually, people learned to harness these new tools and they met the technology on its own terms. People are doing wildly innovative things with samples now, we've moved completely past the era of \"can I make a convincing clarinet come out of my keyboard?\" Orchestras and live musicians have not been replaced. Sure, the process is different than it used to be, but that's how innovations work. All of us would be living very different lives without samples of drums, guitars, orchestras, synths, etc. There will be a generation coming up where AI is already a thing, they won't have ever lived in the before-times. Just like those here who've never cut to tape. It's okay.",

But I had my first 3-4 things that started getting attention get taken away from me by managers/ labels/ bigger producers/ bigger mixers. Once I got to that next level it was obvious why I wasn't the guy yet. But if you're working on things that are at some point getting out there in a real way, that's the place that most people are before they jump up. \n\nSome of it is opportunity, some of it is skillset, some of it is time management (if you're hustling, it helps to turn great shit around before everyone else), and some of it is just the intangibles that come from more reps. \n\nMy One Direction song came out 17 years after I first recorded the first band I was in. I'm not recommending anyone spend 17 years doing something all the time for no real money. But that's how it went for me.",

I can certainly tell you the principles and strategies for how you might get good. But you need to find your own way and do the work.

The job has been able to subsidize what has turned into a parallel career. I have designs on having this be my full time gig at some point, but I'm taking it slow, honing my craft and building my client base and studio while the steady paycheck is there. It's nice to be able to do that without grinding to make ends meet. I realize that is a privileged position to be in so I am grateful. With COVID, I can also crank out masters while I WFH when there's downtime or I need a work break.

Now laptops are so fast that you could just plug in that way. Trying to navigate software versions and licenses -- not to mention linking sample libraries --  on someone else's machine is a nightmare. Bringing your computer is always the easiest way. If you're in Pro Tools, do yourself a favor and export the studios I/O settings into a file before you power down and swap over. That's my hot take.",

Really interesting stuff, and @BatMeckley made me start thinking about it more with his comment about guitar gear. We as a collective grow and evolve over time and go through cycles but there are fundamentals that still remain true. We want to capture the emotion and represent something that will best suit the song. Different production and mixing styles help accomplish that but it\u2019s cool to see how things change over time.

(I had a similar automatic update situation.)\n\nPro Tools type-to-search plugins when adding an insert isn't working for me. Other than that it's working smoothly.\n\nAbleton a bit slower and glitchy but hard to pinpoint the cause. I've done a lot of plugin removal troubleshooting and I can't confidently figure out what's happening. I'm only using VST3 where possible. Some VST2 and no AU. I'm assuming the 12 update will solve these issues.\n\nAuto-tune PRO continues to be  a glitchy pile of shit. Auto-tune artist has all this latency when recalled, even if it's on \"classic\" mode (which is low latency). In order to remove the latency, when opening an existing session, I have to open auto-tune, change the setting off classic and then back on. Then the latency returns to zero.\n\nA few other plugins just recently updated and work (Reaktor, some of the Neural DSP stuff). But that was for silicon native I think, not Sonoma.",

    "content": "My main tip for using Live live is try and replace as many third party plugins as you possibly can with stock, freeze as much as you can, and most of the latency you experience is going to be coming from internal delay compensation vs I/O latency.  If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

Why did the artist have these types of revisions. And then figure that out and bother y\u2019all about signal chains so I can change shit up for the next one. And then just rinse and repeat.",

And thank you for your correcting my misunderstanding re the \u201c doubling \u201c part of my question . Ill review this also. \n\n@David Fuller thank you v much for taking the time to write and explain that . Particularly your explanation of tube and FET circuits . Really great thanks. I suppose in a sense, if we think of the signal flow from mic through analogue electrical circuits , back out to analogue at a listeners speaker......I\u2019m fascinated with how sonic information and its identifying qualities (such as harmonic content of an instrument , and its pitch....and say for a vocalist for example .....how does the character of a consonant .....or a vowel...how is this encoded into an electrical circuit to then again be recreated into an identifiable analogue reproduction upon return to the world of sound waves ? How do we manipulate these harmonics in a controlled way electrically And how did we discover this ? It\u2019s imho mind blowing ......\n\nto your point about the complexity of understanding distortion , I feel like maybe this is what I\u2019m going to need to understand \n\n I need to find the answer in physics as to how can a voice be transmitted as an electron flow, then re rendered as a human voice again .....its  fascinating to think a voltage / current can carry the information that is someone\u2019s voice and the emotion of a performance \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.

In parallel, it acts as a low pass filter.  An inductor does the opposite of a capacitor - high pass in parallel, low pass in series. These, along with resistors, are the basic \"building blocks\" of a passive filter network.",

I have spent so much time obsessing over my mix buss, to now just delete everything on there.  No more \"safety net\".  Time to step up.\nI have also been obsessed with the new Kimbra album.  The mixes are INSANE.  And then of course I finally look and see.....Castelli did it.  And now that I understand his current view on letting the dynamics breathe, I get why it has that sound.  At least a major factor as to why.\nWhen they described it as feeling \"dangerous\", I realized how I often use my Mix Buss to feel \"safe\".",

For instance, I love love love Jaime by Brittany Howard, and Shawn is phenomenal (AND if shit sounds great who cares what the LUFS meter says), but it is loud as hell. With streaming theoretically leveling the playing field a bit, what are you guys looking for when you get a record mastered? Is there someone mastering right now who is just boldly NOT slamming a limiter and letting things breathe more? Do we care?\n\nI ask partly because, like I think many people, I incorporate a limiter on my mix bus to get things loud and be mixing \u201cinto\u201d a mastering chain, and this has led me down a bit of a rabbit hole.",

I currently have a separate production/writing template and then another for mixing but I\u2019m trying to hybridise and streamline them a little more to get faster results and hopefully focus on the song. Also, most of the songs I mix tend to be one\u2019s I\u2019ve written and produced as well, so hoping to cut down on session set-up time.\n\nSome of mine are an instant \u201cduck bus\u201d, which I picked up from Ian Kirkpatrick. It\u2019s a pre-loaded aux with something like LFO Tool or shaper box on it, so you can quickly route and uniformly make things side chain.\n\nAnother quick workflow thing I love is having Pro Tools audio playlists with a bunch of reverse sweeps, impacts and other transition fx/ear candy hidden and ready to go in the session, so you can quickly try out a bunch. \n\nI also have the trim plugin added as the first and last plugin on every new track preset, as I use them to quickly manage the gain in and out of each track and so I don\u2019t have to search for them constantly.\n\nOzone Spectral shaper on some music busses and as a replacement for Soothe on the mix bus has also been a real win (thanks Jon!) Although these sorta things aren\u2019t turned on whilst writing as they have a ton of latency.\n\nKeen to hear what you all find useful!",

It's simply not very high on my list of priorities. I'd say I'm self-centered in how I approach making music. I'm out to make stuff that *I* want to hear. Things that aren't being represented elsewhere. Flavors I've never heard. I'm not aiming for a broad appeal, but I'm also not shying away from it. I'm just not much of a people pleaser in that regard. I'm in it for the discovery and the exploration and the pleasure of making something that excites me.\n\nI think often about that Steve Jobs sentiment of \"People don't know what they want until they see it.\" I think about that a lot. I trust that if I follow what feels good to *me* then I'll get something valuable out of it, and maybe it'll connect with others. If not, that's alright too. I'll know that I've made something that feels great.\n\nI sometimes worry about this because I've always felt that it puts me at odds with a lot of people out here trying to make excellent records. Sometimes our goals will align, but I just don't feel motivated by the need to appeal to a lot of people and that can also make us diverge.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a different kind of taste that I'm trying to cultivate. It's one that runs parallel to the kind of taste that is good at appealing to a large number of people. I feel as if I'm aiming at an entirely different goalpost from people playing the other game. I want to tickle people in a way that they didn't know they were capable of. That's what's thrilling to me.",

Just a quick one , I wanted to essentially thank you for sharing your appreciation of rx here as much as you have , making mention of your use of the spectral repair tool. I\u2019ve been paying attention and taking notice and reflecting on what it is I\u2019m trying to achieve with de Essers and Eq\u2019s on mix elements  etc and this morning I just wasn\u2019t getting the vibe I wanted from a vocal . It just wasn\u2019t natural anymore . It felt perfectly bland . Your rx comments came to mind and I removed pretty much all the corrective inserts , opened up rx and between the magic tool (I found this good for the high end ) and the paintbrush (on the low end /plosives ) I pretty much sculpted the natural sound of the vocal all in rx , without any distractions. Just.....the sound ....of the vocal. Having finished and returning to the mix , it was everything I\u2019d wanted with about a third of the plug in inserts. I\u2019m a major convert to this upstream, approach . In this case it was a vocal but I\u2019m intrigued to apply the principle on a master. The inspiration came from yourself. Thanks man .",

So, next steps will be to get three things working:\n1) NAM\n2) Proteus (cause maybe it sounds better)\n3) that OG plugin\n\nI\u2019d recommend doing some kind of routing, even potentially out through a patchbay if necessary, and then \u201clearning\u201d the plugin. It doesn\u2019t need to be on same computer though that would be simpler. \n\n@oaklandmatt were the settings on those plugins all different? Or did you kind of have a universal preset or three that you used?",

This is my plan, I talked with him a lot about how he uses each piece of gear and I was really intentional about setup. I would love some advice, and also, I', wondering if there's something I am missing about gain staging or signal flow - is it as simple as just plugging in all the I/O?",
