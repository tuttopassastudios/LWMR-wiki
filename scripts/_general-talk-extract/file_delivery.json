I crushed it on a deadline, then that same A&R hired me a year later to work on a band called Emblem 3 who was on X Factor US as well. I crushed that and then six months after that he recommended me to a UK A&R who was having trouble finishing a song for One Direction. I did a spec production on the song Best Song Ever and they liked it and used it and all of a sudden I become a big pop producer. Stemming from doing an great job on some instrumental cover for a dumb singing tv show.",

No matter how shitty my delivery or communication, they approach things with a smile and a sense of humor. I\u2019ve literally never heard either of them complain. I thought commiserating about shitty aspects of a gig was a part of professionalism, but they have me rethinking things. \n\nIn my own projects, when I approach clients with patience and curiosity, I find that not only are they happier faster, I\u2019m happier the whole time. It\u2019s SO MUCH EASIER to say \u201clet\u2019s try it\u201d than to say \u201chere\u2019s why that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d I find I learn a lot that way too. \n\nIn any case, going back in to fix or add only bugs me when I think I\u2019m supposed to be done. If I can stay open, then opening a session feels a lot easier. \n\nSo I guess my advice is: you might have fewer problem clients if you try to remember they\u2019re not problems to solve, they\u2019re people to serve.",

I hate to say it but that's clunky as hell and you may as well be using Google Drive at that point (No!). Using Dropbox in-browser to navigate should be a last resort.\n\nThe move here is to connect Dropbox with your desktop so that your Dropbox folder appears and functions like any other folder in your Finder window. It will be far far easier to manage your files this way because they now have all of the same navigation functionality as your local files. \n\nI understand your desire not to download everything from your DB to your local drive. That's an easy thing to control once you wrap your head around how selective sync works. Once you get DB set up on your desktop you can specify that nothing should be downloaded to your local drive unless you specify (online-only), but you will still be able to see all of the cloud files inside of your DB folder in the Finder.\n\nIf you decide you want to download a file to your local drive you can right-click on the file and tell it to download (make available offline). And if later you decide to remove it from your local drive and make it cloud-only you can select \"make online only\". It's pretty simple once you get up to speed on the workflow.",

    "content": "Coincidentally I was exploring a similar idea this morning. I'm on a David Bohm kick and was reading his book 'On Dialogue' and recently finished his 'On Creativity' (would highly recommend both).\n\nIn 'On Dialogue' he gives an example I think can be repurposed here. Imagine a song being presented to us. An external signal. When it reaches us it makes contact with what Bohm calls the \"whole movement of thought\". The thinking and feeling apparatus within us is activated. Thoughts and 'felts' are said to be fundamentally created from memory. Upon contact a 're-presentation' is created where the activity of our thought and feeling reforms the event internally. The 'net presentation' is the fused result. 'Mis-representation' occurs when we mistake the 'net presentation' for the original.\n\nI was thinking on all this and how it might connect to your comment from yesterday, \"I told Jon that I don't think he's ever brought more to an album, but also left less of his fingerprints on it\".\n\nBohm brings up Michael Polanyi's idea of tacit knowledge. This is the always running in the background implicit structure we attend to music from, which makes 're-presentation' possible. This includes nostalgia for records we love, perceptual training, bodily memory, tolerance for brightness, etc... Implied here is that this is something you cannot turn off but can cultivate greater awareness off in disciplined participation with art. Polanyi says we attend from subsidiaries to a focal whole. If you start attending to your own sonic fingerprint as the focal object, the structure may collapse. So perhaps Jon was able to integrate a remarkable tacit contribution while being sensitive to the pre-existing structure and coherence of the whole. Maybe coherence and truth have similar meanings here?\n\nDownstream of the artist's origination maybe 'truth' in record making is deep tacit integration, suspending egoic domination, and sensitivity to the internal structure / coherence of the original whole.",

This role is changing, and we'd all be smart to understand where it's headed.\n\nI get hired to finish songs a lot. Usually that means I have a \"co-producer\" credit. Sometimes it means \"mixer\" credit. Occasionally it's included \"mastering.\" But really what I'm hired for is that combination of experience and technical knowledge. I'm an outside ear who knows how to fix what's missing. This role of \"finisher\" is really where a lot of the producer/ mixer/ mastering engineer profession is headed. The distinction between those roles is getting blurrier. \n\nMixing engineers have moved from pulling up faders on the console and creating a mix (old school \"mixers\") to often just pulling up the rough mix of stems and making finishing touches (Jon, Manny, Serban, Tony, Bainz, etc.).\n\nIn this way, the \"mixing engineer\" profession is moving away from manipulating raw sounds to manipulating nearly finished mixes. This is sounding more and more like what a \"mastering engineer\" does. Now there's \"stem mixing\" and \"stem mastering\" too, further blurring the lines. These are all just slightly different configurations of the same thing. Who do you hire to get perspective and then act on it?\n\nThose of us that are finishers or mixers or mastering engineers or whatever would be smart to think about how to adapt to the direction this is all headed. \n\nI want us all to win. I think we need to step back and expand how we think about the roles. It's the best way for us all to have careers.",

If you slap soothe on a vocal it will start indiscriminately nuking resonances whether you like them or not, whether they\u2019re useful or not. An experienced engineer will spot a problem frequency, eq it out, or sometimes multiband it. But ANYONE can slap soothe on without much knowledge of where the problem is, and have it \u201cfix\u201d it, while at the same time neutering everything else. (Also, setting up mixes where everything is the same \u201cflat\u201d leading to these awful mixes that sound like a 2 trk and a vocal stem, rather than a cohesive record.",

If only we had pure meritocracy here. Sam Fender put it really well this week with regards to the music industry so I won\u2019t go over stony ground, you can google his thoughts which I largely relate to.\n\nAs an individual I\u2019m horribly determined and annoyingly persistent when I have a goal in mind, as well as always balancing that with being the kindest person I can be towards others (sometimes to my detriment) and pretty much always in a headspace of bettering myself personally and professionally. This has generally been the key to many of the opportunities I\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s an English word for it, \u201cnous\u201d, which I think is similar to agency but also encompasses the notion of having \u201cgood sense\u201d.

    "content": "So I climbed into my 2010 Volvo S80 today. And for the first time in 2025. I was going to listen to my music on the speakers. I plugged in my usb c adapter. Into the coaxial cable that runs into the center console, for that true old analog gold plated warmth. Turned the windows and volume all the way up, then as I prepared to hit play. I was blanketed with the all to familar tension. That very same feeling from when I was going to have to sit next to one of the two dudes on the middle school basketball team. Who took as their daily task, to pay homage to ancestral animal social structures, by drowning any nearby male counter part with sack taps, donkey punches, and nail whip flicks. You just preemptively flinch at the inevitable pain from their onslaught. I hit play on a mix that is -5.8 lufs at peak. No proverbial donkey punch to my thighs this time. The song didn't overload the speakers at any point. As I heard the mix in my studio. I heard it here. The things I loved about it. I loved it here. The things I was unsure about. I was equally unsure about them here. My eyes welled up a bit with fulfillment and gratitude. It took me longer and cost more than I could of ever imagined, when I started this journey. But I got here. No longer do I have to worry about translation of the mix. I can focus all my worry on the feeling and vibe of the performace. I'm willing to let my ego have this one, this mix punches with any modern mix on earth. On any system. (Sounds killer on the Meta Ray Bans. And those speakers are rutheless honest. Ive heard alot of overloaded low end mixes on em) And back to the gratitude. I wanted to thank this place. I couldn't have done it without yall. I'd still be in a pitch black room looking for a switch that felt like it was hidden on the ceiling. Now back to work! Have a great day yall!!",

    "content": "On this note, I'll say that I LOVE these drives. My workflow in the past has basically been to buy a new 1GB SSD drive every few projects. When I had my setup on a laptop, this allowed me to always have access to projects I was working on the go (printing stems on the couch while watching TV? Yes please). In addition to using these SSDs, I'd always keep local backups with 'Sync Folders Pro' -- RIP Sync X -- on a cheaper, larger capacity USB drive. Being an anxious data archiver, I also signed up for Backblaze a few years ago as a cloud solution in case my studio burns down. Its a really great service, but the caveat they have with your drives is you *can* back up externals, they just need to be connected to your computer every 30 days. So I bought this monster USB3 hub and just had all of these fucking SSDs connected to my computer whenever it was setup at my studio. It worked fine for a few years, but I ran out of space again a few weeks ago and decided to futureproof mysetup a little bit. I ended up getting a thunderbolt Drobo. That way, I could have redundant storage for archived projects (which also gets uploaded to backblaze) but without having 16 drives on my desktop. Now I just have two of those samsung SSDs -- one work, and one as a backup. They run lightning fast and I get to keep having local backups in case I fuck the dog moving files around after a few glasses of wine. Then, when I run out of space, I just offload onto the Drobo and it's locally redundant, and also backed up on the cloud. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",

    "content": "I think a good way to summarize the benefit of Andrej's approach here is by looking at two different ways to go about learning how a frog works: \n\n1) You can dissect a frog to learn about it. You observe the long legs, the muscles, the skin, the eyes, the respiratory system, etc. You see it's strengths and you see it's weaknesses and you draw your conclusions from there. This would be the top-down learning approach. It's good at describing what already *is*. \n\nOr...\n\n2) You build/design a frog from scratch. You will quickly come to understand why things *have* to be the way they are. You realize that all of the evolutionary \"choices\" about a frog's physiology are simply the best possible compromises, given the pressures of the environment, the availability of resources, and the limits of physics. By building it yourself you will come to perceive all of the invisible challenges and \"solved\" problems that were required to make an organism that will simply survive, much less thrive.\n\nThis firsthand experience of building the thing will actually make you an expert because you've done the hard work and experienced it for yourself. You took ten paths to failure and made every mistake before settling on a a non-obvious compromise that allows you to balance it against every other factor. You understand *why* it needs to be that way.\n\nThis knowledge will make you robust and flexible, whereas top-down knowledge is more superficial and brittle. If the conditions of your subject change and the model you understand is no longer relevant then you're in a far more precarious place than someone who's built something from the ground up.",

    "content": "I have to let you know my first experience with this. Been working on an album that I recorded one year ago. Recording took us 7 days and they still needed to add synths and bass fot some of the songs after that (side note: the production wasn't finished by the time we tracked, so I edited everything I had - 10 songs, none of them with less than 5 minutes. It was the band's first time in the studio, also, and had to edit lots of drums and bass stuff). After doing a first pass, I sent them the multitracks they asked for, to track the rest of their stuff with their producer (a colleague of mine). The next 8 months were spent waiting on their files to start mixing (this was supposed to last 1/2 months, max). When I finally got the files, you have no ideia how messy the project turned out (track names, bounce mistakes, ultrapocessed tracks with artifacts - even the ones we've tracked at the studio before, audible edit points,... all you can imagine going wrong at this point), so it took me a bunch of time to organize everything in a way that I could work with what I've got (going back and forth asking the producer for some files that didn't even get to me or asking if there was the possibility to get some of the tracks dry, without processing or fx - keep this in mind).\n\nNeedless to say, when I was ready to start mixing, I was already overwhelmed and tired of it, and I knew I still had a long way to go...\n\nFirst version took me probably too long to get right (2 months, approx., working on other projects that got scheduled on those 8 months) and I've sent it before I went on a few days vacation.",

Just to add one more angle to the mix: most of you have been referring to agency as some kind of positive trait that you either have or you don\u2019t have it \u2014 almost commodifying it. What if we think of agency, or the qualities of having agency no matter what term we use, as the norm? As in EVERYONE has it. And whether or not we are able to fulfill those qualities and/or desires is due to limiting factors, whether they are external forces (class system, institutional racism, gender discrimination, war, peer pressure, financial hardship, lack of resources, etc) or internal struggles (fear, self-doubt, depression, addiction, laziness, inner saboteur, etc) or any combination thereof. I know it\u2019s totally idealistic but maybe if we\u2019re able to think of everyone as being just as capable as the next -- instead of an \u201ceither-you-got-it-or-you-don\u2019t\u201d kind of way, especially in terms of \u201cagency\u201d which sounds like a corporate buzzword du jour -- then we\u2019d be able to focus on and address the aspects of our societal constructs and daily lives that restrict our opportunities to succeed/work/create/thrive/survive/exist.",

    "content": "As a former (what I would call pretty high level) athlete, I actually think about this thing very intently with regards to working on records and draw from things from the past life. Mine is more focused on how I want to hear (or rather deeply understand how I'm hearing) every day as close to consistent as possible, given we are human of course.\n\nMy 2 cents (which of course is just my experience): \n\nSome sort of routine before you work. Mine is that I wake up almost exactly at the same time every day, will work out at similar times (if possible), literally eat the same thing basically every day before during the work day, coffee at similar times, have  the same routine when I sit down to start work. Not all of that is possible or useful for everyone, but I think we can all find something that would focus us in a way that's useful and ablet to be put into practice for us.\n\nTruly I find it helps a lot. We are physical beings, how our systems and bodies interact can definitely matter, especially in our ability to be available to the music.\n\nThat said, sometimes things happen and you gotta go. You will be tired, stressed, whatever. You have to do excellent work under those conditions too, it might be the most important skill if we are being honest about making a career of this. So training specifically for when you feel rough is definitely something I personally find important.  Which is where physically training helps, it's a way to force yourself into (fake) adversity and train response\n\n@Slow Hand I know you know all this, just my experience",

    "content": "Nail on the head. I think I had mentioned this in a previous post, but these days notes tend to come in real time -- via text messages, dropbox comments, or sometimes even thoughtful emails. I'll usually take a quick glance, but then dump everything into a note file so I have everything in one place when I sit to do the revision. This can be useful when you'll get a thread of notes like 1) I'm not sure about the drum sound, it feel so x... then 2) someone else will chime in saying I love the drums! I think x is the problem then 3) first person is hesitant and shrugs of their not, even though it may still bother them. That way I can try and string together some sort of move that will hopefully make everyone happy. If you're dealing with a band -- and you're producing/engineering -- you'll have had the benefit of seeing the dynamic. Sometimes you get some people that are more engaged and tweaky, others that are unsure of EVERYTHING, and then people that when they say something, they're usually right, as infrequent as that may be. This is very useful during mix notes time because you have context. If you're just getting flies flown to you and you've never met the band/artist, thats certainly a bit more of a challenge and will likely require more work on your end to smooth things out.",

Many people working in audio have never even seen such a machine. They are complicated - there are techs who work on consoles who won\u2019t touch cutting lathes. IMO the best lathes were made by Neumann in the 70s/early 80s, and that was a long time ago. You have a TON of electronics and mechanics that need to be refurbished / restored to get the lathe to make some great cuts. Some engineers are cutting on some nicely restored systems and some are using some OLD stuff which should have been pulled for maintenance decades ago. Imagine if 50% of the records today were mastered on 50 year old loudspeakers with blown drivers and mismatched crossovers. We might notice.",

There was a very \u201calive\u201d life to the hardware that really transformed the keys part -~~ the soundtoys sounded comparatively like a blurry stereo gauze around the sound (but can be cool as its own thing).~~ [*That was my memory this morning of what it sounded like in 2019 - see edit below though, I now disagree with my memory*] \n\nThe closest I got to the \u201cspirit\u201d of the hardware was the microshift section of the Ultrachannel strip. It\u2019s definitely not for everything, but on that occasion it made the most sense.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s interested I can share some of the channels (wurli, gtrs, and BVs) and the hardware H3000 returns I printed so you can see for yourself what gets you there.\n\n\n[*Out of interest I reopened the session just now and tried out Soundtoys Microshift again - it's not bad at all. I'd even say that somehow sonically it's closer to the hardware than Ultrachannel, but still I think Ultrachannel gets closer to the spirit/vibe/neurophysiological impact of the hardware H3000 patch.*\n\n*Here's the patch I made in Ultrachannel - if anyone wants the session with parts to compare, DM me: https://strongroomstudios-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ross_strongroom_com/EvlK_gdag9dFhrmOQasFPt0BCPTv0qnr3Hiu3dwoLx5DrQ?e=A2m9u7*]",

Totally understand the hesitation to delegate - especially that first 6 months-a year where you're acutely aware that helping someone else do it is *more work* than just rolling up your sleeves and doing it yourself. \n\nFor building systems, what's worked for me is hiring and training your 'double(s)' first - someone with a similar skillset and sensibilities, very broad skills like me (who also did everything myself for a long time). This comes a lot easier if you have close friends in the same lane looking for jobs, I've seen people have their \"double(s)\" move in with them for a limited time too, with the intention of them soaking in exactly all you do.\n\nOnce my double(s) started doing pretty well, we started hiring more specialized people, and the doubles could then oversee their work, feedback etc - early on I would always be part of this, then slowly phase myself out.\n\nWhat I wish I would have done earlier would have been to hire a producer/overseer/manager/'my boss' - someone with a bit more skin in the game/responsibility, and who keeps you in line if you start wavering. \n\nAgain, I didn't love the setup of 10 and dissolved it eventually - as a creative it's easy to feel like you built a house/efficiency machine and one day you wake up and it's a prison that's not as flexible as you want. That's another thing I'm trying to keep in mind (I'm putting together a new similar team for this fall) - how do you keep the team agile and ready to shift when priorities shift? It could be as easy as accepting a little bit more churn & letting people go when they don't fit what's going on, but it's hard to let go of people you've trained and know well. I felt a friendship connection with my entire team, in hindsight I think that was a mistake too.\n\nThose are some thoughts haha - what have you found so far? Are you experiences lining up with mine? What kind of roles are you hiring for?",

We're perceiving the tire after it's already done almost a full revolution and we see it in the position *behind* where it once was. Hence the perception of spinning backwards. It's the same thing with audio. If the sample rate isn't fast enough it reads the super-high frequencies as being lower than they actually are.",

I move slowly and make sure I understand before I move on. It may take two months to complete, but I'm steady with it and I do a little bit most days. It's common for me to transcribe notes from high-density talks that I want to learn from and revisit them often over the span of a week. I'm constantly printing out my notes and reading material so that they're easy to revisit throughout the week.\n\nI'm currently taking a project management course through MIT, which has been great. It's uncommon for me to do formal schooling these days, but this is work related and a direct application to my future capabilities that we thought would be beneficial for the company.\n\nWhen I buy a new plugin (rare) I set aside time to go through it and turn every knob and try each feature to see what it's capable of. Learning a tool on the spot is a good way to kill the creative flow, so I do the exploration up-front when possible.\n\nOften I'll have ideas for novel ways to use a tool (layering distortion, for example) and I'll set aside two hours to explore it and see what I find.\n\nThat said, I think my day-to-day may be quite different from a lot of folks here. My eggs aren't all in the business and pressures of record production, and so I rarely find myself buried in such commitments. I tend to keep \"normal\" business hours these days and keep a hard separation between my commitments and my leisure.\n\nIn fact I'd say that I'm actively structuring my life so that I can retain my leisure and don't find myself overwhelmed with commitments. That's a whole other story, though.",

If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

I think unlimited music is certainly worth that. Setting aside, for the moment, all of the other complexities around market pricing, we also need to remember that Spotify's largest streaming competitors are Apple and Amazon.\n\nThese are companies with massive war-chests derived from the success of their non-streaming companies. Even if Spotify *wanted* to raise the cost of their service, companies like Apple and Amazon can afford to keep the price of streaming services depressed and sustain a loss on their streaming services for far longer than Spotify ever could. To my eyes, Spotify doesn't have a whole lot of wiggle-room to adjust their pricing and therefore their payout models.\n\nI say as much, because in casual discussions around streaming payouts, there doesn't seem to be much awareness of the larger business ecosystem that a company like Spotify finds itself in.",

    "content": "a number of years ago I consulted on a music tech curriculum for grades 10-12, these were some of the key points:\n\n- Teach the fundamentals, always in a practical way. E.g. \"Today we're going to record ourselves speaking\" - briefly introduce how a microphone works, what a preamp is, and then get them recording each other. Same with EQ, Compressor, Reverb, Delay, etc.\n\n- Use as many examples from current pop music as possible. Does someone in the class sing or rap? Have the students go through assembling a vocal chain with a compressor, EQ, etc. and record part of a song.\n\n- Don't get too far in the weeds where it's not necessary. High schoolers DO need to know why we have different sample rates and bit depths. They DON'T need to know about aliasing, oversampling, clocking, or dither algorithms.\n\n- Bring history in for context, but don't dwell on it. It's cool to know that we used to need a speaker in an echoey room or a giant metal plate to make a reverb, but focus on how and why they're using effects rather than where they came from",

When doing it this way MD  stand-alone has the edge over the plug-in because it\u2019s all right there in front of me. It\u2019s easy to visually reference a quad tracked lead vocal, and then align and de ess or consonant 8 harmonies. That\u2019s where the stand-alone really shines, is massively dense stacks vocals like that, and not having to keep opening up a plug-in to change a different part or vibrato or formant of a particular track  of the stack or what not. Especially once you get the groove locked in on the lead, it\u2019s just so easy to make all other 30 tracks lock in with it. \n\nFor a solo vocal soul song? I\u2019m probably just audio suiting AT in graph mode in PT. It ultimately sounds the best.",

The platforms opening up to everybody is why someone like myself or my clients can upload any kind of music. \n\nI mention all of this to say\u2026 I think that\u2019s what they wanted.

In some cases, even the intended audience. with that said, if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. \n\n/ might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it. \n\nso who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. \n\nthis is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world. but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

Given that operating systems and DAW updates are always going to provide a moving target, it doesn't seem unreasonable to have some sort of upgrade fee or plan for them to cover their costs in the development of updated software. I just think with Waves, their whole pricing model is on drugs and it's hard to attain any semblance of sanity from their upgrade plans.",

That along with finger strength & dexterity would often result in stumbles or slips, which also vary based on how you strike the key. Most common error you\u2019ll see that slows down technique is wrists dipping below the fingers a la traditional keyboard typing at any point in the playing process, and you\u2019re never gonna swing an arpeggio or move fast enough to trill because your physical relation to the keys is what dictates proficiency. The physical aspect is why pianists are brought in so young (I started at supervised playing at 4 and I started instruction when I could get through the alphabet), because you can shape them into technique machines. \n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for max utility, finger drills, wrist position, and scales as much as possible is going to keep you sharp as hell.",

    "content": "I feel like budgeting expenses to see what you\u2019re actually looking at and what you actually need down to the last dollar and cent (as crazy as it sounds, it can be done fairly accurately, and some banks/creditors even provider a CVS file for excel usage of spending logs) and figuring out how to get to your breakeven point every single month eliminates a lot of angst, and often times it\u2019s not as crazy as you think. I\u2019m not quite in LA, my move there is next month end of September, but CoL in San Diego is nearly identical to LA in most ways. Once I put my shit into an excel spreadsheet and did the math on \u201cthis is break even; this is what it looks like if I go out every once and a while; this is what it looks like if I\u2019m off my rocker with my credit card\u201d I could put rather definitive numbers on things and it gave me peace of mind.\n\nAs for more of the how: I think gaming the roommate system is your best bet. I\u2019m moving into a two bedroom place with my roommate/collaborator as well as my long time girlfriend. If you can find a way to split a bedroom, that\u2019s gonna help. 2 bed room houses for rent aren\u2019t that bad if you\u2019re willing to sit down with a drink or two on Zillow for a few nights and really figure out your living area. I\u2019ve found places for the $2300 in East LA and Pasadena. Splitting that and other key living expenses (we plan to have a few nights where we eat together and we\u2019ll sorta rotate meal ideas, that way everyone\u2019s not shelling out super ridiculous individual grocery charges) among 3 people each month is fairly easy so long as we hustle well.",

I bother him with layman mathematical questions all the time and he humours me. he's a good guy. Ive attempted to read some of his reference books from his studies and they are just baffling.....and like a mesmerising alien language. I have a friend who is studying astrophysics doing her phd and she saw me reading the book ive just linked.I was discussing with her how ive always found it odd that in maths 1 multiplied by nothing becomes nothing (as opposed to remaining one). I used to argue with my maths teacher about this for the longest time. I was saying that im suspicious of our concept of 0 in maths and see it as somewhat of a cheat number....and the romans actually didn't have a numeral for 0 (as though this somehow gives weight to my theory ). She trumped me with all my little maths problems and started talking to me about imperfect numbers in maths and how she believes that these reveal that we are fundamentally misunderstanding something foundational about our own existence and that one day she hopes someone will discover a new numerical system that can resolve these numbers . I love a good science/metaphysical debate....sub atomic science, art, buddhism , taoism , maths they all start to speak the same (wave based language ).",

You then take that, apply it to your schedule, readjust your plan if needed (ie to accommodate clients with deadlines or other constraints) and let everyone know the plan.

Everything that concerns \u201cme\u201d starts with working on myself. \n\nBut my belief as someone who makes art; it is my job to be concerned about it, and spend time pondering on it. I\u2019m not responsible or I can\u2019t be for it, it would be an arrogance and narcissism (or ego centric frame of mind at the very least) to believe that I\u2019m responsible for it or matters in any way - but I think believing that what I do would have no impact on others is inconsiderate. \n\nI believe it would help people find things they like if everyone alivned their taste/values to their individuality; rather than the idea of their individuality.\n\nRe: Korea; \nyou bring up a very good point about this. Korea is an extreme case of collectivism over individualism, and my obsession about this probably stems from growing up in that background. I only truly understand two cultures from first hand experience and that is Korean and North American; but it seems that no matter how culture forms, human nature will always be relevant and it\u2019s in our nature to be want to be accepted, feel included. \n\nI believe that American individualist propaganda is a lie. It\u2019s not about being yourself, it\u2019s rather about finding a box to put yourself in for sake of convenience. i believe it mostly has to do with consumerism and the complexity of the society from immigration and various cultures coming together; converging / diverging at different pace even amongst those that share the same cultural roots- which then later becomes nu-gen X-American culture, which is different from the culture of X. (X being a country/ethnic group)",

Like we came out of mono and into stereo and Jesus gains were made .!..for all the new clever software have we made those sorts of gains from it ? I think loudness techniques yes defo , but otherwise ? Hmmm . I feel like the best records today are being made by people who really know their engineering ish\u2026..like LWMR was kinda all about imho . \n\nSo it feels like a lot of the promo on \u201canalogue emulations / stem splitters / multi band resonance tools \u201c \u2026..although very clever \u2026.kind of miss the point when it comes to becoming good at this mindfuck of mixing",

To piggyback off what @peterlabberton said, when I mix, I rarely need to be a tiebreaker. Most of those situations get decided by delivering a mix update with two options. Just do the teeny bit of extra work and give them options, and they'll usually decide amongst themselves.",

There's a lot of people out there with similar unconventional principles to him (like putting load thru knees over toes and back flexion etc) but are definitely much more educated on the topics they're speaking on, and won't block you when you confront them..\n\nId personally reccomend the likes of Jeffery Wolfe (@theflexibull), moses Bernard (@mosesbernard), Dan van zandt (@flexibility.research), Nicholas Simpson (@nicholassimpson_)\n\nI've reached out to them before and they're always very helpful, nice people, I know they often do live videos themselves, maybe it could be worth asking one of them to do a podcast with you..\nI definitely don't consider myself an expert on this stuff, but I feel I have a very good base knowledge on health and fitness, I've been heavily involved in track and feild most my life, competed internationally too, so keeping strong, flexible and pain free is definitely something I've experience in lol",

    "content": "In a space that small, as much absorption as you can have will help you. Do you have a bigger room to record in or do you need the isolation? You'll likely get better sonic results if you can find a room with some more volume... that will also allow you to play with position in front of the microphone. As far as the level you should record at, if you've got any half-decent mic pre than you can go into the computer pretty conservatively. Assuming you don't have a super noisy chain, there'll be plenty of headroom in a 24 bit recording to bring it up after the fact. If you're looking for numbers, I'd shoot to get things into your DAW at around -18 dBFS. Many of the plugins modeled after analog gear tend to be happier with that level (or less if you're unsure).",

    "content": "Anyway: uncompressed PCM audio (.wav and .aiff) is made up of digital words generally 16 or 24 bits long recorded however many times a second for a given sample rate, for fixed point (integer) values. Each bit represents ~6dB of dynamic range. Every time you go up in level 6dB from that particular sample point, another bit flips from 0 (off) to 1 (on). The least significant bit defines your noise floor, so 16 bit audio has 96dB of dynamic range at maximum from noise floor to full scale (every bit turned on). Seems simple enough, right? And it isn't super complicated. But it has one problem: you run out of dynamic range real quick if you're changing levels with (virtual) faders at 24 bits. There are two ways around that:\n1, make the mixer engine run on a much higher integer word length (like old Pro Tools HD systems, which use 48 bit integer), and the mixer automatically converts the audio (if anything is done to it, including fader moves) to 48 bit. Think of this as adding more digits to the fractions side of a decimal point. \n2, make the mixer engine run on a floating point system (almost every other DAW, including more modern versions of Pro Tools) - that is, you move *where the decimal point is* . 32 bit float effectively works as 24 bits that can be moved around more or less with impunity, up or down.",

It still seems in development, but the one thing that really bothered me about the interface was the inability to link mix versions under some sort of tree system. So you could quickly switch between V1 or V5 and have everything organized that way. I found the clients still referencing older versions when we had already moved beyond. The note system was really useful though if the client is into that level of detail (this particular one was, so it was a benefit).",

Im still generally sending out 320 MP3s for the ref mixes, but i know some people have moved over to sending wavs since file size generally isnt an issue anymore. I still send via dropbox, and if it does get streamed thru the web interface, it seems if its encoding from a wav it sounds worse to me than if i was sending an mp3? Anyone else notice a diff? I find if .wav files get sent and the client streams thru web browser, half the time they will have a note about a click or pop at a certain point that isnt actually there.",

    "content": "I agree with matt that hiring a mastering engineer is a luxury in the present day tbh. Most of the records that I get to mix or produce I'm expected to deliver a finished product ready to release. However when a lot of things are at stake (label release) it's almost 100% sure that a mastering engineer will take care to finish the record, do some QC and especially keep a human touch to the art. Would a co-mixer be able to do that? possibly, depending on their skillset/experience.\n\nwith the use of AI and other systems the expense of hiring a mastering engineer is already fading away but only for projects that are less risky. Say, if you have a tape library of 500 symphonic recordings and need to submit it for streaming so a few folks can listen to it, labels will most likely get an automated system for that to make sure that the standard levels are ok and that it translates well. I'm sure there would be a hungry mastering engineer willing to get that done but the industry is past that era",

I guess it's sort of the noncommital side of me not wanting to abandon my custom PC at home which I know very well and has a clear upgrade path for the future (easily swap in a newer CPU/more memory ETC) whereas I need something that I can take with me on the road.  I think as I learn the limitations of the Macbook I got with the type of processing I normally do I might be able to commit fully to docking the laptop at home.  But yeah long story short it probably comes down to just not wanting to totally abandon the system I had going and try and find some sort of middle ground.",

First things first can you change it out to a solid core door and add weather stripping and some beefed up stops all the way around? You can get special door seal kits with a droppable bottom seal that seals tight to the floor when the door shuts, although these are like 200 bucks a pop and you can get similar if not better results making something yourself. You want to start by figuring out a rough mass per square foot for your wall assembly (include drywall, stud work, insulation etc) and then bring your door up to the same mass per square foot. Solid core door, good seals all the way around and then you can even add more mass to the door with drywall or plywood. Once your door is at least the same mass per square foot as your wall assembly you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere to gain more isolation",

I\u2019ve been able to download/upgrade/fix most of the heavy movers but some can\u2019t be installed on the current OS. Main culprits are the original Neutron and Vocalsynth (which I was using a lot at the time).\n\nI figure that in this situation I\u2019m going to have to recreate some sounds (which is fine as I\u2019ll be reproducing some of the more dated elements anyway) but it got me thinking about future proofing sessions going forward. It\u2019s made me even consider not using certain plugins in my productions if it\u2019s likely they won\u2019t be supported in the future (*cough* izotope).\n\nI\u2019m sure the solution is as simple as \u2018print a multitrack when done\u2019 but if anyone has any other thoughts I\u2019m all ears!",

Saying \"boddle of wadder\" allows your tongue to flow through the sentence quicker than if you reset your tongue to articulate all the hard t's in the same sentence. It feels more stilted that way.\n\nTo me it's like writing in cursive versus writing in print. Cursive lettering flows easier at the expense of clarity, but the clearer articulation of print writing is slower.",

    "content": "I guess it depends heavily on scale. $40 a month just to keep the doors open sounds steep for an artist who isn't already selling merch at a consistent rate. I haven't looked at Shopify's print on demand pricing, but in general POD is much higher cost than bulk screen printing t-shirts (for example). So if you're a band selling at the scale where $40/mo. on a slow month isn't your *entire* profit margin, it seems like investing in a run of merch would pay for itself.\n\nNow this is completely different if you look at it from the perspective of a clothing brand, where the goal is to have a diversity of designs available at all times, without the need for warehousing and a huge startup cost, and to consistently push sales to a customer base that's devoted to *the merch*. I can't imagine the vast majority of DistroKid artists are going that hard on ecommerce, but they could sure benefit from having their POD merch visible on their Spotify profile. The small artists I work with would probably be better off putting $40 into Instagram ads every month.",

Ive got a lil collection going of stems from released songs that would probably be helpful to put the lead vocal through melodyne and really listen and see whats going on.

I still keep all files on the old external drive in case I found anything has been damaged or broken during the move to LaCie.\n\nThe plan is to set up LaCie with Dropbox. I wiped my dropbox (that used to be a clone of the old drive) completely from the browser in order to set it up with LaCie.\n\nNow, setting it up with LaCie it says that the file format (Exfat) isn't compatible and I need to change the format of the drive to HFS+ or APFS. I know that while changing the format the drive will be completely wiped. So before doing this I need to transfer all the files again to another location. I have two external drives, a macbook and an iMac. None of them have enough storage to store my 2.5tb folder.\n\nAnyone have any idea of a good option other than to get ANOTHER external drive just to perform the move?\n\nIs my best option to make a back up of the old drive to Dropbox backup, then wipe the drive, move all files from Lacie back to it, reformat Lacie, move all files back to Lacie, wipe the old drive and download the backup from dropboc back to it?",

The caveat is that singles are released once a month for streaming (full thing on streaming platforms at the end of the year, so the example had 12 singles).  After seeing some good discussion about the idea, I'm curious as to what y'all think about it? \n\nThe main points I've heard in favor of the move:\n- 1 person buying the album for 10 bucks cancels out so many no's\n- Prioritizes real fans over casual listeners\n- Incentivizes an artist to make the album, because it's batching content for a year. \n- Forces the artist to view music as a business, but doesn't fully leave the Spotify ecosystem.",

Of course if there is something that is very noticeable that can't be resolved convincingly, I will absolutely flag it. Truly, I want the art to be the best it can and almost every single person I've worked with agrees.\n\nBUT -- why wouldn't you just want me to remove a click, attenuate an s, etc? Even did one today where I was removing some high end on just a few clap hits, easy in RX.  Attenuating down the volume of a breath, whatever. Easy. Almost always the result is indistinguishable from you removing it on your end. Then you don't have to reprint, etc etc, the artist gets it faster, everyone wins.\n\nThen there is also the issue of where the click or artifact is actually coming from. Lead vocal? Backgrounds? One of 15 of the background stacks? So much easier for me to just zap the issue on my end from the stereo file. Again, with all this being that the result is equal (and oftentimes better I'd argue)\n\nObviously if the edit is in the way of connection to the song or it genuinely would sound better as an edit in the mix, we do that. But even something like bridging a bad edit that has a space in an s, etc can be done well with spectral repair replace!",

As is the the operating system that reads that medium. As does the playback software that no longer plays back the medium. Etc etc etc. none of these things upgrade in tandem and it\u2019s a bit of a ballache to keep up. We are obviously trying to get to some universal standard but to truly do so would also mean impeding nothing that makes computers great, the constant evolution. \n\nI do believe tape is a great fantastic option for archival purposes, as is keeping several copies of said thing as Ruairi pointed out. But in the end (like, the _end_ end) a tape will probably serve as the best thing of which to retrieve music off of. If a tape machine isn\u2019t around, one can be _made_ from schematics and parts. Not sure that can be said for building a Mac and Mac OS from scratch\n\nSteve lived through an era where several proprietary digital mediums came and went and the problems that caused for something he deeply cared about\n\nI\u2019ve seen the same in the camera world, where camera bodies from 50-100 years ago are operable or at the very least repairable, while digital 80s and 90s camera bodies serve as paper weights\n\nI think we might see something similar with computers controlled vehicles with proprietary software. But I digress \n\nObviously I use digital, if I had the choice, I wouldn\u2019t. But it sure as hell makes a lot of music happen when it otherwise wouldn\u2019t. I just hope it sticks around",

I\u2019m with you . \n\nI think what I\u2019m wondering about is \u2026..with our modern lifestyles I totally get how the consumer is listening mostly by headphones now . And we as music makers are freed up enormously by working in headphones . I think rod waves album got a Grammy and was mixed on headphones iirc, perhaps it was a number 1 . Anyhoo , so I\u2019m not contesting the movement to headphone mixing , I\u2019m wondering for those who intend to or are doing all their work on headphones \u2026..how will you know how it feels in air ? As one day , the artist will perform it live . I come from club and sound system culture , so the ultimate destination is a wall of speaker boxes \u2026..and in the end music has to be re inforced for public performance . How do we know we ve got that balance right if we don\u2019t use speakers ? (Honest question )",

    "content": "With credits, is there a general consensus or definition on the distinction between  \"producer\" and \"additional production\" or is it always a case by case thing? Had a song I worked on (finished the production and did the mix) come out today. At the beginning of the project I had asked to be listed as a producer and mixer but realized when it came out, that the artist had listed himself as the producer and me as additional production/instrumentation, and mixer. The artist is a really good and longtime friend and I am going to just talk to him and ask that he fixes the credits (and will start making written agreements before all of my projects) but I am curious if there is any broader context that could help how I approach the conversation? \n\nNot super critical to the main question but here are some specifics of my situation: Artist wrote the song, and recorded some basic tracks (drums, vox, guitar). We then worked on it in my studio and I played more instruments (bass, guitars, keys, lap, steel, percussion). We then finished it remotely a few months later. Sent the Ableton production session back and forth a few times times and then I prepped and exported the files myself and mixed it in Protools. And I had to do what I would consider a fair amount of heavy lifting in the mix: song was pretty complicated and recorded at home so I ended up do doing a lot of clean up, some tuning, and a lot of sound shaping and effects. All that to say, this case feels pretty cut and dried but I am curious to know what types of work would appropriately fall under \u201cadditional production\u201d and what is standard in the industry. Thanks!",

    "content": "I was recently inspired after going to the cinema to see *A Complete Unkown*, the movie memoir about Bob Dylan; partially by Bob's story, but also by Timothy Chalomee's performance as Bob. All of the shots of him performing in the movie were fully live - which is an impressive feat by itself - but even more impressive that he apparently wasn't much of a musician before making the movie. I didnt know much about Timothy before this, so I watched his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's YouTube channel. One thing I found really interesting was how available he made himself to learning the role. For example, he didn't turn his phone on for 3 months straight. Got me thinking about how much I can get distracted during the day, and how these distractions can get in the way of me actually giving 100% to the art that I'm working on. I'm sure you all can imagine how the distractions in your own life can effect your work. Might be TikTok videos, might be discord, might be lusting over getting new converters or monitors or guitars, etc, you get the idea. So I guess what I'm saying here is that if I want to compete with the best, maybe I have to understand how to impliment systems in my life that allows me to be more available to the things that I am working on. I want it to be like lifiting a heavy weight at the gym - at the bottom of a heavy squat, you've no choice but to focus on pushing the bar back up with good form, cos that think will break you otherwise. There's a certain thing that happens in your brain when you're forced to only think about one thing for a prolonged, or even short period. It's something akin to meditating. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is if anyone has ever given this subject any thought before, and if anyone has ever done anything to get better at these things? I'm still not sure if all this only makes sense inside my own head.",

Vocals and guitar recorded over a 2track beat. I typically throw a Waves L2 on my master, just to bring up the level for the rough bounce, never doing much more than a dB or two of gain reduction. In this case I had the threshold of the L2 set at -3.4. The producer said try -3.5, then back to -3.4, then -3.5\u2026 flipping back and forth seeing what he liked more. I couldn\u2019t hear a difference. (I should say that we weren\u2019t in a well treated room, working on some mid sized genelecs. It\u2019s a  setup neither of us is super familiar with.) He decided -3.4 was better and I was in disbelief that he could even hear a difference. I asked if I could do a blind test to see if he could tell which setting was which. He closed his eyes and I switched back and forth a bunch of times before landing on a setting, and he called it correct three times in a row. He said he could hear something in the kick drum but couldn\u2019t explain more than that.\nI need a sanity check. I know my ears aren\u2019t hall of fame, but I\u2019m still in disbelief that he was able to tell a .1dB difference in volume on the limiter.",

I don't share your lack of concern, but want more evidence to fuel some hope. It seems to me much about the way information (music included) travels online from a systems view is misaligned with these values / ideals and generative AI / fake artists will just make it worse. I don't mean to highjack the convo either so can move this to a thread if that makes sense.\n\"I think a part of being a human is that we intrinsically move towards the authentic and not the imitation\"\n\"This part of it I'm not actually worried about. Human beings continue to want to connect to other human beings, and music is still fundamentally a way to connect one person to another.\"",

I have around 15 years of experience but I've had long dry spells of doing next to nothing while focusing on my career (and partying and wasting time in my 20's). The realization of how much I fucking love producing and mixing has hit me as part of my mid life crisis and I'm ready to do something about it. I want experience and I think I have something to offer. ISO: artists who would be willing to give me a try or just let me practice with their stuff. Willing to work for free, especially if I'm excited/passionate about the project. Also open to just practicing with peoples stems that have already been worked. Advice/ideas of where to go, welcome. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc super excited to be part of this group so thanks again for the warm welcome and great energy. After many hours of listening to the podcast... I'd expect nothing less.",

I\u2019ve seen this happen SO many times. Skating with people who blamed losing a competition on not having hollowed trucks. Competed in Street Fighter and had an opponent that blamed the country the parts of their control stick was sourced, saying \u2018If only I had ____ parts from South Korea like you\u2026\u2019\u2028\u2028It\u2019s hard to look in the mirror and go \u201cYou controlled the result. Period. No other factors. Face it. Now do what you need to improve to move forward.\u201d Externalizing seems to be what people do when they are heavily invested in something and can\u2019t surpass a plateau for X amount of time. I see it as more of a \u2018lack of personal accountability\u2019 problem, and that anyone can be greater at their callings, as long as they get out of their own way by not focusing their time on pointless comforts/compensations within their field.\n\nHopefully reflecting on this will further help me avoid time traps along the way too.",

They're less mature than Adobe's offering, but for my needs they're perfect, and continually improving. The fact that I can now switch between all three design modalities seamlessly is huge. It's like having *Photoshop*, *Illustrator*, and *InDesign* in the same program, without the need to export/import between each of them. From a workflow standpoint that is *huge*.\nhttps://www.affinity.studio/get-affinity",

    "content": "The other bug I've had be strange is that sometimes a mixer will share the deliverable folder with me but I can't download it (even though downloads are on). Getting the full project player solves this. Have never had an issue delivering for mastering since it's simple, just a single player shared (never sharing individual parts within a project). But more points to @Rollmottle that Samply is an upstart and can have issues\n\nSo good to have an alternative method at the ready should people need. Dropbox solves this for me, it's on my phone at a second's notice. That said I don't think I've had an error pop up in Samply yet. Just sometimes people like the Dropbox for a complicated delivery",

This is complete minutia but you all include track order numbers in your session file names and bounces for mixing/producing projects? It seems tough because these things can change last minute but also I find it nice to include the info when there is a defined order. For mastering folks, do you have a favorite way to receive info about the track sequence (i.e. each track gets a number in front of it, separate PDF with this info, email message)?",

Initially I was really annoyed by the delay that it took to bounce emails from my @gmail domain to apple mail, but i slowly got used to it. Sometimes emails that get sent to my alternate email show up in apple mail as read which is annoying too. \n\nOther than that things are okay. Even though you can look at each account's inbox individually, it does put every accounts messages into the main inbox too. If you're just annoyed by having 8000+ unread emails on an account that you generally don't want to receive notifications for, set up a rule to mark any emails in that account as read.",

It seems like streaming is about as easy as it\u2019s going to get, and I don\u2019t really hear any Spotify users with qualms about their experience.\n\nI do wonder if artists will become less partial to Spotify over time though. It seems like there are so many different metrics of success now (Spotify streams, instagram followers, tik tok followers are the main ones I think of) that aren\u2019t always mutually inclusive of each other. And I wonder if that takes a little weight off of streaming numbers being the only metric that legitimizes an artist. And I hear people like Ryan Tedder talk about the importance of \u201cworld building\u201d for artists now - I wonder if fans of artists will care more about being part of that artist\u2019s ecosystem than the artist\u2019s music being a part of their music library. I think of how K Pop bands sell crazy numbers of physical copies as an example. They can still stream the music but it seems like there are more variables now.\n\nThinking out loud a little bit, I might have just said absolutely nothing with a lot of words lol.",
