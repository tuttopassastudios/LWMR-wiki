You work on 15+ songs a day as an ME, you hear aberrant clicks and pops in *nearly every single one of them* \n\nWith asking the person who sent you the files to do it, you spend your whole day emailing and managing files. It takes longer to open gmail than it does to zap the click. \n\nAnd think of the logical conclusion of asking the mixing engineer to fix the edit. They don\u2019t have the edit, they have the comp. So then if you extend the logic they have to hit up the producer, and MAYBE the producer has to hit up the recording engineer if you really wanna \u201cget to the source\u201d. It\u2019s like the meme of the producer who didn\u2019t want to use splice because it was cheating and ended up farming sheep to get skin to make his own drumheads. Just do the fucking work. There\u2019s no time to email back and forth about things that can be fixed immediately",

    "content": "Jumping in way late to this conversation, but some thoughts:\n\nI'm broadly on board with @Rollmottle 's sentiments that no one is owed anything, especially in this line of work. That said, all music industry professionals, from mastering engineers to songwriters to musicians, increasingly are in a place where they need to prove why they're worth a premium cost. Premium is no longer newbie engineer vs. Serban, it's free plugins (or the artist's friend with a laptop full of cracked software) vs someone with reps at all. Maybe right now, the \"premium\" cost of engineering is minimum wage, but that is sadly still much more expensive than slapping CLA vocal and Ozone on your track with well-produced Splice loops. So why is your service worth more than that? It's an honest question that we all face.\n\nI believe in the value of educating a client in why what we do costs what it does, but I'm not going to lose sleep over someone that can't see it. I see a ton of up-and-comers over valuing their worth and losing out on gigs because they don't understand how far they have to go. Engineers are often just as guilty at overvaluing themselves as artists are at undervaluing them. \n\nThe one thing that does seem to still hold true in 2023 is that people that are doing consistently good work keep getting hired. And track records of reliability, decent (not even great!) work, and some credits that someone's heard of are all things to point to when talking about price. @Deleted User made a point of someone wanting him, but not seeing his value, and that's a particularly tough spot. Sometimes, you've just got to walk away from those people, as good as it feels to be in demand by someone.",

For IRs, it\u2019s my understanding that they need white noise (same level at all frequencies), but I don\u2019t know which one is correct. I might be doing something wrong, would love to know more about this",
