    "content": "Today I got a reminder of how important love and care are in what we do. Just wanna give a shoutout to @Nomograph Mastering for all the wisdom shared here on that topic.\n\nLong story short \u2014 I agreed to mix a track for an American rapper who had already been turned down by some A-list mixers, even though the guy had a decent budget. The reason was kinda obvious: he\u2019s got a personality that leans toward OCD, with everything that comes with that \u2014 defensive tone in convos, super long mix notes, and weird stuff like thinking a file sounds different just because it was renamed. (I forgot to label one file as \u201cref. limited\u201d like the previous versions, and even though it was literally the exact same file, he swore the \u201cnon-limited\u201d one had a different top end.)\n\nStuff like that made me seriously consider walking away from the project like the others did \u2014 I could just feel the back-and-forth drama coming. But after my first instinct, I remembered a lot of what\u2019s been talked about here: love, care, and being open to the music and the art. So I decided to try empathy instead of just being a jerk out of frustration.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. After taking a bit of time to really talk to him and show I genuinely wanted to help \u2014 not just as a mixer, but as a human \u2014 I learned he\u2019s totally burnt out and running on fumes 'cause he just became a dad. And I totally get that, since my first kid was born a month ago too. That connection shifted the whole vibe. The next round of notes actually made sense, and we ended up approving the first mix by version 4 \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad at all. Happy client, job done.\n\nNot saying you should hang onto toxic clients, but it was a solid reminder: don\u2019t always go with your first reaction. Sometimes just showing a little care  about the person on the other side can change everything. It did for me this time. And tbh, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve handled it this way if I hadn\u2019t read some of the stuff shared here. So thanks, y\u2019all. This place is gold.",

If you need to find a day job or side hustle to stay afloat, that's not failure. That's responsible. If the feeling of your wife's support is making you feel guilty, then it might be a signal to take some action to address that feeling. Music will always be there, and it's not an all-or-nothing proposition. \n\nI'm not trying to prescribe the way out of this, but give yourself some grace and permission to navigate it.

I realized that what they were asking all along is \u201cAm I somebody?\u201d\n\nThey are working changing my oil or whatever and looking for a little berry on the tree, or a shell on the beach. Something to take home that day, something to lift them up a little. \u201cI met a guy who does XYZ today\u201d. I do it all the time. My neighbor drives the Mars Rover. I mean, she goes to work, logs in and drives the fucking Mars Rover. And that is amazing.

No matter how shitty my delivery or communication, they approach things with a smile and a sense of humor. I\u2019ve literally never heard either of them complain. I thought commiserating about shitty aspects of a gig was a part of professionalism, but they have me rethinking things. \n\nIn my own projects, when I approach clients with patience and curiosity, I find that not only are they happier faster, I\u2019m happier the whole time. It\u2019s SO MUCH EASIER to say \u201clet\u2019s try it\u201d than to say \u201chere\u2019s why that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d I find I learn a lot that way too. \n\nIn any case, going back in to fix or add only bugs me when I think I\u2019m supposed to be done. If I can stay open, then opening a session feels a lot easier. \n\nSo I guess my advice is: you might have fewer problem clients if you try to remember they\u2019re not problems to solve, they\u2019re people to serve.",

Not chasing after lofty or conspicuous goals, or a grand ambition. Perhaps these people are satisfied raising a family, or existing in their community to the best of their ability. Or perhaps they are absorbed in a far more humble pursuit and are completely satisfied in their day-to-day efforts.\n\nThat sounds like something to aspire to.

While she was making her entrance on stage something weird happened to the sound. Loud pop, clicking, and then no signal, but seemed like the in-ears / on stage monitoring were still working. Her and the band played through the entire first song while everyone in the audience was just looking around confused. Many heads turning to the sound board. Eventually the crowd started a 'we can't hear you' chant and Janelle and the band realized what was going on. They all calmly walked off stage. Took maybe ten minutes for it all to get sorted with the sound. Then Janelle and her band proceeded to come back out redo the entire intro / first song and give maybe the greatest live performance I've ever witnessed. The show ended with a double encore. It felt like such an amazing example of class and professionalism. I got the sense that she decided, after walking off the stage the first time, that not a single person in the audience will remember this show being anything but amazing and it was. Truly undeniable. If anyone here has a chance to catch any of the remaining shows on her tour, I could not recommend it enough. \ud83e\udd18",

The stakes for errors have gone up - when they are manufacturing 100k copies of vinyl then you have to be sure it\u2019s error free\n\n**Do you reject artists if they approach you to \u201cMaster my album i\u2019ll pay you whatever you want\u201d if you think the level of their sound might not honour your history with all these artists**\n\nI don\u2019t reject *anyone* who can pay my rate. I don\u2019t vet clients on a \u201chow will you make me look?\u201d basis, I\u2019m a service provider to them. There are very very occasionally mismatches where I\u2019ll say \u201chappy to do this but I think you\u2019d be better served by XYZ\u201d, an example being someone coming to me with EDM who wants really intense processing - another girl or guy steeped in that genre will serve them better\n\n**How does it feel having a connection to these artists?**\n\nIt feels really nice to be trusted with people\u2019s art, when someone like a St. Vincent says \u201cyeah, this is good\u201d it matters to me, she has great ears and taste so it feels good to hit a mark\n\nIt\u2019s also very special to hear these things come out of the speaker for the first time - I\u2019ll never forget hearing Nick Cave, or Taylor or Lana in the room for the first time. It\u2019s a privilege to be trusted with their art\n\n**but does it ever happen that you are wanting more?\u201d**\n\nI\u2019m human and can be reliably trusted to do all the silly human things like being greedy, insecure, fearful etc. but every year I get a little better at living a better way, and around the music in particular my operating principles \u201cThe why\u201d feel better and truer than they ever have",

Instead of chumming it up with the band trying to fend off boredom while Eric was mid task, I stuck around on the couch\u2026 watching patiently. Those were the moments where he would start looping me into what he was doing, explaining his techniques. Before I knew it, I could start anticipating what he would need next. Someone mentions trying some vocals on a thing? I immediately got going on setting up a mic, getting headphones, even starting to dial in a mix on the headphone box. Percussion? Grab the trunk of junk and start laying out potential options. Once I started actually being useful, I\u2019d be given real tasks. \u201cHey, do you think you could try doing a preliminary comp of this vocal?\u201d I had been in the room for all the vocal takes, heard the discussion about approach and vibe, even made the singers coffee the right way\u2026 why not? That evolved into being trusted with recording stuff in the second studio\u2026 we were always running behind, and having me chip away at guitar tracking or re-amping was really useful. Years of this and we were a well oiled machine. I\u2019d get looped into pre-production phone calls and meetings, he would start asking my opinion on things.. drum sounds, microphone choices.",

This role is changing, and we'd all be smart to understand where it's headed.\n\nI get hired to finish songs a lot. Usually that means I have a \"co-producer\" credit. Sometimes it means \"mixer\" credit. Occasionally it's included \"mastering.\" But really what I'm hired for is that combination of experience and technical knowledge. I'm an outside ear who knows how to fix what's missing. This role of \"finisher\" is really where a lot of the producer/ mixer/ mastering engineer profession is headed. The distinction between those roles is getting blurrier. \n\nMixing engineers have moved from pulling up faders on the console and creating a mix (old school \"mixers\") to often just pulling up the rough mix of stems and making finishing touches (Jon, Manny, Serban, Tony, Bainz, etc.).\n\nIn this way, the \"mixing engineer\" profession is moving away from manipulating raw sounds to manipulating nearly finished mixes. This is sounding more and more like what a \"mastering engineer\" does. Now there's \"stem mixing\" and \"stem mastering\" too, further blurring the lines. These are all just slightly different configurations of the same thing. Who do you hire to get perspective and then act on it?\n\nThose of us that are finishers or mixers or mastering engineers or whatever would be smart to think about how to adapt to the direction this is all headed. \n\nI want us all to win. I think we need to step back and expand how we think about the roles. It's the best way for us all to have careers.",

I get overwhelmed very easily, so I find that this is often needed. BUT, if you\u2019re gonna go armadillo, then you wanna really commit to it until you feel a bit calmer and collected. Which leads to the next point \n\n2) sometimes I lie to myself that I\u2019m taking a break but do a few spurts of work because I feel useless not doing work. I\u2019ve learned that this needs to be avoided or else the \u201cbreak\u201d will be extended into a longer period of time, and I\u2019d be doing little work here and there but also not get anything done properly. It takes a bit of commitment to take a proper break, and in order  to be able to commit to it - recognizing it as a part of maintenance routine to stay well functioning is really important in my experience. I am pretty bad at pacing myself and managing my own mental and physical wellness, so I am working towards being able to put the brake on early enough so that I don\u2019t crash or skid away into a crash \ud83d\ude02\n\n3) to deal with that feeling of feeling useless, I found that doing things that I wanted to do can help once I have gotten calmer by being in armadillo state for a bit. Getting straight back to work from here for me is extremely difficult, so I start with the combination of taking care of chores that got backed up from busy life and doing what I desire outside of work life. Could be trying a new restaurant, picking up a new hobby or getting back to the hobby that gone on hold due to work life",

    "content": "i think the premise of this stems from the constant fight that i feel like we all face....wanting something to be the \"best\" it can be (at least in our personal minds and perspectives) vs the sometimes reality that we are hired to do a \"job\" and not everything is going to meet our expectations of what we personally think is great, because at the end of the day, we aren't the artist...or in some cases, even the intended audience. with that said...if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. / might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it...so who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. this is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world...but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

That alien sound came about because extremely loose muscles create far less sympathetic intermodulation which sounds cleaner. It\u2019s the same as how a speaker makes your desk vibrate and create out of time interference pattern distortions. Muscle tension creates hard surfaces that do the same when singing and opera singers obsess over undoing this. This is a big reason why so many of your favorite vocalists are opioid and benzo addicts. It\u2019s not just culture. Downers are performance enhancing here. (Please don\u2019t get any ideas artists) \n\nThe modern pop voice is just maintaining that exaggerated opera looseness but with adaptations for the modern medium: English diphthongs instead of Latin ones, way less air in their lungs because the target is a foot from their mouth instead of 50 feet, and softened fricatives because a capsule right in front of the mouth harshly exaggerates fricatives. \n\nFrom a physics perspective it\u2019s the perfectly optimized way to sing in 2024. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance sounds like",

We'd been having a reoccurring friction in our relationship where she thought that I wasn't taking things seriously enough. Not everything, mind you, but there were certain scenarios where my humor was dismaying to her.\n\nEventually, what we discovered by accident one evening when exploring our personal values was that we both had very different understandings about the role and purpose of humor.\n\nTo me humor is a playground for creativity, trying things out, and testing ideas. It's play. To her, humor was something that she had come to know as a defense mechanism for defusing tense situations. She was very explicit about that.\n\nAs a result of these unvoiced beliefs there were moments where I was being playful and she would interpret it as me changing the subject or downplaying something. She thought I was being defensive. This difference in beliefs was hidden to both of us and it was leading us into frustration because we thought we had the same understanding of what something was.\n\nI'm rambling a bit at this point, but It's always a huge relief when you manage to uncover the unspoken assumptions that you or another person are holding.",

What if we think of agency, or the qualities of having agency no matter what term we use, as the norm? As in EVERYONE has it. And whether or not we are able to fulfill those qualities and/or desires is due to limiting factors, whether they are external forces (class system, institutional racism, gender discrimination, war, peer pressure, financial hardship, lack of resources, etc) or internal struggles (fear, self-doubt, depression, addiction, laziness, inner saboteur, etc) or any combination thereof.

Mine is that I wake up almost exactly at the same time every day, will work out at similar times (if possible), literally eat the same thing basically every day before during the work day, coffee at similar times, have  the same routine when I sit down to start work. Not all of that is possible or useful for everyone, but I think we can all find something that would focus us in a way that's useful and ablet to be put into practice for us.\n\nTruly I find it helps a lot. We are physical beings, how our systems and bodies interact can definitely matter, especially in our ability to be available to the music.\n\nThat said, sometimes things happen and you gotta go. You will be tired, stressed, whatever. You have to do excellent work under those conditions too, it might be the most important skill if we are being honest about making a career of this. So training specifically for when you feel rough is definitely something I personally find important.

Having computers on stage is always risky especially when you don\u2019t NEED it\n2. There are better solutions for live guitar without using a $2000 computer. I use HX Stomps or helix on most gigs as well as kempers. These allow for midi changeable patches from playback as well as zero latency performance. Also they sound pretty great and have everything you could need in them!\n3. If you use one of the above units you can back them up to your computer or thumb drive and in the event that one bites the dust, you can go buy one at your local guitar center and play the show instead of having to buy a new computer, authorize plugs, etc. \nJust my two cents!",

Many people working in audio have never even seen such a machine. They are complicated - there are techs who work on consoles who won\u2019t touch cutting lathes. IMO the best lathes were made by Neumann in the 70s/early 80s, and that was a long time ago. You have a TON of electronics and mechanics that need to be refurbished / restored to get the lathe to make some great cuts. Some engineers are cutting on some nicely restored systems and some are using some OLD stuff which should have been pulled for maintenance decades ago. Imagine if 50% of the records today were mastered on 50 year old loudspeakers with blown drivers and mismatched crossovers. We might notice.",

There was a very \u201calive\u201d life to the hardware that really transformed the keys part -~~ the soundtoys sounded comparatively like a blurry stereo gauze around the sound (but can be cool as its own thing).~~ [*That was my memory this morning of what it sounded like in 2019 - see edit below though, I now disagree with my memory*] \n\nThe closest I got to the \u201cspirit\u201d of the hardware was the microshift section of the Ultrachannel strip. It\u2019s definitely not for everything, but on that occasion it made the most sense.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s interested I can share some of the channels (wurli, gtrs, and BVs) and the hardware H3000 returns I printed so you can see for yourself what gets you there.\n\n\n[*Out of interest I reopened the session just now and tried out Soundtoys Microshift again - it's not bad at all. I'd even say that somehow sonically it's closer to the hardware than Ultrachannel, but still I think Ultrachannel gets closer to the spirit/vibe/neurophysiological impact of the hardware H3000 patch.*\n\n*Here's the patch I made in Ultrachannel - if anyone wants the session with parts to compare, DM me: https://strongroomstudios-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ross_strongroom_com/EvlK_gdag9dFhrmOQasFPt0BCPTv0qnr3Hiu3dwoLx5DrQ?e=A2m9u7*]",

I know Spotify is king and it makes sense to listen to what everyone else is listening to, but I'm enjoying the sonics of this so far. I also appreciate their very thorough credits section. It's so rad to be able to get in-depth info on who was involved on specific songs/recordings. What say ye?",

But his setup was just incredibly different than mine; he uses Studio One, I use pro tools (he\u2019s also used to Pro tools and recently bailed on it). He\u2019s using a combo of Antelope Discrete 8 and an Audient ASP880 and some good outboard pres (Vintech and Summit audio). His monitoring killed me, some small dynaudios which sounded okay and some ProAc\u2019s. He had some decent mics. I brought my 8 Channels of UTA and a bunch of mics and was there just to put our heads together, and I was going mostly press record so he could drum for his bands record.\n\nAnyway, we spent about 4+ hours trouble shooting Studio One, his computer, and the interfaces -eventually finding out one of his AD/DA channels was so messed up it sounded like a ribbon mic when it was a condenser. A lot of his mic stands and cables were really junky - he didn\u2019t have enough of the basics on his own.\n\nSo many things were just not working as I would expect - my UTA preamps were set at much lower gains than I do at my studio because of his gear. I\u2019m basically ear-blind because of the monitoring, even with headphones, and I\u2019m working in Studio One so I can barely focus on the sound. And he used a normal Apple mouse, I use a trackball. \n\nIm trying not to complain, but it just blew my mind how much of an uphill battle recording can be just because of simple things being so taxing. We spent about an hour of the 6 hours I was there tracking one song. The rest was setup. It made me realize why we put so much work into making our process simple and getting gear that is effective and reliable.",

(Assuming, you can already hum a melody on the spot and are not tone deaf) \n\nI wouldnt worry too much about theory and super correct technique. \n\nThe best Way to get anywhere on an instrument is by Playing it, and doing in consistently. Set some realistic goals and just get going, vocabulary and technique Will come naturally if you just keep Playing. \n\nFuck Playing scales and inversions and all that for now. \nJust go learn a metric ton of songs and melodies and learn to play them together. Do it by Ear. It Will be tough in the beginning, but you Will get very decent quickly if you just do the most important Thing, which is being consistent.\n\nI would reccomend setting a low minimum to do everyday to keep a realistic goal that you can keep, rather than a higher on you miss every now and then. You can always add more practice but it sucks to miss out on it.\n\nStart with song you want to Sound like and then you can slowly branch out when the style become second Nature for you. \n\nSadly there are no tricks or hacks or whatever youtube wants you to beleive to get their clicks. Its all about muscle memory and developing your ears together. And not to Sound like 4 bar loop, but consistency, and do it a lot. I cannot stress that enough. \u2764\ufe0f",

I've done a lot of plugin removal troubleshooting and I can't confidently figure out what's happening. I'm only using VST3 where possible. Some VST2 and no AU. I'm assuming the 12 update will solve these issues.\n\nAuto-tune PRO continues to be  a glitchy pile of shit. Auto-tune artist has all this latency when recalled, even if it's on \"classic\" mode (which is low latency). In order to remove the latency, when opening an existing session, I have to open auto-tune, change the setting off classic and then back on. Then the latency returns to zero.\n\nA few other plugins just recently updated and work (Reaktor, some of the Neural DSP stuff). But that was for silicon native I think, not Sonoma.",

    "content": "@Jeremy Klein some thoughts on home ownership... my wife and I have done pretty well on our house. We've got a large one for our kids (3 kids, my dad also lived with us when we moved into our current house, so 6 people total) and we do plan to downsize if / when they move out. Current rate is 2.65 (I got a good deal, and spent a little to buy the rate down at the time - payoff on that was like 7 years).\n\nWe kept the old house, and for about 6 months I considered renting it out. I did not enjoy being a landlord, though, and abandoned mission quickly on that. I'd definitely go the prop manager route if I was to even attempt it. Portland rental scene ain't great though.\n\nPrices in Portland specifically... if you chart them out, the more expensive houses aren't doing great, some zip codes aren't doing great, but in general anything in that \"starter home\" range that's also near a decent school has done pretty well.\n\nIn terms of investing in S&P 500 or total market or whatever, I think you can pretty easily see that they're more correlated than not these days. That was the big thing about the housing crash - RE crashed along with the market crash. In the past those could be decorrelated, so \"diversification\" worked in your favor. Housing crashing? Rebalance into stocks. Stocks crashing? Rebalance into RE or REITs. Truthfully, though, that's just not the case anymore. Nothing is safe \ud83d\ude42\n\nI think there's also some psychology here. You can run the numbers, and they do pencil out at times in favor of renting (and I do intend to rent at some point in the future, though I've mostly owned a house). However, being a bit \"house poor\" sure is a good way to do some forced saving. For years my wife and I paid an extra $1k a month toward our house, and had a very low rate, and we really saw our net value go up quickly. It was nice.\n\nOne final thought... you often make money on RE when you buy, not when you sell. Place I'm in (which is in a nice part of Portland up on the Alameda ridge) wasn't selling, and I offered $80k under list, and got it. Put $80k into it in improvements (had an ugly small kitchen) and it's worth a lot more now.\n\nOverall tho? I'm mixed. Bad neighbors suck and you feel stuck with them. Maintenance is a killer (3% a year is about right IME). Sometimes you just don't want to deal with problems. But then... renting sucks too in other ways. Choose your poison! \ud83d\ude42",

The highest achievement, future funding, drawing in more talent, etc... might all come down to the performance of the group.

You said everyone's optimal version or depth of engagement will be different. I like what the OG poster said above about taking time to get to know the artist on a human level. The first 30 mins or hour of a session. I'll just talk about life, stories, and passions. Anything other than the specific music we're there to write. I find this time allows everyone time to acclimate to each other. This time gives me a sense of their personality and how to best assist them to give the best performace they can. And with returning artists time to figure what mood they're in. And how to best direct that. And always ready to adapt my approach as I learn the artist and the song on a deeper level.",

If you are able to optimize your sets as much as possible, you can probably get away with running everything without offloading DSP to a UAD system.  If you are already in that ecosystem by all means!\n\nI built a live set similar to what you have going based off of Daniel Mintseris Lynda (now LinkedIn Learning) videos that were amazingly helpful.  Also in my case I made samplers whenever possible of 3rd party synths if the patch didn't have a ton of modulation internally.  But yeah bottom line is keep an eye on your total device latency on groups (hovering over a group will display the total delay compensation/latency calculation in the Status Bar).\n\nIf you have any other questions for me feel free to DM!\n\nEdit: we used a rackmount X32 for in ears that also served double duty as the audio interface running 16 i/o at 48khz and were able to do it on a 2015 macbook with minimal latency",

    "content": "Yes. The same way you do anything in life you want to get good at. Spend a shit load of time doing that thing. There really are no hacks or work arounds if you want to actually get good. An easy free way to do it is just learn as many songs as you can. If you want to really be proficient in the musical language I would recommend learning stuff by ear. It takes a lot longer than looking up tutorials or sheet music. But I promise you will develop your ears infinitely more. Specially in the beginning. Music is a language. Every human being learns to speak and converse before they learn how to spell and know the rules of grammar. Learning theory will only let you put names to sounds so that you can convey musical ideas to their people. Contrary to what a lot of people think, there are no rules, but there are a lot of conventions and traditions, but they keep changing and have lots of exceptions. Learning a shit ton of songs on whatever instrument you choose, will teach you what those conventions are and how to use them. \n\nIn the beginning it\u2019s good to just learn every song you like as well as you can, because it will help keep you motivated as you like the music. Then after a while you will probably want to branch out and try stuff you\u2019ve never listened to or enjoyed before just to challenge yourself. \n\nThe most musical people I know, are the people who wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a Caugmented#9 but can listen to a song once and play it nearly perfectly, because their ears and musical language is so developed from playing a fuck lot of music and not spending time reading about it or watching endless tutorials.",

I agree with your perspective.....I think that we as humans have boundless potential for invention and ingenuity (its just convenient to some that we aren\u2019t educated to see ourselves this way when we are in school).....and its unquestionable IMO that the aesthetic pendulum of \u201caugmented/artificial\u201d processes will swing back hard the other way as soon as it reaches saturation. I was stood on a building site in Kings Cross with an old bricklayer under a bricked archway he was renovating.....and he explained how his trade was dying ...that no-one built brick arches anymore...its all breeze blocks and cladding....and we looked out across london and all the new buildings going up around us and he was right. Not a real brick in sight. One day someone will come up with the idea of using stone and bricks again for hi end projects and stone masonry and bricklaying will be considered art. The yin and yang of our desires i suppose\n\nWhat turned you off Brett out of interest?",

In some cases, even the intended audience. with that said, if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. \n\n/ might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it. \n\nso who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. \n\nthis is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world. but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

    "content": "Not shit talking BBC, or my own products... but on a BIZ TIP for younger me out there: Don't assume there is no reason to push for players because you have great sequencing skills and $50k worth of sample libraries.  When the production company wants world-class sound, and it's your job to create the budget...   knowing that sample libraries can only take you so far is key to explaining to the client WHY they should allocate budget for humans. \"I can create this with just the computer, and it will sound great....  but it won't sound like your example.  There's a real VALUE to humans playing the music and that extra 10% of the quality you're looking for requires a studio session with real players\" \n\nInstant path to budget upgrade.  Suddenly the expense makes sense to them.  Now you get the pleasure of hiring all your friends and deliverying something that sounds top notch...  and you can take the client on a mind-blowing field-trip.  It took me years to learn this trick...   clients don't want to pay mountains of money extra for you to sit in front of your computer and massage CC lanes....  and if they have a mindblowing time in the studio and the track sounds ALIVE?  You win six different ways.",

The gist of it is that we (humans) hear a balance of frequencies differently depending on how loud or how soft the sound is. This affects our ability to accurately judge what the actual balance of a record's frequencies are and make good decisions about a mix. These researchers (Fletcher and Munson) did a lot of research and came up with a chart that shows how our perception of sound changes depending on how loud a sound is. The general takeaway from looking at these results is that we perceive sound as closest to neutral/flat when listening around 80dB and thus it is the least compromised level to listen at.",

I bother him with layman mathematical questions all the time and he humours me. he's a good guy. Ive attempted to read some of his reference books from his studies and they are just baffling.....and like a mesmerising alien language. I have a friend who is studying astrophysics doing her phd and she saw me reading the book ive just linked.I was discussing with her how ive always found it odd that in maths 1 multiplied by nothing becomes nothing (as opposed to remaining one). I used to argue with my maths teacher about this for the longest time. I was saying that im suspicious of our concept of 0 in maths and see it as somewhat of a cheat number....and the romans actually didn't have a numeral for 0 (as though this somehow gives weight to my theory ). She trumped me with all my little maths problems and started talking to me about imperfect numbers in maths and how she believes that these reveal that we are fundamentally misunderstanding something foundational about our own existence and that one day she hopes someone will discover a new numerical system that can resolve these numbers . I love a good science/metaphysical debate....sub atomic science, art, buddhism , taoism , maths they all start to speak the same (wave based language ).",

There's a *lot* of productivity porn out there.\n\nI've been managing a small business for the last 5 years and it's a lot of information to keep track of. Notes, thoughts, ideas, receipts, photos, payroll, reminders, plans, parts, etc. Often I need to recall stuff that happened 8 months ago and that requires me to be meticulous in my organization.\n\nOn top of that, I'm ramping up into work with a second company that has the potential to draw on every single skill set and interest that I have. Having the tools to draw disparate connections between my past knowledge and the new ventures with this company could be a huge multiplier for what I can do. It's currently helping me to map out the idea space for this company and really get a big picture of everything that's going on.\n\nI'm a big believer that human memory is fallible and prone to unwitting revisions and mis-recollections that distort events. Even in ways that are benign. Every read is a write. So it's important to unload the important stuff in a place where it won't spoil and distort with time. You could say I'm big on long-term memory and a bit weak on short-term memory.\n\nI'm also a glutton for information, and offloading things and storing them \"externally\" allows me to unburden myself and not get overwhelmed by it all. I consider a lot of what I do to be trading in information and drawing connections. Some of my long-term personal projects revolve around topics like slow, imperceptible, change and there's simply no way to begin to observe that stuff unless I have rock-solid documentation and data that I can call on twenty years from now.",

The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nI want to add to what Ruair\u00ed and Matt B said with another perspective. I've had the privilege of working in some very professional settings, where everyone needs to fade into the background to do their jobs properly, and that's absolutely the case at higher levels. And it makes things work. And everyone's cool about it.\n\nBut much of my work has been as producer, assistant producer or project manager/fixer for people working at decidedly lower levels. \n\nAnd idk how it is in other countries, but we have a glut of people here in the US who have a certificate from a for-profit recording school that says they know what they're doing, who think they're *the shit* for being in the room with some viral star off YouTube/Instagram/TikTok. But don't know how to use a damn patch bay. \n\nAnd when you're on the come up, especially as a writer or producer, you interact with a lot of these people, and you get REALLY sick of them REALLY fast. So that might be the source of some of the condescension you see. It's hard not to get jaded when you have to wade through so much incompetence.

I've got a motto that I say to myself as a matter of process: \"Always invert.\"\n\nWhatever the subject facing me: a problem, a reply in a conversation, an object, a principle I'm adopting, a rule, or an idea, always start by inverting it's properties and seeing what you get. Turn it upside-down and see what that extreme reveals to you, then make a choice.\n\nOften, with an inversion of perspective you get something hilarious, and that can be valuable in it's own right, but just as often you get newfound empathy, or something unexpected, or catch yourself from stumbling into a foolish move. Although, quite often the inversion itself *is* the foolish move because it flies in the face of common sense. \ud83d\ude04",

Korea is an extreme case of collectivism over individualism, and my obsession about this probably stems from growing up in that background. I only truly understand two cultures from first hand experience and that is Korean and North American; but it seems that no matter how culture forms, human nature will always be relevant and it\u2019s in our nature to be want to be accepted, feel included. \n\nI believe that American individualist propaganda is a lie. It\u2019s not about being yourself, it\u2019s rather about finding a box to put yourself in for sake of convenience. i believe it mostly has to do with consumerism and the complexity of the society from immigration and various cultures coming together; converging / diverging at different pace even amongst those that share the same cultural roots- which then later becomes nu-gen X-American culture, which is different from the culture of X.

    "content": "Hey @Nomograph Mastering , I had this question bugging me for a while and i can\u2019t resist but ask. Sorry for the ping, you can reply whenever you get the time. The Question Is, Now that you\u2019ve worked with all these great artists, Taylor, Jack, Dominic, Lana, All these amazing legendary people, How do you approach your craft now, in terms of attention to detail. Do you reject artists if they approach you to \u201cMaster my album i\u2019ll pay you whatever you want\u201d if you think the level of their sound might not honour your history with all these artists. And, in general, how does it feel having a connection to these artists, i am sure you feel blessed to work with these amazing people, but does it ever happen that you feel like you are wanting more, at the end of the day, we all are humans right, we crave for more cuz thats embedded into our DNA. Congratulations for the new carpenter album. <33",

    "content": "The title and the video card are lame...   Nomograph's point about feelings might have an unintended alignment with Beato's gripe on excessive access.  I felt the drug of music hit harder early in life (when it was new and less frequently everything I did).  Humans generally have desensitization with frequency of exposure...  and people, Beato included, likely get FEELS less with binge listening and hyper exposure to all music.  That might be some of Beato's grift...  HE doesn't feel music as deeply as his nostalgia days, and assumes its everything but him that causes that. \n\nDavid nailed it too....  and that hits or aligns with the quote I pulled from the comments...  music is made in radically different ways. Does it change the FEELS aspect?   That's probably an individual's subjective value judgement. There's no song that universally hits every human in the same way(s).",

You'd think \"well of course all the sample libraries I bought can do that just as well\"  but not imxp....  its that the sample libraries can do \"an adequate\" job and satisfythe need.  But once you hire world-class players and play it live into mics....  for me it was instantly \"we could've bought every sample library and programmed for days but never gotten this quality\" in the tiny details.  The bow sounds. The players breathing together. Their adaptation to dynamics. The aleatoric sections where advanced techniques were improvised. Samples can be amazing and do things humans can't...  but the inverse is also true.  There are many context where it's got to be live players, or else your track is just \"adequate\"",

I blended that with a snare I found in the Linn itself, which was a 12-bit machine, so it sounded pretty edgy to start with.\u201d But the coup de grace for the sound was when Z pumped the processed and blended sample through an Auratone speaker set upside down atop another snare drum, which rattled the metal snares and gave the result some ambience and even more high end. The whole thing was limited slightly and then sent to a track on a roll of Ampex 456 running on a Studer A800 at 15 ips. Only a slight amount of reverb was added to the track later on.",

A a vision of the future that is exciting and has enough \"impetus\" or \"unction\" behind it to get me excited about the work i am taking on and gives me a thorough enough reason to wake up every day. \n2. - consistent prayer and a meditation practise. taking time to do things to ground my self spiritually. i also consider in thiss area study, and fasting at times, and even deliberate training and nourishment - essentially those things which benefit a spiritual life and overall well being\n3. living in awe, or allowing yourself to be amazed. intentionally finding things that speak to me or captivate my mind. it is a continuous journey sometimes what used to inspire no longer does so regualy finding things that light my mind up.\n4. collaboration/ contribution to a collective whole. there is nothing better than creating something awesome with afriend or brother. that is something that i do take great delight in. creating in a solitude - there is a time and place. yet if i am not connecting with people i love then it feels empty.\n5. rejoice. be merry. taking time to celebrate. realizing all of this can be gone. so doing my best to keep that in my mind. there are people in much worse situations, no matter how hard it gets. and there are people who currently wish they had what i had.",

    "content": "Anyway: uncompressed PCM audio (.wav and .aiff) is made up of digital words generally 16 or 24 bits long recorded however many times a second for a given sample rate, for fixed point (integer) values. Each bit represents ~6dB of dynamic range. Every time you go up in level 6dB from that particular sample point, another bit flips from 0 (off) to 1 (on). The least significant bit defines your noise floor, so 16 bit audio has 96dB of dynamic range at maximum from noise floor to full scale (every bit turned on). Seems simple enough, right? And it isn't super complicated. But it has one problem: you run out of dynamic range real quick if you're changing levels with (virtual) faders at 24 bits. There are two ways around that:\n1, make the mixer engine run on a much higher integer word length (like old Pro Tools HD systems, which use 48 bit integer), and the mixer automatically converts the audio (if anything is done to it, including fader moves) to 48 bit. Think of this as adding more digits to the fractions side of a decimal point. \n2, make the mixer engine run on a floating point system (almost every other DAW, including more modern versions of Pro Tools) - that is, you move *where the decimal point is* . 32 bit float effectively works as 24 bits that can be moved around more or less with impunity, up or down.",

I currently have a separate production/writing template and then another for mixing but I\u2019m trying to hybridise and streamline them a little more to get faster results and hopefully focus on the song. Also, most of the songs I mix tend to be one\u2019s I\u2019ve written and produced as well, so hoping to cut down on session set-up time.\n\nSome of mine are an instant \u201cduck bus\u201d, which I picked up from Ian Kirkpatrick. It\u2019s a pre-loaded aux with something like LFO Tool or shaper box on it, so you can quickly route and uniformly make things side chain.\n\nAnother quick workflow thing I love is having Pro Tools audio playlists with a bunch of reverse sweeps, impacts and other transition fx/ear candy hidden and ready to go in the session, so you can quickly try out a bunch. \n\nI also have the trim plugin added as the first and last plugin on every new track preset, as I use them to quickly manage the gain in and out of each track and so I don\u2019t have to search for them constantly.\n\nOzone Spectral shaper on some music busses and as a replacement for Soothe on the mix bus has also been a real win (thanks Jon!) Although these sorta things aren\u2019t turned on whilst writing as they have a ton of latency.\n\nKeen to hear what you all find useful!",

Has there been an in-depth discussion on live or in discord yet about musicians on tiktok? \n\nIt's a crazy scene of selling your creative soul for 1 minute of attempting to go viral. and then if you do get a popular video, whatever that one was - that is now your thing... singing into a trash can doing RHCP covers... ok, now do another 100 of those.  I see so much talent on there, genuine talent and artists who have worked hard on their craft getting 10 views due to the algo... once the algo has tried your vid on a few people and it didn't stick the vid is dead... so it's totally hit and miss based on your first small sample of viewers.\n\nI see this having a huge impact in many ways. On the plus - you are getting exposure to incredible new ideas, skills, trends, methods for being creative... on the negative it's demotivating to the nth degree, and cheapening the creative process, in my opinion.\n\nMatt and Jon recently talked about track lengths getting shorter and shorter, now 2 minutes is the normal. Partly due to the attention span of people... well what is this going to do... 1 minute pop tracks incoming? Just gimme the hook in 30 seconds and let's move on please. :p. How can we get young people to lay on the floor and listen to 10 minute vinyl tracks again? In my opinion humanity NEEDS this :)) \n\nI also swear I've heard the influence of trending memes from tiktok coming through in music in the charts, but cannot really back this up.\n\nWhat's everyone else's thoughts? I have a friend in LA who says everyone has gone crazy there for tiktok fame? \ud83d\ude1b",

Most of the records that I get to mix or produce I'm expected to deliver a finished product ready to release. However when a lot of things are at stake (label release) it's almost 100% sure that a mastering engineer will take care to finish the record, do some QC and especially keep a human touch to the art. Would a co-mixer be able to do that? possibly, depending on their skillset/experience.\n\nwith the use of AI and other systems the expense of hiring a mastering engineer is already fading away but only for projects that are less risky. Say, if you have a tape library of 500 symphonic recordings and need to submit it for streaming so a few folks can listen to it, labels will most likely get an automated system for that to make sure that the standard levels are ok and that it translates well. I'm sure there would be a hungry mastering engineer willing to get that done but the industry is past that era",

    "content": "Overall everything that's compatible works great through Rosetta, but there are a few software holdouts that I'm unable to get to work right now, so I'm not migrating any of my in-progress projects to the new computer yet. I'm using the new computer solely for new ideas right now.\n\nThe software I'm not getting to work are the few Waves plugins I use, *Wavesfactory Spectre*, and... I think that's it? The big holdout for me was the NI Massive X synthesizer, which *just* got Rosetta compatibility *today*. That was probably the big \"can't live without\" thing for me.\n\nI even got my UA Apollo to work, though it seem to have an additional 2 ms or so of input latency, so I think it'll have to be optimized better.\n\nI haven't tried installing Pro Tools yet. Honestly, if Pro Tools never touches my new computer it will probably be better off for it. I loathe Digidesign's software.",

Unfortunately, my girlfriend is just about the loudest human on the planet when it comes to, for instance, coming home from work in the evening, or making dinner, etc.. When it\u2019s just me working alone (which is the majority of the time), I don\u2019t care and usually take a break when she gets home anyway. But, if I\u2019ve got clients over when she gets home, and they aren\u2019t good friends already, it\u2019s pretty awkward/borderline impossible to be cutting a vocal while it sounds like she\u2019s using a chainsaw upstairs to make dinner.\n\nAnyone have experience with replacing or soundproofing doors? The current door is flimsy and hollow-core, and my guess is replacing it with a solid wood door and sealing well around the edges will help a ton. (There\u2019s a healthy gap at the bottom currently.) Alternately, somewhat curious about this thing: https://residential-acoustics.com/shop/soundproofing/acoustidoor/ \u2026 I have toyed with the idea of completely blocking off the door and just entering/exciting the studio through the exterior door, and one or two of these things could be a decent way to do that with an off the shelf product.

They're telling a pretty sophisticated story under the surface.\n\nLook at these paintings. There's no individual element of either of these that I couldn't render right now with Dall-E and photoshop my own remake together.

For me humor is a venue for creative expression,  exploration, and improvisation and for her she\u2019s regularly used it as a way to defuse her own interpersonal situations and assumes that\u2019s where everyone else is coming from.\n\nThis is an assumption that took us a year to uncover and goes to demonstrate how a lot of behavior can go unexamined because we both assume we mean the same thing when we say it.",

To your point @BatMeckley , for where im at in my humble level of the hierarchy, the demo-itis thing has been a real handicap already with regard to what i wanted for a mix/production (its usually mostly with reverb on the vocals for me....I want it drier they want it soaked )  but then i watched Bainz on your live matt , post the Punk album release and he looked like he had PTSD for demoitis , so i figured its par for the course. Overall, i love recording so its not a chore, but sometimes it seems like the artist is getting in their own (and my \"producers's) way)   and  so again, I really appreciate you both sharing your strategies for handling these moments.",

It is NON stop RF noise. Buzz/radio frequencies etc. my other style of mics 251/c12. Some of them the more modern CCDA circuit are totally quiet. I also just figured out when I put it to figure 8 it has a crazy loud buzz like a 3-400hz note.",

Not said in this context with a political motivation, but, in capitalism we just have these things popping up all the time with no regard to whether we *want* them or whether they will make our lives *actually better*. And no, I don\u2019t think an app that streamlines you getting your dog groomed or whatever is actually a substantive improvement in human life. So much stuff we have now actually makes us *less* happy and fulfilled, and so I always want to push back on the next new thing having had the hindsight of how these products have played out over the last two decades.

The way I see it is sync placement is fulfilling more of the utility aspect of art, while making records for people to listen to is a more artistic endeavor in service of the people that listen to the records. But the reality is that everyone\u2019s streaming and that doesn\u2019t pay. Even with the biggest success- it won\u2019t make money correspondent to the level of success. \n\nBudget for record production is now more of a PR for their shows or tours. (As far as what I can tell)\n\nSo why in a sane mind would anyone spend money on making it other than for their own satisfaction? It\u2019d be insane to see making records as business investment unless you\u2019re really aiming for sync in mind. But then, what most of us fell in love with are the amazing records that we grew up listening to. Maybe a song from a movie occasionally, but probably not quite a track from sports spot nor a jingle. \n\nAt this point, is there really a way to monetize real money from records other than sync? If there can be, what would that be?",

It's like my phone calls have been in the dark ages and now I'm finally in the modern era.\n\nWhich begs the question, why don't phone calls, voicemail, and audio text messages sound this good? \n\nMy guess is that it's some sort of bandwidth limitation because the data transfer protocols were designed and portioned out with decades-old infrastructure in mind.

We talked about a bunch of stuff but one of the themes we explored was the idea that one needs a \u201cportfolio\u201d of slick & great sounding work to get hired\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided that then it becomes the focus, and changes the way things feel and the way decisions about time, who you work with etc get made. Concepts like \u201cI\u2019ll suck it up and work for free but *then* I will have a singular \u201cgood track\u201d for my portfolio\u201d. Of course there are exceptions but it feels to me that there\u2019s something very constricting and materialist about this way of being in the world. There can be a tension between what the artist wants or what the song wants to be and what makes you look \u201cgood\u201d in your portfolio - they want mono and grimy but you want wide/lush/impressive\n\nIn our jam I proposed a kind of thought experiment, an end of the line or extreme of the \u201cneed portfolio\u201d way of thinking\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say you are here, a young writer, producer, mixer. You\u2019ve been doing it 3 or 4 years. You feel that one of the reasons you are not getting hired, getting shots or getting paid well is that there isn\u2019t a body of work for a potential client to judge you by. Ok, here\u2019s comes the magic trick. I\u2019m going to grant you a genie wish portfolio! 5 killer tracks with  great collaborators. Not hot 100 #1 but the kind of work that you really feel would represent you best in the world. Boom. There it is\u2026\n\nSo now what? You get some DMs and sessions start happening. But you\u2019re not ready. You\u2019re not fit for game day. You\u2019re in over your head, and don\u2019t have the fluency, the experience, the reps and the humblings that build a great music business pro. In short you\u2019re not ready for the opportunities the genie wish portfolio granted you",

    "content": "when we think of how language and words get created out of necessity, we can also use that to work our way back and analyze why certain words become popular or lost its use over time. especially with internet, language started driving a good part of pop culture. we don\u2019t want the words to limit our expressions, we want words to enable more articulate expressions and thinking -> both are happening from what I see. \n\nWhy does the new generation feel the need to minimize and maximize everything? Why can\u2019t we spend our effort into exploring everything in between? \n\nDo everything in between come with labels or do they become lengthy sentences and paragraphs? \n\nI think the answer to all of this is complexity of life that us humans brought onto ourselves. That is the cycle of \u201cwhy older generation can\u2019t understand newer generations\u201d\n\nolder generations make the world \u201cbetter\u201d - (technologies and advancement of civilization & cultural understanding ) for the new generation. But what this \u201cbetter\u201d comes with many times though, is complicated soup of mess. This causes overload in young people\u2019s minds trying to make sense of this world. Many or most don\u2019t have the patience to keep on trying to explore the nuances in between. Or can\u2019t afford to take the time / invest the energy to do so. I believe the lack of dimensions in the new generation\u2019s language is a product of this. \n\n@NoahNeedleman said older, less nuanced in opinion & younger, less nuanced in language. I believe both are true for both younger and older people *if they ended up giving up trying to dig deeper to explore and ponder on \u201ceverything in between\u201d*. I don\u2019t think age has anything to do with it. It\u2019s just that the disparities between those who had the patience for nuance vs those who gave up trying become more apparent as people get older.",

I simply want to have 4 discrete paths to my ATC\u2019s and stereo subs and it wouldn\u2019t let me customize a simple 4ch layout to do that where it would enable bass management panels to handle crossovers. I had to select a 5.1 or 7.1.x channel at a minimum config then jerk around with routings to get it going places with crossover points. Feels like a missed opportunity.

To become the most whole version of themselves, imho. \n\nYour job as a producer is to create a safe and encouraging space where they can explore and express it, say scary things, move forward in their ideas. It\u2019s also your job to then facilitate the process at every stage, musically and otherwise, to make sure the execution is as good as it can possibly be.

But when you think about human nature though. The one place that we nearly collectively agree across all cultures, continents, religions, and so on. That pedophilia is immoral and an act of depravity that has next to no equal on earth. Think of the furvor around Jerry Epstien, and other notable cases. Lots of people feel this passionately. And find a chorus of agreement of the stance. So a song that plays on that particular emotive center. And finding traction with a large group of people makes sense to me in that regard",

But on this topic, I find it hard/impossible to completely 100% enjoy a piece of work after the artist has done something disagreeable, taken a public downfall or occasionally if I had a negative personal experience with them. Even though I might intellectually appreciate the beauty of the work, my heart just feels a slight bit of ick -- akin to that feeling of trying to enjoy a meal that you know is super delish but you burned your tongue on a hot cup of coffee the day before. So I\u2019ll just end up choosing to listen to something else instead. This also makes me intensely appreciate my past experiences with the art. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever enjoy it the same way again but I\u2019m so glad I was able to completely enjoy Puff Daddy productions, R. Kelly songs, Woody Allen\u2019s movies, Bill Cosby\u2019s comedy, and Kanye West\u2019s early albums when they were coming out and having their day. I\u2019m resolved that it was a time in my life and in the universe and that time might be over now. Kinda like the ex-girl that you remember fondly but would never ever ever go back to.",

Can we cancel working with the mastering engineer?\u201c\n\nI ended up having a talk with him and he came around wanting to use the \u201ehuman\u201c master instead after listening a couple more times and indeed noticing some improvements over the AI one. I also explained to him the benefit of included revisions included in the rate for the master.\n\nSome of this comes down to him being a bit more inexperienced, though I still found the casualness in the way he suggested using the AI one and simply ditching the human engineer a bit shocking and also quite frankly scary\n\nI wonder if this an isolated incident or something I\u2018ll have to discuss with younger Artists in the future time and time again\n\n(Just to be clear, I didn\u2018t even say that it\u2018s a downright must to use the human version if he prefers the AI one. I just made it clear to him that the human engineer still has to be paid regardless) \n\ndid you guys have a similar experience lately? How did you react?\n\n(If this is more appropriate for #\ud83c\udf9amastering-talk or #\ud83e\udd16ai-talk lmk)",
