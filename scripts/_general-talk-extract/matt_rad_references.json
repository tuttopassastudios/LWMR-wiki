It's no overstatement to say that you *are* this server and the reason for it's success.\n\nWe've got a very special community that's been built up over our short history and this place would fall apart if each and every one of us wasn't maintaining the level of excellence, understanding, kindness, and great discourse that this place is known for. We've got something special here.\n\nI love to see how welcoming you all are whenever we get someone new and how helpful we are at answering the questions of people at every stage of their journey. Hats off to the collective \"we\" and to the individuals who make this place great.\n\nAnd finally, thank you to @oaklandmatt for creating such a place. Thank you for everything that you've made here and for giving us a place to thrive and come to know one another.",

At the lunch break, a single intern was serving unidentifiable yellowish slop to a huge queue of people on cheap paper plates. The people in the queue were all disappointed but trying to remain positive.\n\nIn the queue, Eric walked past grinning, and when I asked how he was doing, he said \"can you believe it?

I remember Eric had ones that were wider... maybe even 24\" or 30\" wide. The different dimensions will obviously resonate at different frequencies.

The reality is, for a lot of artists, we may be their first recording experience, their first record, etc and they\u2019ll grow a LOT during and move on and grow. I think this was mentioned In the Conversations podcast. So for me sometimes it\u2019s letting certain things go that aren\u2019t going to change in someones performance and trying to make it work. I did a pretty emo influenced record recently, and the vocalist isn\u2019t the best. I tried to give him tons of vocal tips and train him the best I could, and it ultimately made it so much harder to record him because it sounded so unnatural and unemotional. We ended up using a lot of earlier scratch takes for certain songs (and they feel super good/relatable/captivating even though it\u2019s maybe nasally) and then using particularly emotional driven takes at the very end. I think there\u2019s a balance of being honest/giving feedback and being delicate/not destructive in your response. Also, @oaklandmatt , your point about learning 10 different ways to say something needs to be better, is spot on.",

I think Cian has mentioned this in regards to Jon mixing songs in a few hours because a lot of decisions are made vs what Cian does which is taking more raw tracks. (Let\u2019s say indie vs pop music if that makes sense\n\nI don\u2019t mean to say what Jon does is \u201cless than\u201d by any means. His mixes are fucking insane and I\u2019m addicted to his work.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk, presented by white wine.",

    "content": "@oaklandmatt Thank you for the suggestions.\n\nI'm very close to this point now. I'm doing 4 octave scale runs with both hands at various tempos to focus on consistency of fingering and of tone. The next frontier is doing a variation of these runs where one hand starts on a scale different interval (going up in 3rds, 4ths, etc...)\n\nThe exercise that's challenging me at the moment has been doing wide arpeggios (sometimes with intervals of a 7th or more) up and down a two octaves. I'm taking it slow and becoming more consistent, but I know I'm likely to start hitting a wall as I get them up to a quicker tempo, hence the renewed focus on really getting my technique right at these tempos.\n\nI've very much internalized the concept of \"Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.\" I'm starting things slow and not moving on until I can do them flawlessly at glacial tempos.\n\n@ehutton21 I think you're right about a teacher. LA is undoubtedly full of good ones. A lesson a week should help me to orient myself in the right direction.\n\nThank you for all of the insight.",

For instance, I love love love Jaime by Brittany Howard, and Shawn is phenomenal (AND if shit sounds great who cares what the LUFS meter says), but it is loud as hell. With streaming theoretically leveling the playing field a bit, what are you guys looking for when you get a record mastered? Is there someone mastering right now who is just boldly NOT slamming a limiter and letting things breathe more? Do we care?\n\nI ask partly because, like I think many people, I incorporate a limiter on my mix bus to get things loud and be mixing \u201cinto\u201d a mastering chain, and this has led me down a bit of a rabbit hole.",

To your point @BatMeckley , for where im at in my humble level of the hierarchy, the demo-itis thing has been a real handicap already with regard to what i wanted for a mix/production (its usually mostly with reverb on the vocals for me....I want it drier they want it soaked )  but then i watched Bainz on your live matt , post the Punk album release and he looked like he had PTSD for demoitis , so i figured its par for the course. Overall, i love recording so its not a chore, but sometimes it seems like the artist is getting in their own (and my \"producers's) way)   and  so again, I really appreciate you both sharing your strategies for handling these moments.",

Moaning isn\u2019t very rock star , smashing some shit on the other hand lol \n\nIm still undecided about the arguement that  streaming saved the industry from piracy that  Napster personnel made later (I need to check back on their names ) when one of them went on to be involved with Spotify I think  \u2026..but I know there\u2019s many arguements to be made in all directions . I enjoyed @oaklandmatt \u2018s lwmr about the business side for a contemporary take on all This . My spicy take is streaming didn\u2019t save the industry from collapse by piracy  \u2026..the pirates maybe just captured the industry and held it to ransom to create streaming subscriptions",

Basically they look at an average of the last 5 or so years, and then do a multiple of 10-15. Certain huge legacy names (Dylan, etc) they\u2019ll go higher because it\u2019s a loss leader to attract other artists to the fold. Numbers were bigger a before the last year or two before interests rates went up, because the catalogs were basically being bought by borrowed money.\n\nAs matt said, Irving has a long track record of making really smart business decisions both for himself and his artists, so I was curious if @SoundsLikeJoe had specific information regarding the financials of Rod\u2019s catalog or if he was speculating.",

Billie, Lana, TSwift, etc just don\u2019t seem to have the same significance. Again, much different times\u2026which I think I\u2019m agreeing with @oaklandmatt",

I don't share your lack of concern, but want more evidence to fuel some hope. It seems to me much about the way information (music included) travels online from a systems view is misaligned with these values / ideals and generative AI / fake artists will just make it worse. I don't mean to highjack the convo either so can move this to a thread if that makes sense.\n\"I think a part of being a human is that we intrinsically move towards the authentic and not the imitation\"\n\"This part of it I'm not actually worried about. Human beings continue to want to connect to other human beings, and music is still fundamentally a way to connect one person to another.\"",
