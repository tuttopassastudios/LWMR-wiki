Show your work, show your process, reach out to people, etc etc \n\nSpend some time doing ALL of it, and then figure out what rhythms and processes you feel authentic doing. Everything new always feels weird. But suffer though that and find some ways it works for you.\n\nAnd think through it. You *could* send a bunch of DMs that say \"hey you don't know me but listen to my work because I want to work with you.\" Probably send 100 and get a small percentage of those messages returns. Or maybe you should start by posting things you love and tagging the artists. Then if they respond say \"man I'm such a big fan of XYZ song, the way you blah blah blah\" and start things that way. No right or wrong ways. But just use the medium and see what you come up with.\n\nIt's SOCIAL media. If you treat it like \"how can I promote myself,\" that might work. But if you treat it like a platform for interacting and sharing with people and artists and music you love, you'll probably have more success that way.\n\nAlso, it can be a dopamine time suck that eats away at your interactions with the physical world.\n\nSo you just gotta be intentional and see what your capacities are.",

    "content": "Now imagine you keep going, slowly improving but over time you start paying more and more attention to your hands and not to the shadows they cast. You become enchanted with the clever contortions of your fingertips but stop really connecting with their effect in the world\n\nThis is what obsession with sound and tones can become. Mistaking the sounds we use to create feelings in our bodies, hearts and minds for an end goal unto themselves\n\nSo what does graduating look like? It doesn\u2019t mean forgetting how to mic a kit or tune a vocal. It doesn\u2019t necessarily  mean minimalism. It doesn\u2019t really mean anything except focussing on what matters; how the sounds make you and hopefully your audience feel. This is the basis of my repeated hope for people to \u201cListen like a 15 year old girl\u201d. She doesn\u2019t care about sound, she cares how it makes her *feel* \n\nAn argument for feel is often viewed as an argument *against* great sound or *for* \u201cphoning it in\u201d which of course makes no sense. Many things can sound AND feel great, as long as you keep your eyes on the shadow on the wall, and not on your fingers\u2026.",

    "content": "Ok I'm gonna go in depth about this because I think it's FASCINATING.\n\nThe top three songs have an overlapping core fanbase that is largely unrepresented (or maligned) in popular culture: the white working class.\n\nBut none of them are really straightforward \"country.\" \n\nThe first song is a viral hit that seemingly comes from an authentic Appalachian kid talking about class. Despite his very explicit statements about hating political division, it has of course been wildly politicized because everything on the internet is these days.\n\nThe second song is a white male country singer covering a black lesbian female's iconic song ALSO about class. Talk about intersectionality...\n\nThe third song is the longest running solo male #1 song on the Hot 100 from the biggest star in country music (and really one of the biggest stars in the world... just, again, not covered by the current fashion of mainstream culture). It's a kinda-country-but-kinda-just-pop song co-written by the biggest country writer in history (Ashley Gorley) as well as once-rapper-and-Dr-luke-protege J Kash.\n\nThe rest of the chart is interesting too. #4 is a four year old taylor swift song that has gained traction online from her current tour so the label started pushing it as a single. \n\nThere are two Olivia Rodrigo songs, signaling a true new superstar.\n\nThere are two songs from the Barbie soundtrack. In a \"dying\" movie industry currently on strike, when is the last time two songs from a movie soundtrack have been in the top 10? I dunno.\n\nAnd lastly, there's only 1 trap song. The majority of these songs are people playing real instruments and writing more \"classic\" singer-songwriter songs. Rap music is really having a lull after a decade of dominance.",

While she was making her entrance on stage something weird happened to the sound. Loud pop, clicking, and then no signal, but seemed like the in-ears / on stage monitoring were still working. Her and the band played through the entire first song while everyone in the audience was just looking around confused. Many heads turning to the sound board. Eventually the crowd started a 'we can't hear you' chant and Janelle and the band realized what was going on. They all calmly walked off stage. Took maybe ten minutes for it all to get sorted with the sound. Then Janelle and her band proceeded to come back out redo the entire intro / first song and give maybe the greatest live performance I've ever witnessed. The show ended with a double encore. It felt like such an amazing example of class and professionalism. I got the sense that she decided, after walking off the stage the first time, that not a single person in the audience will remember this show being anything but amazing and it was. Truly undeniable. If anyone here has a chance to catch any of the remaining shows on her tour, I could not recommend it enough. \ud83e\udd18",

It strikes me as WILDLY egocentric. \n\nIt does a disservice to all of the people like us who might learn from his arc as a musician and artist and beatmaker and DJ. \n\nAnd again, I love his records, his book, and the vast majority of interviews he gives.\n\nOk I'll shut up about this now.

I've been super under the pump the past few months with corporate AV work and had a last minute session yesterday that went really well and everyone's super happy with! \n\nThis was only the second session I've done in this studio, the first was a semi nightmare which lay beyond my control (I had two hours to setup from scratch and record 4 tracks with a trio in a brand new room.. and I'm no Noah Needleman) although everyone's happy with it, it was somewhat disheartening to have my first session back in the studio be completely rushed and slapped together \n\nThis time I really wanted to prepare and took to digging in the server for a game plan. Shout outs to @chrissorem and @Eric Martin, I picked up 2 x m88s for vocal and double bass.... I'm super impressed and stoked with how these sound and I wouldn't have found them without your suggestions. (I also got a great deal on a M130, I haven't heard many people talk about them but it ruled on overhead)\n\nBut mainly, as someone who's not recording everyday, after a pretty average session a few weeks back, just reading this servers helped really refresh my perspective on why I'm doing what I'm doing and to go into the next session better prepared and focused. Very nice to have great feeling tracks right after and pretty average session in a new space\n\nBig thanks to everyone!!",

Very often that runs counter to conventional wisdom around writing songs in \"a way that people actually like.\"\n\nSometimes I feel as if I'm out here in the woods building a tiny little cathedral just for myself and a small group of people who stumbled upon it. If they wander in I'll serve them a nice meal and then send them on their way.\n\nThat said, I also don't have any expectation that I deserve to find success. I'm not going to get grumpy when my art doesn't pay off for me. I've got no illusions there.

It would give me tremendous sway over the music industry once everyone comes to recognize that I can't miss. I would leverage that influence to make some positive changes where I can. Set up some institutions to cultivate and nurture the next generation of artists. \n\nPresumably, while the hit music I\u2019m making runs counter to my personal tastes, it seems reasonable that it would still be valuable to *someone*. Just not to me. That will be my curse. I would dutifully churn out hits as fast as I am able to and gift humanity with a tsunami of unimpeachable pop awesomeness that will endure for a century. My sacrifice would be everyone else\u2019s gain.\n\nCounter-intuitively, by saturating the market with my personal brand of songwriting it would inspire the next generation of songwriters. Unable to compete with my torrent of sure-shot pop badness they would respond by writing new music that is the direct antithesis of my own brand of hits. With a little luck, the musical output of these writers would be exactly what I wished to hear all along.\n\nThat\u2019s a win/win right there. I just have to suffer a bit. I choose *Option #1*.",

The speakers were his giant UREI 813c's on top of these custom subs... very heavy... and only sitting on cinder blocks. He was deep down a Fuzzmeasure rabbit hole and we were just moving, shooting, moving, shooting, moving back, shooting, etc, etc. When we'd finally make a change to the speaker position that seemed listenable, that was always the first song he would play to hear the speakers, followed by Back in Black. It's one of those few songs that's just cemented in my brain from hearing it so much -- like when you leave an image on a TV screen and it burns in -- that's that song in my ears.",

So in that way, pre-internet pop culture is undervalued. We see this with iconic brands and reboots dominating Hollywood, non-hip hop samples and interpolations taking a bigger slice of pop music. \n\nRod sold pub, records, and likeness. Irving Azoff has not made a lot of bad decions, historically. I also wouldn't be so confident in making calculations based on a few press release numbers. Catalog deals of this kind are incredibly complicated and have so much nuance. Like, does a $1mil record deal mean something? Yeah, but to make any judgement about it, you'd need a lot more detail. Catalog deals are much more complicated than a record deal.\n\nLike I said, you might be right. But many good counterpoints too. Very interesting times. I definitely enjoyed reading your thoughts.",

I pulled this from the article I was reading:\n\n\"Building 20 became a strange, chaotic domain, full of groups who had been thrown together by chance and who knew little about one another\u2019s work. And yet, by the time it was finally demolished, in 1998, Building 20 had become a legend of innovation, widely regarded as one of the most creative spaces in the world. In the postwar decades, scientists working there pioneered a stunning list of breakthroughs, from advances in high-speed photography to the development of the physics behind microwaves. Building 20 served as an incubator for the Bose Corporation. It gave rise to the first video game and to Chomskyan linguistics. Stewart Brand, in his study \u201cHow Buildings Learn,\u201d cites Building 20 as an example of a \u201cLow Road\u201d structure, a type of space that is unusually creative because it is so unwanted and underdesigned. (Another example is the Silicon Valley garage.) As a result, scientists in Building 20 felt free to remake their rooms, customizing the structure to fit their needs. Walls were torn down without permission; equipment was stored in the courtyards and bolted to the roof. When Jerrold Zacharias was developing the first atomic clock, working in Building 20, he removed two floors in his lab to make room for a three-story metal cylinder.\"",

It looks like they offer a similar tool for social media apps (SocialFocus). I haven't tried it yet, but if it's as effective as the Youtube extension is will a no-brainer for me.\n\nhttps://untrap.app/",

In my experience a big part of true collaboration is having to let go of some control of some parts of the whole thing.  Just putting out there you might be walking away from something really cool in the early stages because of a desire to control every aspect of the project.  It sounds like there are a lot of people that care a lot about the project to invest their time and energy and taste into it.\n\nAgain - you know everything you are feeling and the dynamics and if it's not worth it to you then absolutely walk away.  But maybe worth it to try and make the best of it for another few months and see where it leads?  If you are worried about how other people perceive the marketing/instagram can't you just explain you don't have anything to do with that end of the project?",

But depending on your social circles you're just as likely to find some people who take it way too far, and that's something that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It gets pretty chauvinistic.\n\nPatriotic rhetoric ends up being a lever used by politicians and adjacent political influencers to rally people to their causes (no surprise there), but lately it's mutated into a particularly ugly form and now there's a stark divide between people who have been radicalized towards extreme political positions and those who would reject them. One group unite under this brand of souped-up patriotism and the other tends to reject patriotic displays entirely because it resembles the first group.\n\nNo doubt you can find this behavior in lots of places around the world, but America's been feeling extremely polarized lately and overt national pride ends up being a symbol that's been co-opted by one group. So people here can be squeamish about it.\n\nYou'll likely be fine if you want to fly your American flag proudly. I don't want to dissuade you.

I\u2019m proud of what we can do, what a lot of fantastic artists of all different kinds are doing from here. At the same time, I see the possibility of complacency, and how quick we are to presume that the lack of opportunities we perceive are due to how tough the industry is\u2026 rather than the other possibility. When I look on social media, the pure talent and skill on display across the world can be crippling to see, if you look at it through a kind of despair-ready lens. But I\u2019ve found that it can actually be really powerful in a positive way too - i feel its challenged me to work to become better at my craft. To seek to perform not at a local level, but as a part of a global scene, and I feel that\u2019s been really healthy for me.",

Like when the artist asked for a wetter vocal, we don\u2019t just crank the verb right? We make sure it\u2019s not causing problems mucking up transients etc. same with instrumentation and all. \n2) it\u2019s the artist we\u2019re serving. So when we\u2019re done and have gotten paid, they\u2019re the ones who have to go out and tour it, promote it, share it with they\u2019re moms and kids and SOs etc. They need to be happy with it. \n3) if we can\u2019t make 1 happen, we make 2 happen and move on to the next one. \n\nGenerally I find the more I\u2019m able to serve the artist\u2019s vision, over time the trust grows and they become more interested and even reliant on consensus. But there are always outliers songs and outlier clients and outlier collaborators and outlier artists. \n\nIn the long run, ain\u2019t we all just tryna get it right?",

In some cases, even the intended audience. with that said, if someone is looking to hire me and my immediate gut says \"this isn't great, everyone before me did a bad job and i am going to have to save the day\" i immediately question if i am even the right person for the job as thats obviously not an attitude i really want to bring in to a collaborative process with others constantly thinking badly about everyone before me. \n\n/ might mean i just dont understand the record itself. in the cases that i do take the job though, i typically just try and shift my mindset to think and assume that it made it to me this far and everyone signed off on it. \n\nso who am i to say its \"bad\" or needs fixing outside of what i was hired to do? maybe the bad vocal comps and slightly off time drums made it through the production stage because they liked the raw human nature of it? maybe their idea of life/color/mojo is different than mine and they're more sensitive to certain sounds etc....idk. \n\nthis is maybe mainly more of a response pertaining to what i do as primarily mixing day in and day out and maybe doesn't translate as much to the production world. but i still think theres some connected ideas in that line of thinking. if the artist is happy with a sloppily played acoustic take that feels uninspired...you re-tracking and double tracking guitars that are on the grid and feel exciting to you doesn't always make it \"better\" in the artists mind or vision.",

Imho this vid would serve as a handy bedfellow to ruairis (fantastically eloquent) \"moving to LA piece\".  \nand yetttt, otoh for me....the need for people to consider grabbing attention and making a world for people to discover ....which he puts at 60% of the mission, is questionable. Questionable with regards to how we currently define art vs/and success.\nI think we're maybe in a chapter where our phone lenses offer us a portal to a global connection on the positive side, yet also a massive distraction from living life in the first person ....if my approach when im thinking about art is that once ive finished the creation, i now have to give the majority of my effort to making it grab peoples' attention.....i feel like that risks changing the intent.\nThis intent of course would be shaped by how one defines art vs/and success. \nIf the success of art is defined by its popularity (drake) i think this fellow's advice must be the MO....if the success is defined by a different metric , im not so sure its the right move to place so much weight on one's relationship with the external (the phone lens, the social media) and id weight it more on one's relationship with oneself , in spite of the world.",

It\u2019s not about dancing to your songs on tiktok, or trying stupid trends in hopes of getting a boost in numbers for a week. It\u2019s about designing a world that people would want to be a part of and I find \u201cworld building\u201d is the single most lacking element in new/small artists that I discover. While every artist that suddenly has a spike in attention has a world I can step into. What he described in that video is literally how Teddy Swims went from singing in a bad post hardcore band to having a number 1 in 5 years.",

We shouldn't expect it read our mind and generate something amazing. It's still a computer.\n\nThis is something that Jon Castelli has touched as one of his unspoken services and something that we all do. Because of Jon's depth and breadth of musical understanding he's able to interpret prompts given to him by his clients and interpret their abstract requests with a well-realized result that hits the mark. That's a pro service that AI's still can't cover. They can't bring deep contextual understanding and interpret meaning.\n\nAs a client, if I hire an illustrator to commission a specific image I'm not just hiring them for their technical ability to render images. The best illustrators are going to have a broad and deep awareness of all styles, modes of presentation, and compositional techniques. They're going to use all of their experience and knowledge to interpret what my needs are and deliver on that. That's not a trivial thing to do. AI's are getting closer, but they're not mind readers.\n\nEven the best contractors have to deal with clients who don't know how to ask for what they want; the \"I'll know it when I see it\" type of client. In the case of these AI tools we're the \"client\" who need to learn how to ask for what we want.",

    "content": "> There was a noticeable number of US clients (artists + their entourages, certain producers, and especially writers - usually in pop or hip hop) who treated assistants like \u201cthe help\u201d / waiting staff / taxi drivers / some menial worker they felt was beneath them. The first few times it happened, it was kind of shocking, and very off-putting.\n\nI want to add to what Ruair\u00ed and Matt B said with another perspective. I've had the privilege of working in some very professional settings, where everyone needs to fade into the background to do their jobs properly, and that's absolutely the case at higher levels. And it makes things work. And everyone's cool about it.\n\nBut much of my work has been as producer, assistant producer or project manager/fixer for people working at decidedly lower levels. \n\nAnd idk how it is in other countries, but we have a glut of people here in the US who have a certificate from a for-profit recording school that says they know what they're doing, who think they're *the shit* for being in the room with some viral star off YouTube/Instagram/TikTok. But don't know how to use a damn patch bay. \n\nAnd when you're on the come up, especially as a writer or producer, you interact with a lot of these people, and you get REALLY sick of them REALLY fast. So that might be the source of some of the condescension you see. It's hard not to get jaded when you have to wade through so much incompetence. I feel like a bitter old man just typing this paragraph tbh but I hope I'm not the only one with this experience.",

I also just spent a couple hundred pounds on three new release n-hypen cds for my daughter as a gift the other day (which she told me about )  . Beautifully boxed , artwork pamphlets , high quality print gatefold posters , unlock web codes , stickers , loads of stuff . She cherishes them bless her It\u2019s a touch I still have an older imac with the cd/dvd drive because she is definitely about the cds\u2026\u2026..and it\u2019s mad to think there\u2019s no way to play anything physical on contemporary computers . The loss of the physical format is a huge loss for music imo .fwiw im not a vinyl lover (even though I\u2019ve tons of it and releases of my own on it ) but I do love \ud83d\udcbf I bought up tons of second hand cds  a few years back at 99p a time for sampling purposes (the highest quality format available at that point  compared to vinyl and streams ) . Now my cd collection let\u2019s me listen to all the great pre - 2000s music without needing to suffer the horrific streaming remasters )",

Considering I always start with lyrics, the goal is to use whatever style serves the song itself.  Last year, I was much more concerned with trying to fit my lyrics into a specific genre. The process was much more limiting, and I found that my music got better oncr I dropped that mindset.\n\nAll that said, my audience isn't developed yet. So it's a drastically different scenario. Nonetheless, this message shows me that you're doing a great job with him. It's hard to craft an authentic sound, so kudos for helping him with that goal!",

I have found them to be the best bang for buck. They can scan for your song by UPC or ISRC number. They also take URI, which I believe once your song is ingested into Spotify, you can email Spotify For Artists and ask for it. But Hypeddit's free tier can do the scan, the paid tier ($9/month) has more features like pixel tracking and custom domain, branding stuff, etc.",

Is this sustainable long term for musicians? Can you balance that much time given to your art and then even more to finding your audience?  Its an open question in my mind, partly born from having seen how musicians and djs in my community in London have quietly built lifelong careers in UKG and Drum n Bass on the back of pure devotion to their crafts and not so much pouring even more effort into self promotion. \nIts an alternative approach imho, that has now delivered a good few of them to a balanced, apparently affluent lifestyle in their 50s. Balanced as in, found the time to have children and build a private life with family as well as pursue a music career. And still going hard on the music , same as they always did.\nWill Teddy Swims be burnt out at 50? Will he still love making music? \nThere are quicker (and legal) ways to make money that enable us to be just as creative Giving  100% of your time to anything just to have a chance at the slim odds of making a living seems unwise imho.",

How its unconventional and chaotic design and autonomy afforded to occupants for self organization led to it becoming a wildly creative space and a sort of nexus of innovation. It encouraged wandering because it was such a maze and you couldn't help but bump into somebody unexpectedly. Picked up a copy of \"How Buildings Learn\" by Stewart Brand I'm excited to read. Fun to day dream about what a similar creative space for music or other artist modalities could be.",

The artist just happens to sing like an early 2000s pop diva and after trying to coach them through it to get them sing it so it fits the track, I sorta gave up and just let it happen. Do I feel bad for that? Sure. But I\u2019d also feel bad telling a brand new artist that they\u2019re absolutely bombing right now and wasting their money. So I\u2019m gonna do what they want and hopefully they can make notes on where to improve. I like to think if it was my first session and I was bombing that if someone was super blunt with me the way I wanted to be I\u2019d sorta shut down and just hop in the car for the four hour drive home.",

    "content": "Sorry for the book incoming. But this is plaguing my mind. Has there been an in-depth discussion on live or in discord yet about musicians on tiktok? \n\nIt's a crazy scene of selling your creative soul for 1 minute of attempting to go viral. and then if you do get a popular video, whatever that one was - that is now your thing... singing into a trash can doing RHCP covers... ok, now do another 100 of those.  I see so much talent on there, genuine talent and artists who have worked hard on their craft getting 10 views due to the algo... once the algo has tried your vid on a few people and it didn't stick the vid is dead... so it's totally hit and miss based on your first small sample of viewers.\n\nI see this having a huge impact in many ways. On the plus - you are getting exposure to incredible new ideas, skills, trends, methods for being creative... on the negative it's demotivating to the nth degree, and cheapening the creative process, in my opinion.\n\nMatt and Jon recently talked about track lengths getting shorter and shorter, now 2 minutes is the normal. Partly due to the attention span of people... well what is this going to do... 1 minute pop tracks incoming? Just gimme the hook in 30 seconds and let's move on please. :p. How can we get young people to lay on the floor and listen to 10 minute vinyl tracks again? In my opinion humanity NEEDS this :)) \n\nI also swear I've heard the influence of trending memes from tiktok coming through in music in the charts, but cannot really back this up.\n\nWhat's everyone else's thoughts? I have a friend in LA who says everyone has gone crazy there for tiktok fame? \ud83d\ude1b",

The cool part was that the recordings, rooms, and audience are drastically different, so you end up with lots of cool sonic shifts on the downbeats of each section in the songs.",

I have easily gotten 10+ projects this year from doing this. It's not all my work but it's been shockingly useful. THAT SAID, it is almost entirely from people I already knew, or friends of friends. You know this, but it's an effective way to keep YOU in people's front of mind for picking someone for a job, at least for independent projects.That's what it came down to. \"Oh yeah, they are an engineer, I'll hit them up\". A lot of work has been fully completed THROUGH the instagram DM's. It's genuinely insane to me but it's worked.\n\nI think social media can and will be what you make of it. It's easy to be addicted (I definitely struggle with this) but 90% of what I am reading, ingesting, etc is all audio based. Lots of people post political stuff, news, or personal stuff and I can't entirely avoid it but for the most part I do compared to what I realize other people's feeds consist of.\n\nI think instagram has worked for me, but it certainly won't make or break your career if you don't do good work in the first place. If you currently have 0 clients, it probably won't get you more clients. I legit think I have 300 followers which is embarrassingly low. My account is private. it still has worked for me, at this juncture in my career. I also have enjoyed the community aspect of engineers on insta and discord. \n\nEvery interaction or project can lead to something new. That's why for a lot of people, saying \"yes\" to everything is the best at the beginning until you are doing so much that you have the freedom to say no.  thanks for coming to my Ted-X talk.",

    "content": "A concept i find really cool atm is fake bass notes using sub harmonics. \nIts basically the overtone Series but in the opposite direction.  Fx. If you take a bass note, lets say C. And u add in a low G under it, it Will produce a C the octave below that you Will be able to hear and feel. \nIts cool to use on piano or guitar when you want super low notes, but havent found many other use cases for it. \nI know alot of classical bass singers and beatboxers use it to reach those super crazy low notes(some of the sea shanty on tiktok as example). They\u2019ll sing a normall bass C and then do a slight vocal fry which for some reason our body vibrates a fifth below the note you sing and it produces a note an octave below that you can hear and feel in your chest, without having to sing super low. \n\n\nI cant help but feel there must be some Way to use that concept in a mix to get some crazy subbass with out blowing out your headroom. Just haven figured it out yet!",

I remember being 10 years old at the barbershop (RIP when I had hair and went to a barber) and reading about this dangerous \u201cPhotoshop\u201d technology that would make it hard to tell what was real. \n\nAI offers incredible breakthroughs, things we can\u2019t fathom, but this ain\u2019t the first time things have been disrupted.",

Watching it spit out words one by one, felt like I was having a conversation with a dial up modem. Really, it felt like a more intuitive search engine, and less like it was feeding me anything I couldn't attain in other ways (through more effort).\n\nI asked it some questions about where to find information about programming languages and it turned up some helpful resources. I spent awhile asking it to code some things for me and it did so impressively, while leaving bits in the code that explained what it was doing. I can see that being massively useful for bug-hunting, but also as a learning tool. I was fascinated when I asked it to code me a GUI for this fake program and it complied. But when I asked it to show me what that would actually look like, it linked to an IMGUR image that didn't exist.\n\nIf I walked away with one feeling, it was curiosity, instead of anything negative.",

I dont disagree with you that what you are both describing is true for where we are at currently and have been for some time. im trying (badly) to not promote my view as opposed to the views shared by the engineers in the discussion im referencing....but fwiw , in 2022 the global recording revenue i think was around 20 billion dollars. Thats a lot of dough. Im not a socialist....im not against the free market.......the discussion was centred around the growing leverage engineers have in the industry and whether that is being marketed effectively to increase the price of the skilled labour engineers provide. When i first started getting indie production deals i was adviesd in the music business, when it comes to discussing deals, everyone's friends...when it comes to paying on those deals......no-one's friends....its only business. I have found this to be true and have no objection to it.",

    "content": "I guess it depends heavily on scale. $40 a month just to keep the doors open sounds steep for an artist who isn't already selling merch at a consistent rate. I haven't looked at Shopify's print on demand pricing, but in general POD is much higher cost than bulk screen printing t-shirts (for example). So if you're a band selling at the scale where $40/mo. on a slow month isn't your *entire* profit margin, it seems like investing in a run of merch would pay for itself.\n\nNow this is completely different if you look at it from the perspective of a clothing brand, where the goal is to have a diversity of designs available at all times, without the need for warehousing and a huge startup cost, and to consistently push sales to a customer base that's devoted to *the merch*. I can't imagine the vast majority of DistroKid artists are going that hard on ecommerce, but they could sure benefit from having their POD merch visible on their Spotify profile. The small artists I work with would probably be better off putting $40 into Instagram ads every month.",

Making the best music possible keeps me sane while I work on establishing my career. In this instance, my hope comes from two things: the fact that I'm doing what I need to be happy, and that the productivity in my professional life stays in tact with that.  \n\nI also that's think the main way younger folks can keep their hope. A shocking amount of folks in my age range don't know what they like about life. We need to give folks the ability to find those outlets (whatever those look like). Without it, things are bound to be monotonous. Those circumstances aren't likely to inspire hope in anyone.",

Wants to throw away their entire fan base in rock music to do pop (which is pretty damn bold considering they have 2m followers on tiktok lol) and they told me they really want do the blinding lights thing. Which IMO is not a great idea as I think new artists making top 40 sounding tracks is kinda hard to pull off. And then you also have the fact that the whole 80s thing is feeling dated already. I think they need to go more indie since their voice suits the genre and their image won\u2019t have to be tweaked too much and there should be a solid crossover of current fans, but I ain\u2019t the artist here. So I just talked to them about it and told them I\u2019m gonna take a few extra days and make sure this feels right for the above reasons and if they hate it that\u2019s fine we\u2019ll try again until it\u2019s right. So I guess I\u2019ll post his response today when he writes back.

In 20yrs those catalogs will not have a multiple value, but it will be a diminished return (less than 1x) ....  not a growth (greater than 1x multiple).  \n\nIf Rod Stewarts catalog generated $300 Million during the height of his popularity (including tours)...   The value of his catalog over the decades would be a fraction of that.  To recoup $100 Million would require $10 Million x 10yrs in ROYALTY alone to break even. He (reportedly) earned $7 Million from his music in 2013.  So the ROI couldn't profit until 2037 (without touring income).  His fanbase will be effectively extinct by 2040 and it's going to be hard to break 1980s trends on future generations.  You'll get some novelty bumps but I don't know how many Kate Bush moments investors can bank on.  Seems more lottery and less solid investment",

I definitely feel the \"gravity\" pulling towards making things for attention instead of for art, and the shorts algorithms are a mess that ~usually~ don't lead to sustaining connection. \n\nI wish he'd highlight that the recommendation algorithms are what drives discovery of new creators, and that the optimization is what grows the pie and the potential audience for all creatives. 21:00 \"this one helps me as a creator, this one hurts me as a creator\" lacks that nuance and is what I generally feel he could reason differently around.\n\nI love Patreon and Jack, I just sometimes wonder why the framing can seem negative towards the wider parts of the funnel.",

They may be credible, but since they don\u2019t recognize your potential, they\u2019re not coaches who will help you improve. Their disbelief quickly becomes your insecurity. It shatters your confidence and stifles your growth. That\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. But the research suggests that when they come from an uninformed audience, low expectations can become a self-negating prophecy. You\u2019re motivated to shatter their confidence that you won\u2019t succeed. Samir calls it the underdog effect.\" - Adam Grant, *Hidden Potential*\n\nAlso related are the concepts of the Pygmalion and the Golem effect in social psychology. Where low / high expectations for students / beginners can become self fulfilling prophecies. Begs the question how do you find the balance between being honest / truthful with folks just starting out without significantly undermining their intrinsic motivation and confidence?",

    "content": "the word \u201cemotion\u201d needs a better definition sometimes in the space we are in. \n\nEmotion isn\u2019t necessarily something that you are always aware of \u201cfeeling\u201d. Some reactions are merely state of mind, until it is given a name. Some reactions are visceral because of what the chemicals do to our body. \nsometimes, it\u2019s neither visceral nor label-able. Which makes us assume that it\u2019s not a feeling or emotion. But can we really differentiate emotions and thoughts? What exactly would differentiate them? \n\nOn the other hand, there is music that pushes more, versus music that pulls more. \n\nJust like how audio is bipolar, we can\u2019t have connections just be a one way communication. Tame Impala is a type of music that pulls. You don\u2019t know why, but you just want to know \u201cwhat was that song? I GOTS TO FIND OUT\u201d. \n\nPush is more like\u2026 \u201cI can\u2019t unhear it\u201d a lot of Pop hits are push with some pull factor. \n\nthe ones that make you bummed out that you couldn\u2019t shazam are ones that pull you in. it\u2019s a slight push that gets you listening, and the rest of it is just pulling you in. (my own reaction when I first heard tame impala and couldn\u2019t find out whose song it was)\n\nCulturally, I think the love for (dreamy sound) can be explained with a desire to escape reality. \n\nSo really, the emotional reaction is that \u201cit transports me into a different space\u201d. My theory on \u201cwhy do people like that feeling?\u201d is that many people aren\u2019t happy with the reality of our lives because of economy and what not. And the idea of \u201cescape from reality\u201d became more and more a viable thing for us to want after experiencing digital devices and internet.",

    "content": "I was recently inspired after going to the cinema to see *A Complete Unkown*, the movie memoir about Bob Dylan; partially by Bob's story, but also by Timothy Chalomee's performance as Bob. All of the shots of him performing in the movie were fully live - which is an impressive feat by itself - but even more impressive that he apparently wasn't much of a musician before making the movie. I didnt know much about Timothy before this, so I watched his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's YouTube channel. One thing I found really interesting was how available he made himself to learning the role. For example, he didn't turn his phone on for 3 months straight. Got me thinking about how much I can get distracted during the day, and how these distractions can get in the way of me actually giving 100% to the art that I'm working on. I'm sure you all can imagine how the distractions in your own life can effect your work. Might be TikTok videos, might be discord, might be lusting over getting new converters or monitors or guitars, etc, you get the idea. So I guess what I'm saying here is that if I want to compete with the best, maybe I have to understand how to impliment systems in my life that allows me to be more available to the things that I am working on. I want it to be like lifiting a heavy weight at the gym - at the bottom of a heavy squat, you've no choice but to focus on pushing the bar back up with good form, cos that think will break you otherwise. There's a certain thing that happens in your brain when you're forced to only think about one thing for a prolonged, or even short period. It's something akin to meditating. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is if anyone has ever given this subject any thought before, and if anyone has ever done anything to get better at these things? I'm still not sure if all this only makes sense inside my own head.",

To capture a lip synced performance that looks 100% real is nigh impossible.)\n\n\nBut this specific video aside, what real value does a video like this bring? In my experience younger singers have better intonation than singers in my generation, and I think it\u2019s because they came up listening to perfected vocal performances\u2026.",

If you zoom in on the purple suit that is an entire three-dimensional castle that hangs from the front. If you were able to peer inside the windows you would see curtains on the interior, and at the drawbridge, a small horse emerging. The attention to detail is off the charts.\n\nThe splendor is overpowering. It took me 90 minutes to make my way through everything. The deeper you look, the better it gets. It's awe inspiring stuff.",

This created the need for massive levels of sound from the amps . Which the who then took to the ultimate extremes creating the \u201cloudest band \u201c aesthetic , by which time heavy rock is the thing \u2026.and heavy rock aint doing gentle . Then that sets the bar/expectation . \nPersonally , more than the levels it\u2019s the spectral balance for me . I\u2019ve been amongst the sweetest tuned sound systems loud as fcuk and no discomfort or ringing ears whatsoever , and then go to a pub and a speaker by the bar rips my ears off cause it\u2019s all mids .",

ASAF is also very much full steam ahead in development so who knows. tl;dr not DOA, perhaps plateaued.",

It seems like streaming is about as easy as it\u2019s going to get, and I don\u2019t really hear any Spotify users with qualms about their experience.\n\nI do wonder if artists will become less partial to Spotify over time though. It seems like there are so many different metrics of success now (Spotify streams, instagram followers, tik tok followers are the main ones I think of) that aren\u2019t always mutually inclusive of each other. And I wonder if that takes a little weight off of streaming numbers being the only metric that legitimizes an artist. And I hear people like Ryan Tedder talk about the importance of \u201cworld building\u201d for artists now - I wonder if fans of artists will care more about being part of that artist\u2019s ecosystem than the artist\u2019s music being a part of their music library. I think of how K Pop bands sell crazy numbers of physical copies as an example. They can still stream the music but it seems like there are more variables now.\n\nThinking out loud a little bit, I might have just said absolutely nothing with a lot of words lol.",
