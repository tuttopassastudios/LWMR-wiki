    "content": "Ok Long Post alert, but touches on a few things we harp on around here. \n\nSo my little bro is in town- we made dinner for one of his oldest friends who just moved to town with his wife. He\u2019s a fantastic mandolin player and his wife is a singer/songwriter. \n\nOf course I did the ol\u2019 studio walk through, listening to all the tunes on the ear calibration playlist, then let them play some of their own favs. Of course they\u2019re blown away and have never heard music like this etc. \n\nBut to drive the point home I show them a song @Rollmottle and I turned around in just over 24 hours. \u201cThe reason for the speakers & treatment etc is so we can make decisions quickly blah blah blah.\u201d  I pull up the session and we listen through and they\u2019re loving it- but I\u2019m noticing it doesn\u2019t have the 3D thing that all the other music we\u2019ve been listening to has. \n\nThen I show them the mastered version. An mp3. It\u2019s louder and better sounding and all, until the first BGV stack hits\u2026 then it\u2019s IMMERSIVE. We listened to the whole thing again just to enjoy the magic and notice all the ways the master improved it. So far beyond zapping resonances and making it loud, @Rollmottle made it sound\u2026 important. Made *me* sound like a good mixer. \n\nIt was heavier lifting for him cause I didn\u2019t have the benefit of time for fresh ears or to detail the vocal the way I normally would. Also had the good fortune of having @Ross Fortune on speed dial and on GMT to give it a listen at 5am PST. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re curious, or dubious, I\u2019ll DM files so you can hear what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nTL;DR: monitoring matters, fresh perspective matters. Don\u2019t produce mix *and* master your own shit.",

I also can't overstate how nice it is to be able to easily access extended credits AND ALSO not know how many times something has been streamed. I hadn't realized this as much in the years that I used Spotify, but as soon as I switched off of it, it became immediately apparent how much seeing the streaming metrics as the first thing had been shaping my impression of every artist or song I listened to before I even pressed play. I think the fact that Spotify hides most credits and highlights stream counts is a subtle but very real reflection of the way that the company has been turning music from an art into a commodity.",

Most people have zero idea what goes into any part of the music business (technically or monetarily) other than what they hear coming off a playlist, and it\u2019s been my experience that it\u2019s mostly idle curiosity and I\u2019m happy to oblige because I like yakking about shit I\u2019m passionate about. \n\nBut also, you owe nobody anything. This is where trying not to care too much about what people think of you especially comes into play. Breaking the social contract, telling somebody they\u2019re making you uncomfortable, refusing to engage in the conversation on their terms, etc are all cards you have every right to play. I\u2019ve found a lot of power in vocalizing my honest feelings in situations like this. It is extremely disarming for people and can make things uncomfortable (real life Larry David moments), but being able to sit with and own your voice in those situations can be powerful (like Neo in the matrix).",

If I'm less picky I choose an album from an artist and listen through it entirely.\n\n3. I put my *Liked Songs* playlist (roughly 2k songs, anything goes) on shuffle and let it rip.\n\n4. Thurs at 9p I listen to my *Release Radar* playlist for the new releases from artists I follow.\n\n5. Monday morning I listen to my *Discover Weekly* playlist and listen to the 30 songs it's recommending me.\n\nThose are the main ways that I engage with the app. Is anyone here doing something significantly different? Radio stations maybe? Specific playlists?",

It took me about a year to pull in enough income from mixing and spotify streams where I could stop living off savings and only on music income. \n\nBut, It IS so expensive to live here, and I like to do things. typical night out is like $80 after drinks and ubers. Gas is $80. An egg sandwich is $16 lol. The constant worrying of if i was going to make enough that month got to me, so of a couple months ago, I returned to a freelance software engineering gig 3 days a week. Never been happier. A _lot_ of people in LA are doing the same: _side hustles are your friend_ . \n\nAnother thing i'd add is when you first move here, try to combine your studio and living expenses. Studio spots here start at like $1800 a month and go up from there. I live in a beautiful house in silverlake with roommates where I have a room, my own bathroom, _and my own studio_ in the furnished garage for $1300. Try to get something like that.",

If they lose 5000 subscribers, maybe they'd rethink it.\n\nIf their user base isn't passionate about the issue, MWTM doesn't have any financial incentive to change what they're doing. Spotify and the other streamers have Chris Brown, and I can't imagine the amount of pushback they would need before pulling his catalog from their services.\n\nAs Noah said, everyone can vote with their wallet and decide where to focus their attention on a personal level.",

First of all, great record / artist. I checked out his Spotify and saw that he had no music out before this album. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but my understanding is that he got some tik tok traction then went on the road with Zach Bryan before any of his stuff was out? Was so stoked to see the amount of excitement around an artist\u2019s first release (which is so sick that his first release was an album as well). This might be a hot take, but I think I\u2019m a pretty big fan of the way tik tok has impacted music discovery. Obviously it\u2019s not perfect or going to satisfy everyone, but it\u2019s pretty awesome that all the doors are wide open. And I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a bigger interest in songs, writing, lyrics, etc. From what I\u2019ve heard, it sounds like people got to know some of these Joshua Slone songs well enough to be singing along at his live shows, and I would dare to attribute that to the fact that his lyrics are literally on the screen in his videos. Who knows, maybe that\u2019s all bull shit lol, but wanted to throw it out there. Would love to hear y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts.",

I think unlimited music is certainly worth that. Setting aside, for the moment, all of the other complexities around market pricing, we also need to remember that Spotify's largest streaming competitors are Apple and Amazon.\n\nThese are companies with massive war-chests derived from the success of their non-streaming companies. Even if Spotify *wanted* to raise the cost of their service, companies like Apple and Amazon can afford to keep the price of streaming services depressed and sustain a loss on their streaming services for far longer than Spotify ever could. To my eyes, Spotify doesn't have a whole lot of wiggle-room to adjust their pricing and therefore their payout models.\n\nI say as much, because in casual discussions around streaming payouts, there doesn't seem to be much awareness of the larger business ecosystem that a company like Spotify finds itself in.",

Out of curiosity I went and peaked at her streams / listeners on Spotify for Artists and she did see a big spike on Monday (highest in the last 28 days). I would guess the impact is greater for smaller artists and more negligible for mega pop stars of the world in terms of exposure from winning.",

They did indeed do that, and I don\u2019t think it will go back. \n\nIt was decentralization they were after. the record industry was already beyond rescue (to go back to its heyday) so they wanted a better piratesbay where people can hear the music right away, and not the messed up mp3 that has been converted to different codecs multiple times. The platforms opening up to everybody is why someone like myself or my clients can upload any kind of music. \n\nI mention all of this to say\u2026 I think that\u2019s what they wanted. But I think they were hoping more people would use the free version so they can juice more profit out of the ads. I don\u2019t think they were expecting this many people to go premium, which lowers the value of each ads\u2026 (because they won\u2019t be listened to as much)",

They also take URI, which I believe once your song is ingested into Spotify, you can email Spotify For Artists and ask for it.

    "content": "What are some of your favourite elements of your prod/mix templates? I currently have a separate production/writing template and then another for mixing but I\u2019m trying to hybridise and streamline them a little more to get faster results and hopefully focus on the song. Also, most of the songs I mix tend to be one\u2019s I\u2019ve written and produced as well, so hoping to cut down on session set-up time.\n\nSome of mine are an instant \u201cduck bus\u201d, which I picked up from Ian Kirkpatrick. It\u2019s a pre-loaded aux with something like LFO Tool or shaper box on it, so you can quickly route and uniformly make things side chain.\n\nAnother quick workflow thing I love is having Pro Tools audio playlists with a bunch of reverse sweeps, impacts and other transition fx/ear candy hidden and ready to go in the session, so you can quickly try out a bunch. \n\nI also have the trim plugin added as the first and last plugin on every new track preset, as I use them to quickly manage the gain in and out of each track and so I don\u2019t have to search for them constantly.\n\nOzone Spectral shaper on some music busses and as a replacement for Soothe on the mix bus has also been a real win (thanks Jon!) Although these sorta things aren\u2019t turned on whilst writing as they have a ton of latency.\n\nKeen to hear what you all find useful!",

I know zipping WAV files is good practice for sending the best quality mixes, BUT it's not always convenient when showing people your full catalog of released and unreleased work. Some people in my area of the industry use Songspace, but I want the best quality I can get and they have no info on their site about what quality they stream. Soundcloud and Dropbox all suck. Any thoughts?",

When I open iTunes (now Apple Music) I barely recognize the app. \n\nFAQs online now suggest that I need to log into an Apple Music account to import my library, which seems absurd and unnecessary for such a local process.\n\nSo I wonder, is there an affordable and simple piece of software that will allow me to import an iTunes library of 500gb and manage the library without all of the bloated features of Apple Music? All I want is a list that will help me to navigate my library easily and consistently.",

Spotify has said they would adopt a user centric model if the general music community called for it. This would probably be better for most of us.\n\nOr even nuance surrounding what the definition of a stream is and consideration for the type of record being streamed relative to the payout amount. A stream of a record of complete silence is worth the same as a stream of the largest scale commercial release.",

    "content": "I guess it depends heavily on scale. $40 a month just to keep the doors open sounds steep for an artist who isn't already selling merch at a consistent rate. I haven't looked at Shopify's print on demand pricing, but in general POD is much higher cost than bulk screen printing t-shirts (for example). So if you're a band selling at the scale where $40/mo. on a slow month isn't your *entire* profit margin, it seems like investing in a run of merch would pay for itself.\n\nNow this is completely different if you look at it from the perspective of a clothing brand, where the goal is to have a diversity of designs available at all times, without the need for warehousing and a huge startup cost, and to consistently push sales to a customer base that's devoted to *the merch*. I can't imagine the vast majority of DistroKid artists are going that hard on ecommerce, but they could sure benefit from having their POD merch visible on their Spotify profile. The small artists I work with would probably be better off putting $40 into Instagram ads every month.",

Record labels were refusing to engage with the streaming tech , effectively the pirates said do or die . My quick idea is that lucian grainge is muscling control back and turning streaming into something more like old school record distributors whom the major labels controlled . A recent convo here was about the price of peoples music back catalogue",

The caveat is that singles are released once a month for streaming (full thing on streaming platforms at the end of the year, so the example had 12 singles).  After seeing some good discussion about the idea, I'm curious as to what y'all think about it? \n\nThe main points I've heard in favor of the move:\n- 1 person buying the album for 10 bucks cancels out so many no's\n- Prioritizes real fans over casual listeners\n- Incentivizes an artist to make the album, because it's batching content for a year. \n- Forces the artist to view music as a business, but doesn't fully leave the Spotify ecosystem.",

I just checked with my distributor and they do not allow for the delineation between 'producer' and 'co-producer' or 'additional production'. 'Producer' is the only option and multiple producers can be listed. I also checked Spotify and it is the same there too. 'Producer' is shown but no field for 'additional production'.\n\nI agree with what others were alluding to in that it's worth considering how asking for revised credits impacts the relationship and that caution and being respectful towards and honoring the artist's story is valuable.",

    "content": "I was recently inspired after going to the cinema to see *A Complete Unkown*, the movie memoir about Bob Dylan; partially by Bob's story, but also by Timothy Chalomee's performance as Bob. All of the shots of him performing in the movie were fully live - which is an impressive feat by itself - but even more impressive that he apparently wasn't much of a musician before making the movie. I didnt know much about Timothy before this, so I watched his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's YouTube channel. One thing I found really interesting was how available he made himself to learning the role. For example, he didn't turn his phone on for 3 months straight. Got me thinking about how much I can get distracted during the day, and how these distractions can get in the way of me actually giving 100% to the art that I'm working on. I'm sure you all can imagine how the distractions in your own life can effect your work. Might be TikTok videos, might be discord, might be lusting over getting new converters or monitors or guitars, etc, you get the idea. So I guess what I'm saying here is that if I want to compete with the best, maybe I have to understand how to impliment systems in my life that allows me to be more available to the things that I am working on. I want it to be like lifiting a heavy weight at the gym - at the bottom of a heavy squat, you've no choice but to focus on pushing the bar back up with good form, cos that think will break you otherwise. There's a certain thing that happens in your brain when you're forced to only think about one thing for a prolonged, or even short period. It's something akin to meditating. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is if anyone has ever given this subject any thought before, and if anyone has ever done anything to get better at these things? I'm still not sure if all this only makes sense inside my own head.",

    "content": "Oh thank you. I could have collabs in my region but I didn\u2019t want to base my initial success on riding somebody else\u2019s fanbase. And my plan was never to keep within my region. \n\nNo,  nothing English is out, only a few Spanish songs. But I wrote in a few songwriting camps, so language isn\u2019t the barrier. It\u2019s tough to breakthrough in here (anywhere tbh) in English without the help of a label (which I do not want), so imo joining forces and fan bases on an EP could work nicely since playlisting can help. A friend of mine, not a very good EDM producer manages to get to great numbers with submithub and hypeeddit, which only make sense in widely spread languages and Czech isn\u2019t one of them",

I'm coming from the idea that work isn't appreciated until it is actually heard, and playlisting is still a viable option to make that happen and English is a crucial element of that (public curator type of playlisting). Combined with another artist gives out higher chances.  \nI'll definitely start swiping through socials and write down people I resonate with.",

It seems like streaming is about as easy as it\u2019s going to get, and I don\u2019t really hear any Spotify users with qualms about their experience.\n\nI do wonder if artists will become less partial to Spotify over time though. It seems like there are so many different metrics of success now (Spotify streams, instagram followers, tik tok followers are the main ones I think of) that aren\u2019t always mutually inclusive of each other. And I wonder if that takes a little weight off of streaming numbers being the only metric that legitimizes an artist. And I hear people like Ryan Tedder talk about the importance of \u201cworld building\u201d for artists now - I wonder if fans of artists will care more about being part of that artist\u2019s ecosystem than the artist\u2019s music being a part of their music library. I think of how K Pop bands sell crazy numbers of physical copies as an example. They can still stream the music but it seems like there are more variables now.\n\nThinking out loud a little bit, I might have just said absolutely nothing with a lot of words lol.",
