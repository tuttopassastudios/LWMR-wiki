The dynamics, combined with the *type of low frequency* content of those genres at that time, along with DJ\u2019s who knew what the fuck they were doing, along with sound crews who worked the rave circuit and were continually hired and worked with the same DJ\u2019s, all contributed so much to this magic rave Vinyl era.\nThere\u2019s nothing that touched those deep kickass lows back then, But That was the style! \nSo much has changed. Producers back then got their loudness from pushing analog desks into the red, Simple Mackie desks, stuff like that. But We moved to an all digital world. I remember when the first pioneer digital DJ mixers came out, I\u2019d put a vinyl on and just be like\u2026this is shit! where\u2019s my headroom?!?! the frequency distribution of the music has also changed, DJ\u2019s also got more concerned with jumping up and down and clapping rather than mixing and gain staging. Clubs started putting limiters on the systems \nMost of these kids doing EDM at high levels-really don\u2019t even need ME\u2019s at all! Their mix busses are so super complex. If they took that stuff off, I\u2019d be totally lost. But they like a little analog processing in a lot of cases. Loudness, they *don\u2019t need*\nClipping, limiting, whatever, it\u2019s the modern thing- If i can help I can- and I tell them not to change a thing- just back off the limiter until the exact moment where the track loses the vibe. Then I go.",

    "content": "Keep in mind I\u2019m still very new to mastering compared to most here, but this has happened several times already to me.\n\nI\u2019d do it on goodwill. Ideally your workflow and back end systems would make this a very small lift. Unless it\u2019s something wild, better to have the client have a wonderful experience, keep their momentum, don\u2019t introduce doubt, double down on their confidence, etc.\n\nI\u2019m assuming it would be something like making sure the levels and overall tone are right if you\u2019ve already mastered them all and they are in the same ballpark, but feel free to tell me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAlso \u201ccohesion\u201d is massively overrated to me anyway, I much prefer a creatively interesting and varied listening experience if the music calls for it as long as we are not having wild level or EQ swings or something (sometimes it calls for cohesion to have the best listening experience IMO, so know that too!). \n\nI\u2019ve had multiple instances where an artist\u2019s new \u201csingle\u201d release includes their several past singles I\u2019ve mastered too. They didn\u2019t tell me they were doing that, and I mastered each totally alone, just based on the song and their vision. And to be honest those collections sounded totally fine every time as a group of singles, mastered alone.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019d definitely politely educate them on what it exactly entails so it doesn\u2019t happen again in future, and so they can take it into account creatively.\n\nBut of course where you are in your career, the relationship with this client, etc all plays into this. Someone like @Nomograph Mastering could very well see this very differently than me",

And many people have lots of different takes on this. \n\nBut my advice is to not even worry about the concept of mastering at this point in their musical journey and just make the best music they can, and put as much effort into it as humanly possible to make it sound to the best of their ability. And then slap a limiter on it to get it as loud as they can get it before it starts sounding worse. Make mix changes based on what they don\u2019t like when testing it on different systems. \n\nAnd while it might not sounds like a the weeknd record mastered by sing, it should still be able to be somewhat competitive to other people at the same level. \n\nReps will teach them something new every time. And finding a mentor will also do the same. If they can an attended mastering session with someone who does great work, it could give some great insight about the possibilities and function of what mastering actually does. \n\nThis might be a bit of a hot take, but if a track sounds very far from release ready before mastering, it\u2019s probably not ready to be mastered yet.",

It's hardly relevant but I'd like to share it as it's public forum and I'm curious if other people have gone through similar experiences. \nI said to client I could master the record, they said they had read online that the mixer should never master the record and to get a different mastering engineer. I said sure, but I would be happy to give them a test master to compare against the master from the engineer. Sent it off to mastering with the mix, test master and stems for stem mastering. Mastering engineer came back and had *completely changed the character of the record*. Did not sound like the mix I had done and definitely didn't sound like the test master I had done (which was mainly a louder version of the mix). Fine if it doesn't sound like the test master, but not fine if it didn't sound like the mix. We must have sent it back to this guy 3 times and every time it returned the same wildly different character. I told artist let me have another go at the mastering, they agreed and I did another master. All was good until the client brought it into their car and apparently there was something really wrong with the master... To this day I still don't know what exactly was wrong, I tested and tested and did absolutely everything I could to eliminate the problem the artist was talking about, but I couldn't hear the problem they were talking about and every time I changed stuff and sent it back to them to test, the main issue at hand was still there. In the end, they went with the mastering engineer's master. I didn't care that they went with someone else, I cared that my mix work was undone and I went above and beyond to try and repair it and it was all for nothing. Kick in the teeth is that it wasn't really that great a record either and I did far too much work for something I should have declined to work on in the first place.",

What I'm trying to explore is whether it's possible for \"mixer brain\" and \"mastering brain\" to reinforce each other constructively vs. whether it's an innate conflict. That's why it's an open question re: whether I stick with it. \n\nPart of the reason I think there might be a path forward is because so many of the records I mix are already largely processed, and what I call \"mixing\" many people might think of as \"stem mastering\" if they saw how little I was doing. I'm often just nudging some EQs a couple dB this way or that on certain tracks, and doing some fader rides, and making the 2bus processing more constructive and less destructive. So it's still different, but I don't think it's necessarily *as* different of a mindset as if I was doing super-creative mixing and creating the sound worlds. \n\nPart of the reason I think there might not be a great path forward is that I still want to get better as a mixer. And that takes a whole mountain of effort on my part. And if I can't make progress on that, then dipping the toes into the mastering world is a hindrance.",

Best results so far have come from setting up a dynamic low shelf in Nova, which helps to take the excessive low end boom out of play, but obviously doesn't do anything to bring out the harmonics higher up and make the kick audible on smaller systems.

This mindset makes me really nervous, like if they want it brighter and the snare to snap a little more and stuff, that should be handled in the mix. I don't want to do endless revisions, but if you tell me after 4 rounds of revisions there's additional stuff you want changed, I'd rather just do it. Why do a stem master?

I suspect this may be where the learning opportunity lies...\n\nI think what matters to me is that 1) the piece is presented in the best way possible to maximise its impact or essence 2) the piece is listenable and that impact is not lost in a wide range of environments / contexts (i was tempted to say \"it translates well\" but I think that's a subtly different thing) 3) the client is happy with the result, and feel confident releasing their art, feeling good about it, feeling it's the best version of what it could be.\n\nI think it's point 3 that gives me pause. You can count my paying mastering clients on one hand, so I'm as \"beginner level\" as it gets, but that said, when i talk to those clients, they share with me that they want a mastering engineer to ensure that their music is going to \"sound right on streaming platforms and translate well to lots of systems\". There's a lot of FUD about loudness normalisation, LUFS, etc. I don't think it's a huge leap to feel that we should also be thinking about common playback devices such as airpods, and bluetooth speakers. For clients who aren't seasoned mixers or record makers, I wonder how they would feel if they listened to their mastered record on a bluetooth speaker and heard that whole parts had practically vanished.

If we can add momentum and excitement and a sense of \"finished\" then that's what it's all about. And sometimes that's as much about how the interaction goes as the sonics. Maybe more I'd argue.
