    "content": "Been trying to think of a way in to the question about what I did without being completely frustrating or giving a list of moves that don't mean anything outside of the context of being in my chair, hearing what and how I hear.\n\nThis process for this song is like any other...listen for what the song needs and act accordingly. That's the frustrating answer but it's also true. What did you do? \"I mastered it.\" lol\n\nBut I know that's not what you're asking. For a track like this, I'm primarily focused on the vocal and how it's sitting and feeling. The vocal performance is incredibly dynamic and intimate. This one had some ringy stuff through 2.5k and in the upper mid range that I felt was detracting from the \"fireside\" intimacy. The goal was to take off some of the edge without stepping on the presence. That was a combo of RX and EQ. \n\nOn this song, I did an analog pass because I am usually able to manage to get the balance of presence and de-edge I'm looking for very quickly. Since time was of the essence here, that was the move. Couple of moves on Equilibrium digitally before the Gyraf and Porter Grinder in the analog chain. The \"trickiest\" thing I did here was flip the Porter Grinder into M/S to bring the vocal closer into the center (by cutting!) and to push the mellotron and atmospherics to the sides (by boosting). All very subtle stuff.\n\nSo, there were some moves here, but the moves were all in service of the feeling the song was telling me it needed. We talk a lot about monitoring here. When you can connect to the song and walk around inside of it, it's much easier to know what you need to do (or not to do) to bring it to life.",

An amazing time today putting my Balanced MEA 2 on insert 1, then running into my Bal/Unbal Frank Lacy HPF to the Lacy Porter on insert 2. The original setup includes a way to balance the signal back before the A/D, and i have that, but it\u2019s an extra piece of equipment that i never need/use.

    "content": "When it comes to loudness, a big unlock happened for me when I realized that a lot of perceived loudness comes from the frequency balance of instruments or groups. There's a sort of \"center of gravity\" for the frequency of instruments. Individual instruments did not need as much low end as I once thought. I realized that I could push more energy up into the mids and upper-mids. Instruments could be leaner and biting. Much more than I thought tolerable. This has a few positive effects:\n\n1. The sounds will cut more and be articulate in the mix (if desired).\n\n2. Low-end buildup is the first thing that's going to hit your limiter. Shifting the energy up the frequency spectrum buys you more space before your limiter kicks in. Thus your overall mix can be louder.\n\n3. Your low-end instruments will no longer compete to feel powerful. Therefore they do not need to be as loud in an absolute/voltage sense. Meanwhile, your midrange-y instruments that were once lean and bite-y in isolation are supplemented by your low-end instruments and feel whole again.",

    "content": "In modern record making clipping and limiting on the buss is a huge part of the overall sound and feel of a record. Kendrick for example never heard his productions, mixes or masters without it. Clipping has an energy in the kicks and snares that was built a certain way, limiting has rounding and smoothing characteristics and often \"holds\" the track in a particular way. You can't just bypass one , or the other or both without huge changes in groove, balance, tone and feel. (Swapping limiters for something *safer* can be equally damaging) \n\nWhat does clipping actually do? It creates square waves at the extreme (for the duration of the clipping)\n\nWhat is a square wave? It is a fundamental with a bunch of odd harmonics trailing off in level\n\nWhat happens when you low pass the square wave at the converter reconstruction filter, lathe low pass etc? It is no longer a square wave\n\nDoes cutting this no longer square wave to a disc for brief periods present challenges and cause extra momentary distortion? Yes\n\nIs that trade off worth while? I believe so and have itterated on this belief across hundreds and hundreds of projects cut and pressed to vinyl and then compared carefully with the original digital files",

    "content": "@Stefan Hi Stephen, this is a great question! \nThere are two issues at play here: One the more obvious, sending the signal to multiple A/D\u2019s, and then, maybe a little less obvious: the issue of how your system is being clocked, and whether the A/D you\u2019re auditioning is exerting maximum performance based on these conditions. Personally, to feed multiple converters, I use a Maselec MTC 1x console. This offers two identical outputs. So the analog signal part of that is solved right there. There are other ways to address this problem like outboard switchers. \n\nBut here\u2019s the real problem, clocking. *Generally*, and when i say generally probably in almost 100 percent of cases, the A/D converter sounds its best when it is the master clock of your system. Of course there are *certain* converters that *may* benefit from external clocking, but I\u2019m not jumping into that can of worms. You can read ENDLESS arguments on Gearspace about this. \n\nI\u2019ll say up front that I think clock sounds best just getting transferred straight through the AES audio feed to your interface, vs using a BNC output to your system, but again, I could get pushback there, that\u2019s my opinion. \n\nSo- let\u2019s get to it, you have two A/D\u2019s running AES feeds into your interface. Now, on your interface itself- you need to choose what AES feed your choosing to Sync to- so you\u2019re going to choose one aes feed, or the other. This doesn\u2019t *preclude you* from solo\u2019ing each feed in your DAW. But the main thing here is that when you audition one converter, you need to also go to your control panel of your interface and select that AES feed to sync if you really want to hear the correct sound. \n\nIn sum, I would do it this way and record a 30-45 pass of each. Then audition them that way (i use comp lanes on the same track to achieve this).\n\nAnother possible way to do this is having an outboard aes switcher like a z sys and switching the converters to the same aes output. Hope this helps!",

They just give you a pinout in the manual, ha. Not an easy adapter to find if you can't make shit.",

I had no idea regarding the unbalanced / balanced headphone option, I assume it will be the same for the 2/4 SE version. My only wish would be to have some kind of a remote controller with rotary knob like the ARC.",

But I could also argue that I could have spent all that time just making records and I\u2019d be much better off as a mastering engineer in long run, even with a \u201cworse\u201d EQ.\n\nThat\u2019s an extreme black/white example, but I\u2019ve got some big life changes coming and I\u2019m really trying to reevaluate where my time is best spent and how it relates to my long term goals.\n\nYou and Ruairi straddle two very specific and niche worlds so was just looking for insight on how you handle your balance! How specific are you with your time management when you go down rabbit holes? And how that relates to your mastering goals",

Then they use that space to encode a fold down of information above 20k derived from high res source material. The hand waving Gerhard refers to is their claim to have a special \u201capodizing\u201dfilter that corrects for the phase shift in AD converters. This is actually impossible without knowing the exact AD, brothers in arms was recorded on ancient 3M digital machines with analog anti alias filters, very different to a kid with an Apollo with a Cirrus AD today",

I have the MP currently, but I am rarely using the actual bands...I mostly just hit it at whatever volume I feel best suits the color I'm looking for (different for every song). It does do a very cool job, but I just wonder if the Fearn is maybe a little more like \"clear\" in the lows or something? We've talked about the rounding of the lows, I know that's indicative of the tubes on some level but I've been mulling maybe going to the Fearn since usually what the Manley does best to me (biggers boosts/cuts transparently) I feel is just too much for a lot of the stuff I'm doing and a lot of mastering these days.\n\nAlso for most modern pop stuff I'm in the box, this wouldn't be for that. But I do actually use the MP a fair amount with good result in the capacity of it being a \"tube box\" sorta thing\n\n@Nomograph Mastering obv you have some experience and I know @Rollmottle moved on I think from it?

(And here\u2019s where I start talking about shit I really don\u2019t know shit about) Ableton running audio off of a midi clocking design that runs off of your macs built in clock while reason is running off of the clock built into your interface or whatever.

And using chain upsampling post converter at 192 and leaving oversampling off plugins whenever possible\u2026placing ultrasonic after the last limiter seems to be  helpful but also something probably to be cautious with fussing too much around with other than turn if on and see if it\u2019s better, has extra features that are above my pay grade (nyquist hard limit, dynamic gating\u2026) \n\nI export out at 44/48 64 bit and get that out of the way and the chain OS still stays at 192. \n\nDb power amp to 24 bit triangle dither. \n\nVoxengo R8brain in Reaper, to me, is pretty damn good",

It'll help you way more than adding many character plugins and potentially getting into the dangerous territory of adding something just to add it",
