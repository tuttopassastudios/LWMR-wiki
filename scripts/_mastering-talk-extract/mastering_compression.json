As for keeping your low end in mono -- that was a rule of thumb for years to ensure translation outside of the studio for various formats. With digital recording & reproduction... it's not an issue if you do it thoughtfully.",

Then for \u201cmastering\u201d I\u2019m boring and use either Pro L2 for a touch more loudness or Ozone with most of the modules turned off \ud83d\ude42",

But to tie to maybe a literal example\u2026I have a Massive Passive. It\u2019s like 75 percent of what I wish it was. And it may well be possible for me to learn and build a better version of it with my background knowledge, not constrained by the variables Manley is.\n\nBut as you know, it would take YEARS of studying, trial/error/etc. maybe I end up with a better EQ. But I could also argue that I could have spent all that time just making records and I\u2019d be much better off as a mastering engineer in long run, even with a \u201cworse\u201d EQ.\n\nThat\u2019s an extreme black/white example, but I\u2019ve got some big life changes coming and I\u2019m really trying to reevaluate where my time is best spent and how it relates to my long term goals.\n\nYou and Ruairi straddle two very specific and niche worlds so was just looking for insight on how you handle your balance! How specific are you with your time management when you go down rabbit holes? And how that relates to your mastering goals",

    "content": "Since I'm on one today: another gear question ** shudders **\n\nDoes anyone have experience with both a Fearn VT-5 and a Massive Passive? I have the MP currently, but I am rarely using the actual bands...I mostly just hit it at whatever volume I feel best suits the color I'm looking for (different for every song). It does do a very cool job, but I just wonder if the Fearn is maybe a little more like \"clear\" in the lows or something? We've talked about the rounding of the lows, I know that's indicative of the tubes on some level but I've been mulling maybe going to the Fearn since usually what the Manley does best to me (biggers boosts/cuts transparently) I feel is just too much for a lot of the stuff I'm doing and a lot of mastering these days.\n\nAlso for most modern pop stuff I'm in the box, this wouldn't be for that. But I do actually use the MP a fair amount with good result in the capacity of it being a \"tube box\" sorta thing\n\n@Nomograph Mastering obv you have some experience and I know @Rollmottle moved on I think from it? Curious if you would be willing to share any thoughts",
