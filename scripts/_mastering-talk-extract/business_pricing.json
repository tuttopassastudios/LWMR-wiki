Note I didn't say \"most expensive\"\n\n2) Next spend as much time as possible listening with the best listeners you can get access to (other engineers, music fans, kids)\n\n3) Ignore almost everything you read and watch on the internet about the topic of Mastering \n\n4) RIngfence your time developing and understanding techniques away from when you are actually working on music\n\n5) Maximize your availibilty to the music (keep distractions, overheads, gear envy, fear etc to a minimum)\n\n6) Now listen as widely as you can, to every genre - listen for details, listen like a fan, zoom in, zoom out, zoom in again\n\n7) Love everything you touch. You don't have to like it, but you've gotta love it. Love is a quality of attention. Attend to the music with generosity, as you would a child, or grandma, or a precious butterfly",

In a follow up to this, as a wonderful surprise, had my master picked in a shootout against an engineer who is leagues ahead of me.\n\nMy master was 1.6db quieter, and the artist actually liked the space it gave (it is still plenty plenty loud). Just was interesting that this artist had the understanding of really what they wanted, how it mattered to his art, etc.\n\nOther guys master sounded great too, just really hot and dense dense. which I feel 9 times out of 10 will win because explaining the trade offs and benefits of loudness (and having it understood) is very hard, but this felt like an artist really leading with their vision, not concern with the loudness stuff\u2026how he articulated it to me confirmed that. Pretty cool, regardless of outcome",

    "content": "Been trying to think of a way in to the question about what I did without being completely frustrating or giving a list of moves that don't mean anything outside of the context of being in my chair, hearing what and how I hear.\n\nThis process for this song is like any other...listen for what the song needs and act accordingly. That's the frustrating answer but it's also true. What did you do? \"I mastered it.\" lol\n\nBut I know that's not what you're asking. For a track like this, I'm primarily focused on the vocal and how it's sitting and feeling. The vocal performance is incredibly dynamic and intimate. This one had some ringy stuff through 2.5k and in the upper mid range that I felt was detracting from the \"fireside\" intimacy. The goal was to take off some of the edge without stepping on the presence. That was a combo of RX and EQ. \n\nOn this song, I did an analog pass because I am usually able to manage to get the balance of presence and de-edge I'm looking for very quickly. Since time was of the essence here, that was the move. Couple of moves on Equilibrium digitally before the Gyraf and Porter Grinder in the analog chain. The \"trickiest\" thing I did here was flip the Porter Grinder into M/S to bring the vocal closer into the center (by cutting!) and to push the mellotron and atmospherics to the sides (by boosting). All very subtle stuff.\n\nSo, there were some moves here, but the moves were all in service of the feeling the song was telling me it needed. We talk a lot about monitoring here. When you can connect to the song and walk around inside of it, it's much easier to know what you need to do (or not to do) to bring it to life.",

Each attack/release time is given a distortion and masking score and the best score is selected. The different IRC modes prioritize different types of scores (eg. IRC I prioritizes low pumping and distortion, IRC II is similar to IRC I but prioritizes transients more, etc). \nIzotope is a little cagey on the exact process they use to arrive at each IRC mode, but the manual does a pretty good job of explaining how each mode feels. IRC IV Transient is basically a multiband version of the other IRC modes that prioritizes transients, although Izotope says IRC V is its first multiband limiter in Ozone, so there is maybe more to the story there",

To instead see those qualities as features to be preserved.\n\nThis also means not falling into a trap of thinking \"Oh this is a pop record, so the high-end need to be shiny\" or \"this is a hip hop song and needs slamming bass\" or other such cliches.\n\nFundamentally it is about listening. Not a technical listening or a listening for where a thing fits in comparison to others, but the kind of listening and perceiving that takes the time to empathize and feel. To understand intent.

The dynamics, combined with the *type of low frequency* content of those genres at that time, along with DJ\u2019s who knew what the fuck they were doing, along with sound crews who worked the rave circuit and were continually hired and worked with the same DJ\u2019s, all contributed so much to this magic rave Vinyl era.\nThere\u2019s nothing that touched those deep kickass lows back then, But That was the style! \nSo much has changed.

How much do they trust you, how much do you want to continue working with them, etc. @Rollmottle is always great with his words, and that kind of approach is key to get the conversation started. I also find that having an alternative master for the artist to listen to is helpful.

I held it and played a few riffs... wasn't like Slash changed my life or anything... but the weight of that instrument in my hands just felt *intense*. Similar feelings around Chris Thile's mandolin, or Stevie Wonder's piano... shit, every time I'm at Annie Clark's and pick up one of her guitars.

And bravery.  Artistry is at least loving and brave.  People want a leader to look up to and inspire them to be greater than they are, they want a real artist.   Playing it safe is what they do in life, perfection in the box is easy now, anyone can do Fear based productions.  People want something real.   Mastering that is fear driven feels like a product, manipulating them, not authentically connection and uplifting. \n\nOn your record I have actually expended dynamics, some songs needed more than others.

    "content": "When it comes to loudness, a big unlock happened for me when I realized that a lot of perceived loudness comes from the frequency balance of instruments or groups. There's a sort of \"center of gravity\" for the frequency of instruments. Individual instruments did not need as much low end as I once thought. I realized that I could push more energy up into the mids and upper-mids. Instruments could be leaner and biting. Much more than I thought tolerable. This has a few positive effects:\n\n1. The sounds will cut more and be articulate in the mix (if desired).\n\n2. Low-end buildup is the first thing that's going to hit your limiter. Shifting the energy up the frequency spectrum buys you more space before your limiter kicks in. Thus your overall mix can be louder.\n\n3. Your low-end instruments will no longer compete to feel powerful. Therefore they do not need to be as loud in an absolute/voltage sense. Meanwhile, your midrange-y instruments that were once lean and bite-y in isolation are supplemented by your low-end instruments and feel whole again.",

I hope you enjoy any time you spend on the Discord server and don't think of it as an obligation or something that adds any stress or anxiety to your already very full life.  I think there's a lot of information readily available from your posts and others discussions here that is incredibly useful and a lot of us can probably continue to help field questions that commonly are directed to you by helping new folks search up conversations or point them to other resources.  But please never feel pressured to participate here, nothing is owed to anyone here beyond what you have already given.  And I believe the same of anyone that shares their knowledge here on the server.  You and many of the other experienced people on the server are deeply appreciated for your time and energy.",

(I feel like me giving the thumbs up can really elevate their fears and listen freely \ud83e\udd1e)\n\nReasons for being the middle man\n 1. I hopefully can communicate well with both (translating what the artist may want into actual terms) 2.

    "content": "@Rollmottle already gave a great answer here. I want to re-state and co-sign what he posted \n\n1. Don't try and remove what you can't hear. Never going to end well. There is no general rule sub 30hz so don't try and preemptively deal with something if you're not even sure it's an issue\n2. If you do need to deal with a low end issue, deal with it at the source, instead of the 2-mix if you can\n3. If you're dealing with it at the 2-mix level, gentle shelves will do less harm than steep cuts\n\nOk. Now to a thornier aspect of your question - does throwing away super low end information help us with loudness?\n\nAs I\u2019ve said many times here our typical goal is not just maximum loudness. The goal is really high perceived loudness, and low measured loudness (to avoid being turned down too much by normalization), all while remaining musical and true to the intent of the song\n\nPerceived loudness is primarily driven by arrangement (less elements better), distortion (more distortion makes things feel louder but at obvious cost) and frequency content (special attention needs to be paid to the 1500 to 6000 region I mentioned the other day). Super low end content doesn\u2019t have too much of a direct effect on how we perceive loudness but of course it does have second order effects - huge lows will cause limiters to overwork and we\u2019ll get into trouble with things sounding smashed sooner than we\u2019d like\n\nOk, but what of measured loudness? Here it pays to have an understanding of how LUFS are actually calculated. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a neat summary video somewhere Dan Worrall style, if so please link it in folks. The definitive doc on LUFS measurement is here \n\nhttps://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-5-202311-I!!PDF-E.pdf",

Even if 99% of users don't give a shit about the perfect playback, we do. That's why we have that \"lossless\" switch. We'll never switch to AAC due to bandwidth issues.\n\nThe \"constant upgrades\" are often due to the ever changing landscape of browsers. Each client is often on a different browser, different device and different internet connection. It's our job to understand that landscape and push fixes to ensure we get perfect playback across all environments. \n\nThat's part of the reason we built the iOS app, to be able to provide a more consistent playback experience when browsers themselves are the limiting factor, and so that clients can listen offline to take the network out of the equation. But I totally understand that you can't really ask a client to install another app on their iPhone. \n\nTo my knowledge, Samply is still the only platform that lets clients stream full resolution lossless AND gapless track transitions in a browser. It's a really tough engineering challenge, but ultimately the backbone of our entire business. We're committed to continuing to solve this problem and evolve with the technology available.",

A few thoughts\n\nNot everyone has loudness normalization turned on. It also doesn\u2019t exist on Smart TVs, many streaming web interfaces etc\n\nThe different services all have different level norm targets (and even different settings within just Spotify) - and they change pretty regularly\n\nIn terms of absolute level when normalization is active what matters is arrangement (dense mixes sound quieter than sparse/spacious mixes), EQ (bright/mid range forward mixes sound louder than dark) and distortion levels (clipped/distorted mixes feel perceptually louder than clean). If I make a master a dB louder in mastering using just limiting for example, they just turn it down a dB more when it\u2019s level normed.\n\nSo what does all of this mean? It means that every song has sweet spot where the EQ/tone, the arrangement and the overall clipping/limiting level works best and communicates the intent. That\u2019s what we aim for.\n\nYou can use a site like loudnesspenalty.com to see what will happen but it will just drive you crazy and the only real way to meaningfully alter the result is to change the arrangement/mix or overall EQ a lot. On release day you can find 1000 records that are louder than yours if you want to.\n\nIf being the loudest is the intent - game everything listed above and you can \u201cwin\u201d. If doing your unique thing and communicating a song and a performance is the goal then I think you are there!\"\n\n(posted with Nomographs permission)",

For you the sample rate conversion algo may be the difference to get that extra 2%. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the sample rate stuff doesn\u2019t matter, but as you said, it\u2019s important to understand where we all are at, where our time is best spent, and when to utilize or worry about certain things!!\n\nWill be back next week would love to go deeper on some of this!",

It's the same reason most EQ graphs keep the octaves evenly spaced so that 50% of your freq graph isn't 10kHz and up. It gives you more resolution for the notes in the lower octaves.\n\nAs for FFT size or window shape, I never change it, but as Ruairi alluded to it requires an understanding of the physical limitations of FFT's. \n\nIn short if you want very fine frequency information displayed you can change the window size and lose rhythmic information. But it you want very precise rhythmic visualization you have to sacrifice how much frequency information the FFT can display. So the ideal setting ultimately depends on what problem you're trying to solve.",

Yanking the limiter off a hot pop master might change things too much, for example.\n\nAdditionally, whoever is cutting the lacquer, will likely be doing their own adjustments as they see fit.. so if you are concerned about it translating properly, I would get with a lacquer engineer that you know and trust so you can have a dialogue about it, if needed.\n\nThat being said, in my experience, great sounding projects/masters will sound good on vinyl if the cutting engineer knows what they are doing\u2026 no matter how much you try to help with the PreMaster.",

It was like a moment of me realizing that it is what people would like me to do, and that made it feel all the more right in the moment. 6 odd years later and I really couldn't imagine trying to do all the roles or even two well. Niching down was a requirement to leveling up, for me at the time. \n\nI'd wager the fact that you're even thinking about this is a good sign that your give-a-fuck meter is at a high enough level to warrant niching down.

    "content": "A few thoughts on all this.. I agree with @Nomograph Mastering that the top of funnel for Spotify isn't bringing in enough money to overnight increase the amount music rights holders are paid. However, I am not convinced Spotify couldn't raise their subscription price in certain markets. Netflix has successfully raised their prices many times over the years. I've been paying the same price for Spotify for close to 10 years (maybe it increased a dollar at one point, but not sure).\n\nI do believe Daniel Ek and Spotify have earned some ire from the music community. Ek is a billionaire and the average Spotify employee makes close to $110k / year. You would probably need around ~1.5 million monthly listeners and ~3.5 million streams / month to earn an equivalent amount (master recording side sans publishing and no other income stream). There are maybe a little over 6000 artists that have that large of a listenership in the entire world out of conservatively 5-7 million artists on the platform.\n\nThere are many things Spotify could do to improve economic outcomes for artists / musicians. Here are a few in no particular order:\n1) Allow artists to link to their own website. Believe it or not we can't do this. Your own website is the one piece of online real estate that you actually control. On Spotify, IG, Tiktok, etc... you are playing in someone else's sandbox.\n2) Allow artists more control over their profiles and the way they are laid out. One thing that infuriates me is how Spotify sorts albums by popularity rather than release date. I would like to change that. This would be beneficial to promoting newer releases. As well all external links off of Spotify are virtually hidden on the 'about' page at the bottom of your profile making it harder for fans to follow you where you want to be followed.",

I\u2019m getting similar stuff (limited, heated ref, unlimited), and honestly I find I\u2019m using the ref certainly some of the time and working from there. Sometimes there is just magic there, and while my chain may be \u201cbetter\u201d it\u2019s also just different, especially when I can tell people are mixing into that ref chain.\n\nI guess I just mention because going into my new \u201crole\u201d in mastering I made a very conscious decision to only operate on a binary: is what I\u2019m doing making the record feel better to me or not? Is it becoming more of what it wants to be?\n\nAnd throw out any notions of what I felt I \u201cshould\u201d be doing.\n\nIn some ways being very new has given me a great creative armor, I am not afraid to lose and therefore do not feel bad or something if the ref is a better starting point than my chain or if I am doing very little.\n\nI am fascinated in your perspective as someone who is a pros pro but in between where I am and where Ruairi is.\n\nI\u2019ll land the plane here\u2026it seems like the fact that this song was \u201cabove your pay grade\u201d sort of played into the fact that you were maybe seeking Ruairi\u2019s approval to use that limited ref?\n\nDo you think you would have approached using the ref any differently if you knew it was just some kid in a bedroom, or would you have still trusted that it was still the move to use it?\n\nI ask myself this stuff a lot, since I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m always doing exactly what is right for the song, but of course many factors play into our decision making (insecurity, relationships, fear of losing a project, etc)\n\nSorry for the rant, but your story was very inspiring!

Hoping he hasn't trademarked this one so the Discord doesn't get shut down.\n\n\n\n\"Remember the early Elton John records? Remember how his piano shimmered? At mediasound we loved that sound so a lot of us were always playing around with getting different versions of it. No lacquered hammers, no Dolby A off, just a combination of compression and EQ.\n\n\nI only recorded Luther's voice, may he rest in peace, on that song along with \"searching\" and then mixed both. Luther was on a whole other level of singers. He walked into that session and listened to the song in the control room once, then he walked out into the studio with the lyric sheet in his hand. What you hear on\"Glow of Love\" and \"searching\" is his first fun down reading the lyrics from a yellow pad. No punches.\n\n\nThe piano sound you\u2019re referring to is probably the same one that I did for Vandross on the \u201cNever too much\u201d song.\n\n\nOk, this is how you do it.\n\n1. First insert an LA3A or LA2A (depending on the version of sound you\u2019re going after) across the stereo piano tracks. The LA2A is good if the song is slow and the chords are quarter notes. The LA3A is good if the chords are faster with a harder attack like in \u201cnever too much\u201d. Bang those meters and \n2. out of the compressor go into a couple of pultecs and push up..way up the 3 or 5 k on the low end and the 8 or 10 k on the high end. Don\u2019t be safe. \n3. Now go to the desk EQ and start clearing out some of the muddiness and EQ up the remaining mids so that it just shimmers like a baby. \n4. When it\u2019s done right, you can hear the harmonics riding up during each sustain.  \n5. I remember hearing that song on the radio and man that piano was making me feel good all over. Sounds pretty simple when you know how to do it right?\u201d",

Thanks for sharing.\n\nAnother thing I think about a lot, and I believe posted about it before, was an old Bill Evans documentary where he touched on how to learn to improvise/etc...and his main principle was to essentially \"play at your level\", and accept that's where you are. So instead of playing a bunch of fast notes...play only a few very slowly and intentionally...his theory was that it will sound and feel the most authentic that way.\n\nIn a mastering context, I think about just taking the song was far as I can at my current moment...like I may note be a Ruairi or Dale or Rollmottle but I can still do things that I think sound good and add to the record. It may not be as far as I can go in a year, or 10 but it still can read very musical and cared-for! But it takes a lot of...shall we say self-reflection to accept that I'm not where I can be yet and live with it you know? Instead of trying to force something on a record that doesn't need it",

For analog you can either add your external effect to the clip (which annoyingly stops from being able to hear a reference track). How I capture usually though is to put the clip on a feed track (which is a reference track) send that to the delivery track, and record it in. This way you don't have to render in real time when you bounce or if a small edit, say a different fade or whatever, is needed.",

    "content": "In modern record making clipping and limiting on the buss is a huge part of the overall sound and feel of a record. Kendrick for example never heard his productions, mixes or masters without it. Clipping has an energy in the kicks and snares that was built a certain way, limiting has rounding and smoothing characteristics and often \"holds\" the track in a particular way. You can't just bypass one , or the other or both without huge changes in groove, balance, tone and feel. (Swapping limiters for something *safer* can be equally damaging) \n\nWhat does clipping actually do? It creates square waves at the extreme (for the duration of the clipping)\n\nWhat is a square wave? It is a fundamental with a bunch of odd harmonics trailing off in level\n\nWhat happens when you low pass the square wave at the converter reconstruction filter, lathe low pass etc? It is no longer a square wave\n\nDoes cutting this no longer square wave to a disc for brief periods present challenges and cause extra momentary distortion? Yes\n\nIs that trade off worth while? I believe so and have itterated on this belief across hundreds and hundreds of projects cut and pressed to vinyl and then compared carefully with the original digital files",

There\u2019s a whole school of the online mastering discourse that holds this belief and it strikes me as disconnected from the mainstream. It presupposes that loudness comes at significant cost to the material in some way \u2014 which way? Emotional? technical? artistic?  Or that all material should be dynamic\u2026which is, of course, not true. \n\nAs Noah was getting at, some of my most vivid memories of live music both as a performer and as an audience member exist BECAUSE they were loud as fuck. Loud is in our DNA. There\u2019s a visceral, tactile and emotional response to loud. Even if we\u2019re talking about a \u201cquiet\u201d or more dynamic record, people will turn it up so they can feel it.\n\nGood loud is within everybody\u2019s grasp in 2025 and I love being able to make loud records louder, with minimal, if any, trade off. If I can deliver an appropriately loud master given the material with little compromise, I will. That\u2019s exciting to me and not a bummer. It's what the vast majority of my clients are looking for. Of course if the record doesn\u2019t call for loud, we don\u2019t make it loud. But, I also don\u2019t think excessive loudness is what\u2019s making or breaking records.",

    "content": "@masteredbyjack Your golden rule is still true for me - ( is what I\u2019m doing making the record feel better to me or not? Is it becoming more of what it wants to be?) - is what I strive for. Generally, I am working on stuff with organic tracks, and my moves tend to make the record feel better, make it more of what it wants to be. This song was a bit less organic, but still based in that world - so YES ! I was absolutely seeking outside approval to make me feel better about using the limited ref. I needed a consult haha. Was def freaked out about loosing gig , hence hitting the legend Ruairi.\n\n\"Do you think you would have approached using the ref any differently if you knew it was just some kid in a bedroom, or would you have still trusted that it was still the move to use it?\" - Man, this is such a good question. I have always fantasized about how cool it would be to sit down to work every day and have everything completely wiped so IDK what came from who - like have someone name everything \"A\" \"B\" and just work and then have them \"decode\" it to be the right artists that get their files, but I have no idea whos is whos while working. Obviously this is not realistic but certainly would be a cool experiment. Onto your question - probably so TBH. I might have had less reverence for his processing somewhere in my mind - but I would like to think that I would still have had the discernment to know that the mix was MONEY and that was the goal. I might have fussed with screenshots if the email chain was not stacked with heavy team members, ha, and it was only me and some dude on the thread.\n\nI hope some of this was helpful - learning and growing every day here - I love being wrong or misinformed - means growth. Thanks for the kind words, happy to chat more about this all anytime -  \"The mindset of mastering\".",

You can approach it from a technical mindset and try to hit those targets, but sometimes doing that gets you further from the spirit of what the song is asking to be, if that makes sense.",

Consider how high your output ceiling should be based on the type of arrangement, etc. True Peak could play a role in this depending on the type of record\n\n4. If there are alts, make sure they are aligned and exactly the same length as the main mix (again easy to check length in RX)\n\n5.

You have discussed why this is good for the clients experience, but I have noticed how my subconscious attitude for the project changes the few times people have insisted paying in front of the project. \n\nUsually I have a huge motivation on moving a project along super quick and making sure to have a fast turnaround - the faster I respond and make them happy about their music = payday, both in positive feedback and \ud83d\udcb5. But there is really no pressure since I have only received files, they haven\u2019t payed me anything. If the client has payed, I either find myself slacking bc it\u2019s already payed OR stressing out big time bc they have payed and I feel a huge pressure on not f*cking up the project and the smooth creative process goes out the window. My brain works better with a carrot then a stick.\n\nThat\u2019s why I have found I do my best and fastest work when invoicing after masters are approved.

When working hybrid, I try to keep the same settings for a whole album and do eq, de-essing and level automation pre analog if needed (on individual tracks). On some albums, for me, there is no way around tweaking analog settings per track, but I try to avoid it. When printing the album I use the print-time to casually listen to the album from start to finish to catch stuff I would like to adjust (one track lacks impact ect.). Final limiter is always post analog print and I do not print hot. This makes revisions a breeze 97% of the time, unless there is a new mix of course. Also easy to back of a limiter without reprinting if the client wants more dynamics or I want a more dynamic vinyl pre-master. Hope that made sense.",

I *agree* with your premise\u2026\n\nAs you touched on with data, there\u2019s a reason iOS 14 changed the Facebook ad marketplace and why Meta continues to more or less neglect the end user experience of its platform\u2014because the money now is in having a wide array of data & developing the best ML+AI processes, meaning the big three of Apple, Meta, and Google (Amazon too now I guess\u2026 make it four) only care if they can quantify you when you use their services, hence the animosity for tik tok when it emerged as a new player with a kickass algorithm. So with that in mind, it totally makes sense that music developments such as these (the \u201cfoisted-upon-us-by-the-overlords\u201d kind) should be treated with skepticism, and from what I can see there\u2019s more to atmos than just a flash in the pan, IMO. It\u2019s just not a flash in OUR pan, as we\u2019ve all kind of intimated. \n\nTo thread this very, very tight needle back to atmos, and somehow mastering too, the development of atmos almost always seemed logical if it were done with regards to cinema and gaming\u2014where locating a sound is what mattered most. Alongside atmos, we\u2019ve seen a rise of virtual spaces and platforms post pandemic that coincides with a digital gaming boom\u2014the most convincing case I\u2019ve seen for why we\u2019re even bothering with Atmos is a entirely complete VR/AR experience, which would give entertainment companies wild new ways to expand their horizons and possibly revenues, but like @Nomograph Mastering points out, subsidies are slipping and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s because companies are seeing what we all knew.  \n\nBecause as we\u2019re all saying, not many an artist really give a shit about making atmos or making feel like you\u2019re in the room\u2014that\u2019s a 5 AM stoner thought most musicians have and forget.

    "content": "I'm no Ruairi, but I think about this a lot too, interested in your perspective. The only thing I've ever been able to come up with is \"I like it\". Of course I do my best to take the vision of the project into consideration, where it is and the potential it has to go further...but it truly and always comes down to just asking myself \"am I connecting emotionally, and do I like the music better as a listener than before\".\n\nOn some level, we can only be what we are, if that makes sense. I can't master as well as I will be able to in a year, 5 years, 10 years. But I just do the best I can, when I feel connected to the record, it's done.\n\nHave had quite a bit of stuff come recently, had to get it out quick. I also specifically practice doing very short masters (not for a client, just practice)...I find this lets me know where I am. Almost always just keeping on tweaking hurts the music, our objectivity, etc. Some of my favorite ones I've done were done in 10 minutes. And not because I rushed, because I just trusted my intuition. And I hope this doesn't come off as arrogant/etc but I deeply believe in my taste and what I like. I never question it. Luckily, people seem to agree with me so far. But unless you have that trust in yourself and are willing to put it on the line, not sure how anyone could really do high, high level work like Ruairi is (feel free to push back on this).\n\nAnd sometimes, a \"bold move\" is to barely do anything. That takes a lot of trust and belief too.\n\n My issues almost always lie in me not being able to quite get it where I want to go. That's hard. But never about where it should go, if that makes sense. Sometimes I may be wrong, or people disagree creatively, which is great! That's information we can use to bring their vision to life more accurately.\n\nOne of my favorite coach speak/quote things from my football days was \"you don't rise to the occasion, you default to your level of training\". I find it's true. \n\nThoughts on how you approach that?",

I was more hybrid earlier on during my conversion period and now mostly all in due to my workflow and client time demands.\n\nI definitely feel like i\u2019m chasing Refs with the same plugins used by mixers and producers sometimes and don\u2019t feel creative but that\u2019s the game lately. I really feel this is the main problem. I\u2019m not really happy when i\u2019m pushed in that direction.\nWith almost everyone having the same plugins it\u2019s very apparent that most masters in a shootout sound the same now. No surprises there.\n\nIs Analog Better?\n\nI recently bought a Terry Audio CEQ to try and change my sound and it definitely works. It has an amazing sound and color that cannot be found in most plugins. That being said it doesn\u2019t work for me all the time.\nMany of the projects i work on are so loud and pushed anything run through analog gear loses the \u201cglue\u201d that is in the digital mix.\nI also just got a Sontec MES-432D9D from Make Believe Studios.\nIt actually sounds like the real thing to me. It has a much different vibe when using it. I find myself using different frequencies from other EQs.\nIs That Better? I\u2019m not sure yet but getting good results when i use both of these tools.\n\nI think the most important part of my setup is that I\u2019m very familiar with my plugins and know when to use different ones when necessary (its also so easier to try another one if you\u2019re not sure obviously)\nI\u2019m constantly trying to stay fresh and not mail it in.\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s an actual answer for this but i hope i answered some of your question or at least validated our situation.\n\nChris\"*",

Also I'm sure you deliver things well (believe me, that's NOT the case a lot of the time).

If I mixed I'd do the same probably. \n\nBut also often enough the artist doesn't even know there is an ALT deliverable given to me and I seriously think they don't even want or need it in some (maybe a lot) of cases (of course some do). Just something I need to communicate up front about in the future whenever I decide to make a move. I had just been including them for ease of the process and I needed all the reps to know to do it right...but now that I got the ALT flow covered, know the QC and issues that can pop up...the time and care I spend just isn't reasonable with the amount of work I have right now.\n\nWhich like @peterlabberton said, could just evaporate.

I think you kind of answered your own questions. $10 is crazy low and not sustainable for anyone, I'm not sure what that other engineer could actually be doing besides blasting tracks through Ozone. Since you are already cold emailing, I think your time could be better sent searching out artists who are in need of an ME and get your full rate there. If you took the $10/gigs, they would eventually be dropped anyways as more full rate gigs started coming in. If it were me, I would rather work the word of mouth game through the artists you are DMing and hopefully more gigs stream in that way via other artists, producers, or mixers. Put in the work now creating meaningful relationships and connections that can exponentially grow instead of the label path which seems like a dead end. I've been cold DMing artists with a freebie first song, I just started this month and it's a big numbers game, so I can't say for certain how it will go. But, because of the freebie I gave them, I am now talking with these different artists about mastering an album, an EP, and several singles at full rate. This is rhetorical, but how many cheap label songs would you need to master in order to get the same amount of money? So in short, if it were me, I would spend my time elsewhere creating more meaningful relationships with much more room to grow.",

Or for e.g. a drum bus w/ heavy processing they'll ask if I'm good to work w a stereo stem instead of the multis. But even that's a fairly rare exception. Mostly they've done what they like, they send it how they want to send it, and they want me to mix it.\n\nThere's one producer I work for who regularly wants more feedback. I find it hard to give. Because I wasn't there in the room, I don't know the limitations of the session. It's not helpful to try and impose my harmonic vocabulary or arrangement preferences on someone else's, and the sessions are never unmixable even when I don't think they come from an ideal starting point. And on a fundamental level I really don't like telling other people what to do or how to feel.",

I just tackle the notes -- it's rare I would ever say it wasn't a great experience. I want to master as many records as I can. At the very most I would let them come back again, say it's not the right fit and suggest someone I know to be a good fit (I've done this before). But always with the art and their vision first, if I truly don't understand it.\n\nThat said -- I did get really close to walking on a recent project, we were way down a rabbit hole, I think I legitimately did 15 masters. And we were caught up on dither, comparing to pink noise, etc. It was wild. We got it across the line - but I went way out of what would be constituted by us as what the \"mastering role\" should say, because the music was great and I thought the artist could understand my perspective. And I think it actually hit, to refocus on the art and feeling. \n\nIt's a fine line. Sometimes I get the impression that I do step out of what is supposed to be said by mastering engineers -- but people seem to connect with that on my side. \n\nAlso if things are going that way I will just stream it to them -- often they are looking for control or are having a hard time making decisions -- something I see in this new crop of record makers who only have ever worked in a DAW. Hard to know without actually knowing the humans\n\nThen again, many many times I get a note and it's great and insightful and I love it",

It's not my job to educate clients, and it's definitely not my job to tell them how to feel. It is my job to be an affirming creative collaborator and keep my portion of the relay race that is record-making on track. I've found the more I am open to the weird stuff the more I find cool ways to make things sound better. If I really don't understand something a 5min phone call with the artist or producer solves that problem. If things end up not to my taste, fine. If things truly seem to be going off the rails (like the sudden barrage of notes @thegreatcarsoni encountered) I'll often ask for more info: \"hey, I see you've got lots of new notes, I'd love to chat and make sure I'm nailing things for you on my end.\" More often then not that'll result in a pleasent and productive discussion. Sometimes I end up doing the notes, sometimes the concerned party ends up nixing most or all of the new notes. My whole ethos as a mixer (and occasional producer or ME) is to let the artists and producers into my world and process. No secrets, lots of sharing what I'm doing and why when appropriate. People are not hiring me to mix, they're hiring me to be a creative team member. Being open to \"crazy\" notes and ideas is part of that sometimes.",

But the client sent it to them and did all the communication so i have no idea what the process was like. Also again, many many years ago so could have been an isolated incedent. I'd rather pay a mid level guy in my town that i can easily communicate with than do an online thing like that though.  I think when we did it, we never even got to find out the name of the engineer that did it. EDIT: As Cian said, sterling is also just uploading through an online portal and dealing with assistants, but, at least you know who is mastering it. They also generally only include one revision in the per song mastering rate at sterling, so its similar that way. If you dont have a label budget, it can be limiting if its not quite right the first time back, way less flexible than going with someone who might be able to acommodate a bit more back and forth when needed.",

Generally I got his concept and certainly understand when he talked about becoming so good at sound design he felt he could effectively mimic any master. It all made sense to me , my surprise is particular to the plug in. I don\u2019t know if anyone else has here experience of it, but after all the fanfare when it was released I\u2019ve found the J unusable but Clearly he didn\u2019t. So I was surprised by the choice specifically. Also I suppose, knowing that Ali mixes hybrid and sums his groups through analogue ssl boards as part of his workflow, it seems ironic to me to think after all that it gets put straight into an emulation of one channel  of said board. \n\nI personally like the bpm thing as I do 60;000 /bpm/measure  to dial in a quick ballpark release time (in ozone dynamics) then tweak by feel at  volume . It lets me get to the pulse I want quickly ime , I\u2019m going to have  a good read of the link shared above on the L2  over a coffee now, thanks for sharing  @Adam Thein",

There's a lot of equipment, technology, etc, etc, and since the history of manufacturing musical equipment, recording equipment advancements, etc, dudes are the ones who felt like they could get into that and freely go for it.\n\nThe truth is a lot of what we do is artistic, musical, mental/psychological, dealing with people, service, etc. I think women are getting their feet in the door now in the actual industry more than ever before with a lot of support thankfully.\n\nMaybe the asshats on gearspace or forums are still not leaving an environment where women feel comfortable, maybe there are people in smaller cities who are making it difficult, I don't know.\n\nI teach at a trade school for audio engineering (teaching post production, voice over recording, SFX, commercial shit) and we have more girls now than ever before and it's amazing. They kick ass, always have, and they will be more and more apparent in our industry before too long.",

I have been on both dies of the mastering thing, and I remember  getting masters back sometimes and thinking \"man they really phoned that one in, sounds just like my mix\" - now this opens up a whole nother convo about what mastering is or should be  - and its different project to project - but safe to say that  I was working with idiots back then, and I am willing to admit this mindset might be old school and not helpful to me anymore.\n\nI have played that mixer role before for some time, so maybe some left over trauma from that, but when I would send a song to get mastered - I wanted the ME to BEAT my mix. Not equal it or approve it, BEAT the shit out of it haha. So perhaps that causes me some mindset of \"I will do what they did but better\"  - and on a technical level I find that work is easier done from the non limited mix, personally.",

It's obvious and can eat transients. When at 0 dB TP, it's usually triggering much more randomly, making the ISP control much less obvious. \n\nIf the music is slammed and the second limiter is too aggressive at 0 dB TP, that's when I push up towards +1 dB TP. TDR Limiter 6 is good for this as the ceiling goes positively. It's just not so good for actual limiting!",

In my experience, it's driven by deep insecurity and the best I can do is hear their concerns, remind them all the great things in their song and indulge the notes without breaking the whole thing or heading down rabbit holes that aren't worth anybody's time. It's often a balancing act \"Well, I can't really do on my end that but I can try XYZ to see if that hits what you're feeling\" -- even if I know a thing is technically possible. Sometimes that means a song goes to V7 that was done on V1. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think these folks just want to know they are being heard and I'm not certain there's anything you or I could do better that would solve this other than accounting for more time for projects with stakeholders prone to this (aside from raising their rates or dropping them as clients of course).",

Oversampling that high has this smoothing effect like when you crank the noise reduction on a photo that isn\u2019t coming from the LPF or the decreased distortion. I\u2019m a Dunning Krueger case when it comes to DSP math, but from the surface amount that I\u2019ve drilled into it, it seems that there\u2019s at least a handful of different ways of adding samples to a signal and none of them are completely free of cost to the signal. It\u2019s possible that maxing that process to the ceiling incurs more of that cost.",

I have learned the more songs often the \"longer\" it takes to make them all play nice with each other especially in 2025 where I might get a record that is from the label with 3 mixers, 13 songs over 3 years of single release then ep, then remixed, then all put together to be \"the album\". I  honestly can never copy and paste settings either 99% of the time from song to song which I think some clients assume, well you dial one in so the rest should be faster. Sometimes the record is super consistent and it is \"faster\" in theory, but due dillgence is still needed on every song start finish, then if you get the track list or sequence and its a little complicated or they got high energy next to ballads next to high energy etc. You have to manage how that flows as well. SO I find singles are \"easy\" ...EP are little harder..... LP to get out the door, with each song reaching its potential while feeling cohesive often takes more \"time\". So no discounts. I will sometimes discount the total budget if the people are good, music is good and the budget is not my normal rate.

BUT i ran numbers of time vs money etc about 9 years ago.. and the cost of running alts and the benefit of a flat rate vs explaining to clients cost, and nickel and dime or they come back later and then i had to charge etc. Its way easier for me to run it all right awawy and just call it done. You can make plentyyyyy of money by doing this method and you remove friction and the potential fear in their mind that theres always an upcharge. For me this has played out massively over 14 years of client loyalty and peace of mind. Its a time suck  .. i usuall do invoices during this time... ive done assistance etc.. over they years but then its me paying the assistant to run alts which  is not a high level skill and managing them on some level. Long term you can for sure make a killing just doing it yourself and also the client seems to really enjoy knowing its a turn key process. The  main thing for ths is making sure your charging a high enough rate to start with which isnt really \"hard\" .... its just a matter of presenting the value and sticking to your rate. Customer service is worth a LOT and especially with referrals. Ill get gigs just because of the above method. Time yourslef how long it takes to do the alts, work the numbers and youll find if your charging a \"pro\" rate.. its not a  problem. Now of course if you dont want to do it.. thats a different conversation and fine, get an assistant. ALSO RX batch and some other programs people mention can make it extremely fast with a few clicks of the button.",

    "content": "@Stefan Hi Stephen, this is a great question! \nThere are two issues at play here: One the more obvious, sending the signal to multiple A/D\u2019s, and then, maybe a little less obvious: the issue of how your system is being clocked, and whether the A/D you\u2019re auditioning is exerting maximum performance based on these conditions. Personally, to feed multiple converters, I use a Maselec MTC 1x console. This offers two identical outputs. So the analog signal part of that is solved right there. There are other ways to address this problem like outboard switchers. \n\nBut here\u2019s the real problem, clocking. *Generally*, and when i say generally probably in almost 100 percent of cases, the A/D converter sounds its best when it is the master clock of your system. Of course there are *certain* converters that *may* benefit from external clocking, but I\u2019m not jumping into that can of worms. You can read ENDLESS arguments on Gearspace about this. \n\nI\u2019ll say up front that I think clock sounds best just getting transferred straight through the AES audio feed to your interface, vs using a BNC output to your system, but again, I could get pushback there, that\u2019s my opinion. \n\nSo- let\u2019s get to it, you have two A/D\u2019s running AES feeds into your interface. Now, on your interface itself- you need to choose what AES feed your choosing to Sync to- so you\u2019re going to choose one aes feed, or the other. This doesn\u2019t *preclude you* from solo\u2019ing each feed in your DAW. But the main thing here is that when you audition one converter, you need to also go to your control panel of your interface and select that AES feed to sync if you really want to hear the correct sound. \n\nIn sum, I would do it this way and record a 30-45 pass of each. Then audition them that way (i use comp lanes on the same track to achieve this).\n\nAnother possible way to do this is having an outboard aes switcher like a z sys and switching the converters to the same aes output. Hope this helps!",

    "content": "Hey guys- so I\u2019m asking this question I guess in a mixing context but I know it\u2019s a common function of mastering so I thought I\u2019d post here. \n\nI always have an instance of ozone maximizer at the end of my chain that I mix into. I\u2019m generally happy with the results/loudness I get and comfortable with the parameters, except I never really mess with the \u201ccharacter\u201d which I suppose is the speed/release of the limiting? \n\nOn a recent mix I slowed it down more than I ever would, which really just means making it slower at all from the defaul setting, I usually stick very close to it, and I really like how it made the pocket of my mix feel. But I guess, I have always understood people to use very fast release compression on masterbusses.. \n\ndo you all find yourselves moving the character/release of the final limiter around pretty widely to get the right feel or are you typically keeping it quite fast?",

    "content": "I think time spent de-essing vocals and treating HF content in vinyl prepped masters overrides worrying about how much limiting there is in my opinion. The amount of limiting and how good/bad the cut is really pertinent on the program material itself.  Not the actual amount of gain reduction you are doing because the cutter will literally just turn everything down anywhere between 8-10dB before the signal hits the amps. Excessive sibilance, on a hyper compressed rock record with insane splashy over compressed cymbals and out of control HF information will result in the dull cuts you get back from most plants where you don\u2019t have access to the cutting engineer.  They do this because they want to create a playback safe record and avoid a very expensive $10k mistake like blowing a cutterhead if their amp breakers aren\u2019t calibrated right.  Instead of spot de-essing problem on one song or spot treating problem songs on a side, they will opt for broad stroke moves (HF limiting, EQ, global de-essing) and that can be a bit of death sentence to the quality of the cut and put everyone off vinyl as a format.  Which I think is an incredible format with well crafted engineering.  Also I strongly believe that every record doesn\u2019t belong on vinyl\u2026but that\u2019s another convo.",

    "content": "Ugh that's so frustrating and I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. It's annoying when clients really try to take advantage of the whole \"unlimited revisions\" thing.\nI've dealt with a couple projects like this in the past which led me to communicating with the client at the time of first round delivery that after three free revisions I will charge $25 per revision. This way you still have some opportunities to make adjustments but if they need more than three revisions, more often than not it was a problem with the mix and not the master.\n\nI feel like when you send this next round of files back you should let them know that this is the last one you can provide without extra compensation for your extra work and time.",

    "content": "My Reaper workflow is to use the DDP marker formatting for every format's renders. (DDP, .wav, .mp3, even vinyl, etc...) \n\nLet's say you have your track markers formatted as : **#TITLE=songtitle|PERFORMER=artist|ISRC=666** etc., aside of the \"!\" marker at the beginning for the 2sec gap and the last \"@\" marker for the album metadata.\nYour session is now ready for a DDP export.\nThen, if you want to render .mp3 and/or .wav you have to use the wildcard : **$marker(#TITLE)[|]** in the file name entry, aside to other wildcards you'll need for folder structures etc. Also, the options :  \"Bounds : All project markers\" and \"do not render files that are likely silent\" are needed and will prevent rendering the empty first 2 sec marker.\nTo automatically include metadata in the files, you can use the same wildcards such as : **$marker(#TITLE)[|]** for Title,** $marker(PERFORMER)[|]** for Artist, **$marker(ISRC)[|]** for ISRC, etc etc...\n\nWith this method, you can, with one single workflow, render : DDPs, digital formats, and even vinyl, using additional regions. Once you have everything ready in render presets, it's super easy.\nI recommend using the \"WyattRice DDP editor\" to easily edit the markers.\nI've also made a script to automatically generate a .html \"PQ sheet\" file with timings, titles, ISRCs, etc, (both CD and Vinyl)\n\nI hope it can help, English is not my native language, so feel free to ask for clarifications if needed.",

Some records that start with an intro track of sfx or quiet musical bits end up being screaming loud if played from the album mode with soundcheck enabled.",

For example I found it interesting Ruairi says he knows how loud a record is because he knows his room so well and doesn\u2019t need to look at the meters.

    "content": "We did discuss a bit earlier but I\u2019m not sure I understand your question \u2014 I think I read it as you looking into the trade off between turning down a more limited/compressed track (i.e to a dBFS level of like -.5 compared to where others are at) vs leaving the peak level and some more dynamics (which can also make a song sound quieter but in a different way)? \n\nIMO it\u2019s just a gut feeling/listening game. Both approaches work but have different implications that have to be decided based on artistic intent.\n\nBut specifically for albums (and all mastering generally) working off intuition always works so much better for me. This also means you have to sort of practice outside of \u201cgame time\u201d so the tools flow when in the moment. Able to work quicker so you keep the entire project in mind. Mastering is a game of trade offs both in songs themselves and between them.\n\nAlso IMO \u201ccohesion\u201d is totally overrated in mastering albums. I never care (or even know, honestly) as a listener if song 8 sounds cohesive with song 1. I just care that the arc of the album moves me",

Cohension matters, it's just that I find I care less about it than the feeling of the album if that makes sense. @Nomograph Mastering is way more experienced and knowledgeable than me on this.\n\nI'd also push back against your assumption that every song has to have the same output ceiling. This may be \"normal\" but sometimes it's just not the move. Just did an album where one song wanted to be more compressed/limited. So we did that but just literally turned down the gain on the output so it fit better with another quieter (more dynamic, not output level) track before it to match the \"loudness\" of the two more closely.\n\nHard to give any other insight because so much of it is dependent on the actual songs you have, what the artist's vision is, how to serve that, etc. Dynamics/energy/loudness plays a big part in that!",

    "content": "What @hyanrarvey and others said...but usually this is used to get a bounce with the compression to make sure it is releasing in time with the groove. In gridded stuff like hip-hop you can actually be really mathematic with it, but generally you don't need to it's about the feel. Of course every compressor is different even with the same \"settings\"...you can set the attack to let enough transient in and the release to basically make the compressor return to \"zero\" in time with the movement of the groove. But the release shape, etc will definitely play a role in this too\n\nAt least this is how I'm usually using it (though very rarely compressing at all, and when I do I'm using the Weiss DS1-Mk3 plug which has complicated release characteristics). Feel free to correct me if I'm off the mark on this! It is about feel and making the record pump in a pleasing way which can add energy. But of course it's helpful to be very specific about what part of the groove you're actually wanting to bring out (or back) so to me it's hugely about your gut reaction to how the groove moves you",

I've never been happy with this and wonder whether this plugin may help optimise for vinyl, the other variable is that most of these records get manufactured via a broker and usually end up being cut at GZ Media in Czechia, I've had good and fairly frequently bad experiences with them so am keen to improve this side of my offering.  If anyone is using Simulathe I would love to get your feedback on it.  I know @hebakadry and @Bonati12461 mentioned it but I think you were using it in conjunction with your actual lathes.",

It\u2019s got a vibe of  a david lynch movie about a singer who is the love child of dusty Springfield and Elvis who grew up with Kate bush on tour with Tom waits and roger waters . Anyhoo I digress ! If I may ask as much as poss without asking you to divulge anything compromising about the process : I am fascinated by a few things and wonder what your approach was . In many parts this work feels almost like a  poetry with orchestration and I think has extended parts with little or quite subtle drum parts . I wonder with something like this how do you judge how hard (or not ) to push the overall level (both individual tracks and all together ) as for me I think I tend to judge off what the drums / bass dictates w/regard to level . In this case where drums and bass aren\u2019t really dominating , I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be as confident in knowing what is the right level . After all there are periods of soft vocal and very gentle lush strings \u2026..these sorts of passages I might get a bit unsure In . I also wondered did you stay in the box for this one ? \u2026.and was this a project for mostly eq more than comp/limiting ? The sound of the record is v expensive and classic imo , do you treat a record like this completely differently with regards to what processes you might use on a different genre (again ITB vs analogue chains ) . Also , I wondered how long did you have to master this ? I\u2019m v interested by engineers abilities not just to perform but to perform to deadlines . It seems this record could go badly wrong if the right choices aren\u2019t made (where a clipped crushed mix could be more forgiving) I wonder how much time you get to review the moves you make on a project like this and if/when you don\u2019t have much time \u2026.do you ever play it safe ?/ make less bold moves in the absence of time to review them ?",

I\u2019ve taken it about as far as I can with RX but there\u2019s massive sections where the drums are edited so poorly that beyond normal momentary bad cross fade pop noises, the transients are audibly blurred and doing the whoosh thing. do you guys and gals ever just straight up tell a client that it\u2019s not ready or do you do the best you can with the source material? I don\u2019t think he will be able to zoom in enough with critical ears to hear/fix this stuff, but I don\u2019t want to go back to the artist and tell them that I need to charge more to basically crack open the multitrack/do somebody else\u2019s dirty work.",

A mastering engineer I've never worked with before just delivered separate ones (-9 lufs streaming and -5 lufs digital) which I've never seen before and doesn't fill me with the largest amount of confidence - the feeling of the record changes a bit when it's more / less slammed and I feel a bit weird about the idea of two different feeling versions of one record existing in the world. Is there a technical advantage to the separate digital masters approach?",

It does do a very cool job, but I just wonder if the Fearn is maybe a little more like \"clear\" in the lows or something? We've talked about the rounding of the lows, I know that's indicative of the tubes on some level but I've been mulling maybe going to the Fearn since usually what the Manley does best to me (biggers boosts/cuts transparently) I feel is just too much for a lot of the stuff I'm doing and a lot of mastering these days.\n\nAlso for most modern pop stuff I'm in the box, this wouldn't be for that. But I do actually use the MP a fair amount with good result in the capacity of it being a \"tube box\" sorta thing\n\n@Nomograph Mastering obv you have some experience and I know @Rollmottle moved on I think from it?

To make it even worse, if the song you are listening to was uploaded at 48, you\u2019re getting two rounds of conversion.

    "content": "My life circumstances have changed, so my reaction to that mess was basically to stop mixing and go fulltime on this business idea I've been sitting on for a while. Was getting fed up of mixing records I didn't like so my main thing now is to only mix records I like and probably going forward only mix records for people going on my label. Means I can be really selective which works better for me because I've been through so many shit situations in the last 2 years. (This story is one of many). Through everything, I've learned that I care far too much about pleasing the artist and I jumped through way too many hoops to do so. In future, I will give less of a shit. Which sounds like a terrible idea, but really I'm just trying to dial back my obsessive behaviour. In terms of technicals, I learned nothing in the situation, artist could hear something that fucked everything up for them, I could hear nothing, none of my peers could hear what the artist was talking about either. Was only the mastering chain, as the mix was fine. I turned off every plugin individually to get at the issue and it remained. I think it was a combination of things, but I've never had anyone pinpoint the issue before and admittedly I mostly use the same combination of plugins for my mastering jobs (for functionality reasons, not because this specific combination of plugins make the records 'sound' better).",

At @Nomograph Mastering level I think there are a whole other set of things that come into play of course, I\u2019m even starting to see it myself as relates to running as a full time mastering only shop\n\nSomeone like a @Jeremy Daniels (though he is a mixer wholly)\u2026a person who really has a deep feeling of records I think would and could crush both sides if he wanted.\n\nAlso I see @Jonathan Jetter doing amazing work in both mixing and mastering, it\u2019s possible!",

Knowing when to respect magic and where it's coming from is the first skill we should be teaching any technical person.\n\nIt's all art and taste which takes years to develop and at this point, it's easy for me to hear when someone tried to make an \"engineer's\" mix rather than elevate what was cool about the demo. I'm still guilty of making these myself but that's what the delete button is for. I don't know where exactly the cutoff point is switching between the creative/artist brain and the professional engineer mentality (maybe once problem-solving or writing emails). \n\nBut the longer I do this the more it becomes clear to me that when I'm sitting in front of the music itself, feeling what's coming at me and not thinking about my moves is the gig. I don't think that should change at any point. Applies just as much in mastering as it does during the production stage IMO. There's just a different set of constraints at every level that present new opportunities and possibilities.",

I mentioned the places where Im wincing at the mid spikes to the ME and he suggested I go into the mix and address those places on the vocal and send it back. \n\nMy worry is that I\u2019ll carve out some of the energy in those places since I\u2019m not actually hearing those areas as problematic until they\u2019re pushed the extra distance in mastering. The master for reference was returned at around -6.8 LUFS and otherwise feels pretty good there but I\u2019m wondering if:\n\n1) I\u2019m hearing my mix fall apart as it\u2019s being pushed harder into the limiter and can and should be preempting this with carving more mids next time\n2)This is something the ME\u2019s usually just deal with as a price of playing the loudness game or if the suggestion for me to address it in the mix is reasonable.\n3)I should just find another ME for peace of mind so i can stop thinking about this mix \ud83d\ude05\n-",

They then provide a list of UPC codes and some \u201cinternal coding\u201d which look to be ISRC codes \ud83e\udd14 \n\nI\u2019m fine upsampling from 48/24 (although there\u2019s no obvious benefit to this imo) but I\u2019ve only dealt with ISRC\u2019s in the context of a DDP. Are you able to embed ISRC codes to individual audio files like this? If so, how would I best go about doing this? Or should I just deliver the high res WAVs and advise them to embed the ISRC codes via their distributor?\n\nAppreciate any feedback!",

Got a call... Hey man it feels like the kick isn't sitting right in the mix, the vocals sound a little peaky overall, and it sounds like the song as a whole just isnt as dynamic as the mix. I let him know exactly what i did and he proceeds to talk with the artists and then tell me they will give me a new mix. \nMix two, the vocals weren't loud enough throughout the track and yet again was asked what I did in the master to make this happen and why the vocals sounded compressed.\nWas then told yet again that this was a mix issue.\n\nWe are now on \"Final mix 4\" and i'm hesitant to even send off another master at this point.",

    "content": "Was messing with RX's new Loudness Optimize/Streaming Preview stuff today. So if I'm understanding correctly, it seems like in order to have our masters played as loud as possible through streaming normalization, the quiet sections of the song should be turned up past a certain threshold in order to be included in the integrated loudness reading, with the goal being to decrease the integrated level as much as possible. \n\nNow I had a song with a filtered guitar loop as the intro, and that part was below the loudness threshold shown in the Loudness Optimization module. It was also showing that only 93% of the song was above the threshold and being included in the loudness reading of -9.5 or so. After I ran it, that intro was being compressed pretty obnoxiously, as well as some other down sections of the song, and the integrated went down to -9.7. So I guess I could have gotten 0.2db of extra loudness through normalization, but the upwards compression just did not sound good.\n\nWondering what you all think of it? I guess the moral of the story is to pay attention to the quiet sections of your songs and see if you can make them come in a little hotter, but there's obviously a line there of either gain or compression one is willing to make. Super interesting though and insightful to know all this about streaming! I feel like I can make some moves in mixing to accommodate things like this if necessary.",

All is well until the majority of labels I contact all get mastered by the same engineer who charges \u00a310 a track, which I think is such a low rate and seems like a race to the bottom.\n\nIs it worth it at my stage to take on these lower paying gigs? \n\nMy thoughts are:\n- It could be damaging to the clients I already work with that pay my full rate.\n- These bottom clients will never be full rate if they've had a \u00a310 deal for years\n- It gets more work in for me = my name gets spread out a bit more. But, these labels never seem to credit the mastering engineer.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What would you do?",

Gone full time into mastering at the start of this month (using the money I've saved for gear as rent money essentially buying me time to grow the buisness) so money wise is pretty scary.\n\nDefinitely going to pivot what I'm doing and head down the artist/producer/mixer route, you're completely right.

I'm not disagreeing with any of the above, but I'm struggling a little to reconcile it with my experience as an artist who has sent mixes off for mastering, asked for notes, and genuinely wanted to be told if there was something like \"the kick seems 6db too loud\" so that I reevaluate, see if I missed something, think about why that happened, and maybe send a new version of my mix. It feels strange to me to have this perspective as a client (i.e. this is the service I hope to get and am paying for) and then on the other side of the relationship say something like \"don't provide this information, even though they asked for it, just do the best master you can\". There's a mismatch there that _could_ be interpreted as the ME not providing the service the client wants. Perhaps the contextual difference here is that when I was sending these mixes to mastering, it was not my \"career\", I didn't have a team, or deadlines, or a label involved. Or perhaps I'm just misunderstanding?",

When I (a mixer) get hired to do a mix/master for an indie client, I often feel like I lack some knowledge about the technical side of *delivering* a proper master. Is there a sort of checklist that I could have in terms of making sure the master file I deliver goes through a similar QC process as a pro master would? Things like dithering, sample and bit rate stuff, fades, and then the realm of things I've never thought about like metadata come to mind. Or an answer could be I shouldn't worry too much about all this and just deliver a file at same sample rate/bit depth as it was and hand over the .wav? Just wondering if I can step up my \"mastering\" game in a technical sense (quotations because I will never call myself a real mastering engineer lol)",

On a lot of what I work on that has tons of low end I might get things feeling good with one limiter but then there might be the occasional peak that makes it crunch up so rather than fussing with it (and making it not work as well for 90% of the time) I'll have another limiter bring down those peaks and get things not crunching. I guess I could use volume automation but that seems much more finicky than just spreading the load on 2 limiters",

There is major panning already happening within these tracks\u2026 so I\u2019ve been trialing out imaging tools such as S1 imager, Ozone Imager, T-racks imager, Microshift & Doubler. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s important to be cautious with these plug-ins as they can introduce phasing issues. I\u2019m also finding the stereo sound these plug ins are producing sounds - fake, thin, untasteful and feels as thought is alters the song in negative way. \n\nAt times I thought maybe I\u2019m need more instrumentation within these arrangement to play with panning - but I hear absolutely gorgeous tracks that are simply a vocal and an acoustic guitar that have such a rich deep stereo field (almost as if there were 2 acoustic gtr\u2019s) \n\nI\u2019ve been starting to play with M/S eq and have been having some small wins - but would appreciate and thoughts, views, opinions or direction!\n\nThanks team \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

This mindset makes me really nervous, like if they want it brighter and the snare to snap a little more and stuff, that should be handled in the mix. I don't want to do endless revisions, but if you tell me after 4 rounds of revisions there's additional stuff you want changed, I'd rather just do it. Why do a stem master?

I suspect this may be where the learning opportunity lies...\n\nI think what matters to me is that 1) the piece is presented in the best way possible to maximise its impact or essence 2) the piece is listenable and that impact is not lost in a wide range of environments / contexts (i was tempted to say \"it translates well\" but I think that's a subtly different thing) 3) the client is happy with the result, and feel confident releasing their art, feeling good about it, feeling it's the best version of what it could be.\n\nI think it's point 3 that gives me pause. You can count my paying mastering clients on one hand, so I'm as \"beginner level\" as it gets, but that said, when i talk to those clients, they share with me that they want a mastering engineer to ensure that their music is going to \"sound right on streaming platforms and translate well to lots of systems\". There's a lot of FUD about loudness normalisation, LUFS, etc. I don't think it's a huge leap to feel that we should also be thinking about common playback devices such as airpods, and bluetooth speakers. For clients who aren't seasoned mixers or record makers, I wonder how they would feel if they listened to their mastered record on a bluetooth speaker and heard that whole parts had practically vanished. Of course I'm also sensitive to not wanting to introduce doubt in their minds unnecessarily.",

It is a small town with a fairly large university (with a lot of tech) compared to the city size. Today I was contacted by a student that also works with Masterchannel, \u00aba company that develops AI-technology for music mastering\u00bb. They want to rent my studio to record videos of people using their software. They want to know the price for renting it, but they were also open for a trade where I can freely use their photo/video-content to promote my studio \ud83e\udd13\n\nI do not feel threatened by AI-mastering services in any way as I believe I offer a different service then they do. I also always respond to emails with a positive and helpfull tone, but there are so many ways I could answer this one.\n\nHow would you respond in a civil way, but kind of get the point across? Don\u2019t want to be rude, just kindly decline and give them a few pointers on why I don\u2019t want to be affiliated with an AI-mastering service.",

If you\u2019re in a room where you\u2019re hearing what\u2019s happening clearly, you can work. Now we all have our preferences on that \u2018last 5 percent\u2019 of sonics, which influences your decision, but if I can hear the eq and get a cohesive tight image and strong center, it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m fine. All of that is Much more important. \n\nThese converters are all so fucking good now. I think 15 years ago which one you had was more of a heated discussion. \n\nJust don\u2019t feel the need to go off the reservation on the ones you\u2019ve seen in the top guys racks over the years, and\u2026DONT BUT SOME VINTAGE THING THAT COULD BREAK ON YOU!!!

I\u2019d love to shift more toward mastering, but I still rely on production/mixing gigs to make ends meet.\n\nI know being multifaceted is important, but I worry that offering too much could make people trust my mastering skills less. When I see engineers who produce, mix, and master, I tend to assume they aren\u2019t great at mastering (maybe unfairly).\n\nI\u2019m early in this journey and may be overthinking.

If you heard the music you would have NEVER guessed this twist in the story. \n@hebakadry is correct that highs are a bigger deal. I guess the point is every project has unique characteristics that require the person cutting it to sometimes make decisions that blur technical and artistic ones together.

When they\u2019re in my environment, I find it\u2019s easier to have conversations on the record, and what Im feeling about it and what they feel about it . Even a phone conversation, not even about the track necessarily, but just shooting the shit and them getting to know you, helps a TON with these types of situations when come up. \nHuman connection is everything in the service industry. A lot of people are too busy to talk. And in some cases for legitimate reasons. My clients appreciate that they can reach me, text me etc without dealing with middlemen. When a client feels like they\u2019re sent something off and aren\u2019t getting what they expect out of communication, and THEN getting back something they don\u2019t like.

Sometimes I need to really limit like 5-6dB of gain reduction and that scares me a lot! At the moment I find that clipping a bit more aggressively before the limiter makes for a cleaner more musical result for the majority of the time rather than relying heavily on the limiter. The music feels more connected. So far I find the Pro L2 in All Round mode being the most transparent limiter followed by the balanced mode in ozone maximiser but as always depends on the song.

I want to create those honest feedback relationships, or at least open the dialogue and ask about certain issues, talk with the mixer/artist about what they want, etc, in order to dig in a bit more. But I'm recognizing that this kind of approach also ends up digging holes into my pay-to-time-spent-working-on-a-project ratio. And I do see the point that what people usually actually want from a ME is someone who will take their baby and make sure it's all good and just help them get it out the door. \n\nI feel like I want to make thing more complicated and context-dependent. But many of you are saying that I should mostly treat this like emotional support, rather than technical support, in most circumstances. \n\nIt makes me think of how I've learned to turn off my own technically minded 'problem-solving' approach to life issues when I'm trying to support my wife - who just gets annoyed when I try to brainstorm solutions to her problems, and actually just wants to be emotionally supported. I find it super hard to do this, and I have to consciously hold my tongue and say and do all sorts of things to provide her with what she wants, rather than what I would naturally do.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg",

(Apparently this behavior change a bit across the different algorithms) \n\nAm I missing something ?\nShould I stop paying attention to this graph, and use the \"compact mode\" of the GUI ? \ud83d\ude42",

I hear you and think we are coming at it from two different places but I really admire and respect your perspective . \n\nMy perspective on the OP\u2019s question is informed somewhat by my other engineering work .  The dynamic feels very familiar.\n\nI\u2019m used to a competency-based hierarchy but where work gets critiqued constantly, regardless of who did it or who knows who. We focus on solving the issue in front of us, not protecting reputations. The work stands on its own, and separating critique from personal loyalty keeps things efficient and professional. \n\nIn this regard , I feel that one\u2019s honest impression of someone\u2019s work shouldn\u2019t be taken ad hominem and as a slight \u2026. Because ultimately that part isn\u2019t of any engineering utility . \n\nI love and agree with you about meeting the music and I also value above all things that people are not made to feel scared or risk humiliation for asking a question \u201cin class \u201c . That actually makes me sad  \n\nAgain , Thanks for expanding on your view ruairi.  \n\nI always enjoy a discussion",

Plus, getting into the nitty gritty of the hundreds of limiters/compressors and other plugins can get very overwhelming very quickly. Keeping it at a minimum has also helped keep things flowing more smoothly.",

    "content": "This is a good point.  I definitely remember a time when GS lore was to 'let the mastering engineer finish it'.  I've recently seen it swing so far back the other way where some big producer/mixers slam mastering as a sham sold by fake wizards.  I admit in the past feeling like I should always be doing something, but then there was a great MWTM with Randy Merrill where he did small but extremely tasteful moves that elevated but didn't rebuild the songs.  Very ear opening at the time as there weren't many other videos like that and here's a top guy with no ego only doing what was needed and no more.",

I feel lucky that I've been able to use all the baller things people talk about, demystifies them a bit, helped remove GAS and turned the light back on me, they didn't automatically make magic songs or masters as some would have you believe.  That switch of default from 'must have or run thru this gear' to 'let's listen and see what's going on before doing anything' helps immensely.",

Lately, most of the stem work I do is with international artists who self mix, where the exchange rate makes it very hard to hire outside mixers, if they\u2019re hard to find for the particular genre they oscillate in.  So even if I wanted to recommend a mixer it\u2019s not really in the cards and I gotta step in and help out.  Which I\u2019m super happy to\u2026when it\u2019s right.",
