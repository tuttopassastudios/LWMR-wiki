The dynamics, combined with the *type of low frequency* content of those genres at that time, along with DJ\u2019s who knew what the fuck they were doing, along with sound crews who worked the rave circuit and were continually hired and worked with the same DJ\u2019s, all contributed so much to this magic rave Vinyl era.\nThere\u2019s nothing that touched those deep kickass lows back then, But That was the style! \nSo much has changed. Producers back then got their loudness from pushing analog desks into the red, Simple Mackie desks, stuff like that. But We moved to an all digital world. I remember when the first pioneer digital DJ mixers came out, I\u2019d put a vinyl on and just be like\u2026this is shit! where\u2019s my headroom?!?! the frequency distribution of the music has also changed, DJ\u2019s also got more concerned with jumping up and down and clapping rather than mixing and gain staging. Clubs started putting limiters on the systems \nMost of these kids doing EDM at high levels-really don\u2019t even need ME\u2019s at all! Their mix busses are so super complex. If they took that stuff off, I\u2019d be totally lost. But they like a little analog processing in a lot of cases. Loudness, they *don\u2019t need*\nClipping, limiting, whatever, it\u2019s the modern thing- If i can help I can- and I tell them not to change a thing- just back off the limiter until the exact moment where the track loses the vibe. Then I go.",

    "content": "Hey. There\u2019s nothing wrong with putting EQs and limiters on your master buss as you mix. A little bit of EQ or a lot of limiter is alright.\n\nThe answer here is to mix *into* your limiter. You don\u2019t want to mix the entire song and then slap a limiter on at the end for loudness. As you\u2019ve discovered that will mess up the balances that you\u2019ve spent so much time getting right. You want to ease the final limiting in as you\u2019re building the mix.\n\nI usually start a mix by pulling my limiter down a few dB. Enough to get everything starting to touch the limiter. To get the loudness in the ballpark.\n\nThen I\u2019ll push into it a little more so that I\u2019m starting to get some gain reduction. Certain instruments may begin to get pushed down or distorted in a way I don\u2019t like. Maybe the kick is hitting the limiter too hard, so I bring it\u2019s level down and then lower my limiter some more.\n\nContinue this process of adjusting balances into your limiter as you mix until you\u2019ve got the loudness where you want it. Usually I\u2019m checking in on my limiter a few times throughout the mix to see if I can push it harder without penalty. When I hear it distort in a way that I don\u2019t like I back off.\n\nHope that helps some.",

    "content": "Surely there's something to learn from the history though yes? Cutting is what the profession of mastering used to be and digital is not wholly removed. We can certainly take learnings from our history while embracing modern methods. Cutting good vinyl is also respect for the folks who work on it and the artists who want their music conveyed appropriately across mediums. \n\nI have no problem making stuff massively loud with zero limiting and small amounts of soft clipping, and still retaining tons of transient peaks. I prefer this sound to heavy limiting at the master stage where the program material audibly hits the limiter and the soundstage and sense of headroom collapses. To me, the limiter is optional, but I do understand many use it before they acquire the skills to work without it. \n\nThat said, I also was taught that in genres where its appropriate (Imagine Dragons, Hip hop, EDM, etc.) that those sounds should go in at the production or mixing stage. At the mastering stage I was taught to do no harm, and only to enhance what was present. In my work pushing more than a few dB into a limiter to affect the groove of a piece does not track with my understanding of doing as little to change the sound as possible. But of course, it all depends on the project. My clients who make very mainstream pop/youtube music don't particularly care if I radically editorialize as long as it sounds good and serves the tune. \n\nThere's also something to be said for music which needs to be quiet. Not all music should be loudenated to within an inch of its life. Not all music needs quiet and intimacy. I think of we hold the pursuit of \"the program material's individual requirements to be king\" we cannot then also dismiss vinyl as unimportant or say that one MUST always do things a particular way.",

I'm curious about other's approaches and work flows for mastering albums specifically.\n\nI also have a more targeted question. I am wondering, in a world where most modern records take up all available headroom are relative track balance decisions (i.e. *I want the final chorus of track 3 to be the loudest perceived part of the entire album*) made at the input stage of the final limiter? Choosing less gain reduction via limiting or compression as well as distortion / saturation rather than turning a track down. Seems like a ratchet towards clipping, distortion, and lack of dynamic range and transient detail. Sure that's a whole can of worms but would be interested to discuss it. \ud83e\udd18",

Most of the creative aspects of mixing is dialed in from production stage. When I mix my own stuff, it is mostly fitting everything together and doing rides. \n\nBut I think I also have to do this because I'm still a rookie, with time and experience - I'd probably get better at making more sound decisions early on.

And many people have lots of different takes on this. \n\nBut my advice is to not even worry about the concept of mastering at this point in their musical journey and just make the best music they can, and put as much effort into it as humanly possible to make it sound to the best of their ability. And then slap a limiter on it to get it as loud as they can get it before it starts sounding worse. Make mix changes based on what they don\u2019t like when testing it on different systems. \n\nAnd while it might not sounds like a the weeknd record mastered by sing, it should still be able to be somewhat competitive to other people at the same level. \n\nReps will teach them something new every time. And finding a mentor will also do the same. If they can an attended mastering session with someone who does great work, it could give some great insight about the possibilities and function of what mastering actually does. \n\nThis might be a bit of a hot take, but if a track sounds very far from release ready before mastering, it\u2019s probably not ready to be mastered yet.",

I\u2019m curious as to how you all approach limiting on your masterbus, and how much headroom you\u2019re generally leaving before master processing starts, if any at all.\n\nAlso, is all clipping inherently *bad*, depending on how much you\u2019re clipping?",

    "content": "I'm not doing much limiting on my master buss. As I'm working I might be catching 6 dB of peaks, but by the time things are mixed I'm getting the loudness at the source instruments or instrument group. My master buss might be averaging 3 dB of gain reduction at the end. If I have heavy transients from the drums hitting my limiter I'll limit the drum group so it's not ducking the entire mix when they hit.\n\nI don't use clippers at all. To my ears they reliably make things sound like mush, but other people seem to get good results with them.\n\nWhen it comes time to master, I'll turn down my limiter and pass it to the ME. Confident that my balance isn't dependent on everything being smushed into a limiter.",

    "content": "I'm not sure if that's your mindset at the moment, but when I started, I had this idea that mastering = processing the master bus. So I also thought that mixing had to stop before the master bus.\nMixing should be considered as shaping 100% of the sound, whatever it needs to achieve what you want.\nI think it's better to see mastering as a final quality check plus taking care of files, metadata, etc.",
