Note I didn't say \"most expensive\"\n\n2) Next spend as much time as possible listening with the best listeners you can get access to (other engineers, music fans, kids)\n\n3) Ignore almost everything you read and watch on the internet about the topic of Mastering \n\n4) RIngfence your time developing and understanding techniques away from when you are actually working on music\n\n5) Maximize your availibilty to the music (keep distractions, overheads, gear envy, fear etc to a minimum)\n\n6) Now listen as widely as you can, to every genre - listen for details, listen like a fan, zoom in, zoom out, zoom in again\n\n7) Love everything you touch. You don't have to like it, but you've gotta love it. Love is a quality of attention. Attend to the music with generosity, as you would a child, or grandma, or a precious butterfly",

In a follow up to this, as a wonderful surprise, had my master picked in a shootout against an engineer who is leagues ahead of me.\n\nMy master was 1.6db quieter, and the artist actually liked the space it gave (it is still plenty plenty loud). Just was interesting that this artist had the understanding of really what they wanted, how it mattered to his art, etc.\n\nOther guys master sounded great too, just really hot and dense dense. which I feel 9 times out of 10 will win because explaining the trade offs and benefits of loudness (and having it understood) is very hard, but this felt like an artist really leading with their vision, not concern with the loudness stuff\u2026how he articulated it to me confirmed that.

Not every user has normalization turned on. Thus, the material will be arbitrarily quiet next to other material that isn\u2019t mastered to the target.

More time spent bouncing and QCing, means less time available for more work and even less personal time.\n\nThirdly, I learned pretty quickly that people really love their mixes and the less I do to a track and the more I get out of the way to finish it, the happier everyone is. Having \u201cfun\u201d with gear (to me) was just me putting myself/ego into the equation and truthfully I just needed to get out of the way.\n\nFitter, Happier, More Productive.",

It's resulted in some of my favorite sounding records I've ever been a part of. She respected the mix, but took chances and didn't just hand me back my mix. Out the door they were some of my favorite mixes I've ever done and Heba brought something else to them that I couldn't or wouldn't have thought to. I trust her taste & I asked for her imprint. I think there's a way to do both... you can 100% encourage a mastering engineer to push things further and forward without undercooking a mix... but it definitely requires an alignment of taste and trust.",

    "content": "Been trying to think of a way in to the question about what I did without being completely frustrating or giving a list of moves that don't mean anything outside of the context of being in my chair, hearing what and how I hear.\n\nThis process for this song is like any other...listen for what the song needs and act accordingly. That's the frustrating answer but it's also true. What did you do? \"I mastered it.\" lol\n\nBut I know that's not what you're asking. For a track like this, I'm primarily focused on the vocal and how it's sitting and feeling. The vocal performance is incredibly dynamic and intimate. This one had some ringy stuff through 2.5k and in the upper mid range that I felt was detracting from the \"fireside\" intimacy. The goal was to take off some of the edge without stepping on the presence. That was a combo of RX and EQ. \n\nOn this song, I did an analog pass because I am usually able to manage to get the balance of presence and de-edge I'm looking for very quickly. Since time was of the essence here, that was the move. Couple of moves on Equilibrium digitally before the Gyraf and Porter Grinder in the analog chain. The \"trickiest\" thing I did here was flip the Porter Grinder into M/S to bring the vocal closer into the center (by cutting!) and to push the mellotron and atmospherics to the sides (by boosting). All very subtle stuff.\n\nSo, there were some moves here, but the moves were all in service of the feeling the song was telling me it needed. We talk a lot about monitoring here. When you can connect to the song and walk around inside of it, it's much easier to know what you need to do (or not to do) to bring it to life.",

Having spent a considerable chunk of time recording an album for & with my best friend -- we asked Eric Valentine to master the record and he said yes. Having worked under for him for a few years at this point, it felt like a bit of a reckoning... having him critically listen to something I had really poured my all into. Needless to say, he treated it as he treated everything... with genuine curiosity and actionability. He sized up the mixes in no time, told me the strengths, the weaknesses, even sent me into the other room to re-print versions slightly quieter, fix this pop here, maybe put the guitar solo up here. He gave it his full 12 hours (what felt like 100 hours to me) and the end product leveled up in so many ways. Granted he is not really a 'mastering engineer', but he approached this little project like he approached everything in his music career, with a deep sense of giving a fuck and knowing that there's no real excuse to not fix the obvious issues in front of you. The album sounded fantastic and it really spoiled me for what a mastering experience could be.",

    "content": "As far as the Atmos vs Vinyl debate\u2026vinyl has an amazing organic culture that has spanned decades especially in the electronic and techno scene\u2026unlike Atmos\u2026a multi channel film format shoehorned by a bunch of corporations to sell their shitty proprietary headphones. \u00a0If one more person tries to shill the \u201cstereo is vintage\u201d debate, I will gouge them in the eyes.   Stereo rules\u2026and it\u2019s withstood all the changes this industry has seen because it\u2019s FREE when Alan Blumlien's patent ran out and everyone eventually adopted it\u2026it was not proprietary\u2026and asking the consumer to add one speaker was not a huge ask. \u00a0Whereas now, with Atmos\u2026I dunno\u2026it\u2019s depressing.  It's riddled with problems including their horrible horrible binaural algorithm which will continue to change and possibly improve while the engineers that make the records will have absolutely no say in said changes. \u00a0I think I wouldn't have had a problem with Atmos if they didn't force the binaural format because it takes the craft out of the medium and you end up spending half the time trying to remotely match the stereo version.  People are making money off of it, but it\u2019s just NOT the artist. \u00a0I haven\u2019t met a single artist that was actually excited about Atmos. \u00a0Like truly excited about it.",

    "content": "It has become fashionable to post online about targeting -14LUFS or so, but in my opinion, if you care about sounding approximately as loud as other artists, and until loudness normalization improves and becomes universally implemented, that is mostly well-meaning internet chatter, not good practical advice. My advice is to make one digital master that sounds good, is not overly crushed for loudness, and use it for everything. Let the various streaming sites normalize it as they wish. It will still sound just as good. Normalization does no harm to the audio - it's merely a playback volume setting.",
