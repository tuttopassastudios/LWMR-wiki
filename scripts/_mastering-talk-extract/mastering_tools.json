    "content": "Been trying to think of a way in to the question about what I did without being completely frustrating or giving a list of moves that don't mean anything outside of the context of being in my chair, hearing what and how I hear.\n\nThis process for this song is like any other...listen for what the song needs and act accordingly. That's the frustrating answer but it's also true. What did you do? \"I mastered it.\" lol\n\nBut I know that's not what you're asking. For a track like this, I'm primarily focused on the vocal and how it's sitting and feeling. The vocal performance is incredibly dynamic and intimate. This one had some ringy stuff through 2.5k and in the upper mid range that I felt was detracting from the \"fireside\" intimacy. The goal was to take off some of the edge without stepping on the presence. That was a combo of RX and EQ. \n\nOn this song, I did an analog pass because I am usually able to manage to get the balance of presence and de-edge I'm looking for very quickly. Since time was of the essence here, that was the move. Couple of moves on Equilibrium digitally before the Gyraf and Porter Grinder in the analog chain. The \"trickiest\" thing I did here was flip the Porter Grinder into M/S to bring the vocal closer into the center (by cutting!) and to push the mellotron and atmospherics to the sides (by boosting). All very subtle stuff.\n\nSo, there were some moves here, but the moves were all in service of the feeling the song was telling me it needed. We talk a lot about monitoring here. When you can connect to the song and walk around inside of it, it's much easier to know what you need to do (or not to do) to bring it to life.",

Each attack/release time is given a distortion and masking score and the best score is selected. The different IRC modes prioritize different types of scores (eg. IRC I prioritizes low pumping and distortion, IRC II is similar to IRC I but prioritizes transients more, etc). \nIzotope is a little cagey on the exact process they use to arrive at each IRC mode, but the manual does a pretty good job of explaining how each mode feels. IRC IV Transient is basically a multiband version of the other IRC modes that prioritizes transients, although Izotope says IRC V is its first multiband limiter in Ozone, so there is maybe more to the story there",

I typically reduce the limiting amount around 2dB, sometimes more sometimes less. I\u2019ll also re balance clipper and limiter relationships\n\n2) Don\u2019t do any pre-emptive processing with the exceptions perhaps of paying a little extra care if it\u2019s a project with heavy sibilance. Don\u2019t mono the bass, don\u2019t change the EQ etc \n\n3) Make a single WAV file of each side, and a set of timing notes that show where each track starts and the length so the cutting engineer can place the track banding / markers\n\n4) I like to highlight anomalies that may present a challenge for cutter but it\u2019s not necessary",

It was developed with Helmut Erler who was at Dubplates for many years\u2026really amazing dude and friend of mine. \u00a0He's cut some really important techno records. \u00a0I think the visualization of the cutter head and the grooves will start to make sense to a lot of people that are a bit in the dark about cutting and modulation and how program material can really affect how things sound ultimately\u2026also how you process your master esp when it goes to plants that do in house cuts that are a bit on the safe/boring side. \u00a0You can get ahead and provide a master that counteracts some of the wide processing moves they make to avoid distortion at all cost.  Also send your client a ref of what your cut could sound esp when people push back on super long programs that don't translate well https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-simulathe-ref/",

So my approach has been to take all my mixes and bypass the limiter and  load the sequence up. I\u2019ll also have my limited mixes below my unlimited mixes in this session. Most the work I\u2019m doing is light rx work and a touch of eq but mostly trying various limiters and limiter settings to see if I can beat what I did in the mix. The real advantage of mastering my own mixes is that once I move heard them in the final sequence I\u2019ll sometimes adjust minor things in the mix. Maybe vocal up or bass down ect.. rather than trying to solve this with 2bus processing. The down side of me mastering is not getting a trusted second perspective",

Can't be afraid for people to tell you did too much, if you are truly just trying to connect with the song.\n\nEven great mixes sometimes, from great mixers, need to be pulled far on occasion. And -- sometimes great mixes can actually take MORE. \n\nBand specific upward expansion to shape groove, master rebalance, heavy band specific satuaration to make things pop in a different way, I've done it all. Last week I had a master with CGII, 3 instances of Weiss DS-1 doing compression, expansion, de-essing, Spectre. Even Gold Clip. Which is rare, but if it needs it it needs it. \n\nIntroduce contrasts if needed.\n\nJust be unafraid, and love it (I know you will). There are no rules. Lean the fuck in!",

And a limiter.\n\nSince then I've done at least over 100 songs, many of which are out in the world and/or on their way to release. So a decent time to circle back with some insight. However, compared to more experienced ears on here I am still a baby.\n\nExtremely powerful challenge from Ruairi, and it really made me think in broad terms about what EQ is doing, what my goals are when using it, and how each part relates to another. And what you gain or lose when making a move. I would highly recommend it, and found it very very hard. It's non-trivial to make things sound better when you actually hear what's happening.\n\n I've also been pretty lucky to work on quite a bit of music that I would have considered outside of my experience range, and I think this gentler approach worked well there because the mixes were already pretty damn good. So there's that too!\n\nOf course for work where I'm being paid I'm not only restricting to one band, I do whatever is needed but even so many times I would prefer that. It felt like \"learning scales\" but for mastering in a way. And loudness really is down mostly to EQ, as far as I can tell!",

This is an email that Nomogrpah wrote back to a client that said \"Hey I love the master so much but I am a bit worried about how much it might get turned down ?\" or something to that effect \n\nResponse was \n\n\"Glad you are feeling the master!\n\nRe the level thing that is a complicated question. A few thoughts\n\nNot everyone has loudness normalization turned on. It also doesn\u2019t exist on Smart TVs, many streaming web interfaces etc\n\nThe different services all have different level norm targets (and even different settings within just Spotify) - and they change pretty regularly\n\nIn terms of absolute level when normalization is active what matters is arrangement (dense mixes sound quieter than sparse/spacious mixes), EQ (bright/mid range forward mixes sound louder than dark) and distortion levels (clipped/distorted mixes feel perceptually louder than clean). If I make a master a dB louder in mastering using just limiting for example, they just turn it down a dB more when it\u2019s level normed.\n\nSo what does all of this mean? It means that every song has sweet spot where the EQ/tone, the arrangement and the overall clipping/limiting level works best and communicates the intent. That\u2019s what we aim for.\n\nYou can use a site like loudnesspenalty.com to see what will happen but it will just drive you crazy and the only real way to meaningfully alter the result is to change the arrangement/mix or overall EQ a lot. On release day you can find 1000 records that are louder than yours if you want to.\n\nIf being the loudest is the intent - game everything listed above and you can \u201cwin\u201d. If doing your unique thing and communicating a song and a performance is the goal then I think you are there!\"\n\n(posted with Nomographs permission)",

For you the sample rate conversion algo may be the difference to get that extra 2%. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the sample rate stuff doesn\u2019t matter, but as you said, it\u2019s important to understand where we all are at, where our time is best spent, and when to utilize or worry about certain things!!\n\nWill be back next week would love to go deeper on some of this!",

    "content": "Yeah. I immediately change the frequency graph to *Log* or *Extended Log*. This allows me to see the low-end and midrange with more resolution. It's the same reason most EQ graphs keep the octaves evenly spaced so that 50% of your freq graph isn't 10kHz and up. It gives you more resolution for the notes in the lower octaves.\n\nAs for FFT size or window shape, I never change it, but as Ruairi alluded to it requires an understanding of the physical limitations of FFT's. \n\nIn short if you want very fine frequency information displayed you can change the window size and lose rhythmic information. But it you want very precise rhythmic visualization you have to sacrifice how much frequency information the FFT can display. So the ideal setting ultimately depends on what problem you're trying to solve.",

Unless it\u2019s something wild, better to have the client have a wonderful experience, keep their momentum, don\u2019t introduce doubt, double down on their confidence, etc.\n\nI\u2019m assuming it would be something like making sure the levels and overall tone are right if you\u2019ve already mastered them all and they are in the same ballpark, but feel free to tell me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAlso \u201ccohesion\u201d is massively overrated to me anyway, I much prefer a creatively interesting and varied listening experience if the music calls for it as long as we are not having wild level or EQ swings or something (sometimes it calls for cohesion to have the best listening experience IMO, so know that too!). \n\nI\u2019ve had multiple instances where an artist\u2019s new \u201csingle\u201d release includes their several past singles I\u2019ve mastered too. They didn\u2019t tell me they were doing that, and I mastered each totally alone, just based on the song and their vision. And to be honest those collections sounded totally fine every time as a group of singles, mastered alone.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019d definitely politely educate them on what it exactly entails so it doesn\u2019t happen again in future, and so they can take it into account creatively.\n\nBut of course where you are in your career, the relationship with this client, etc all plays into this. Someone like @Nomograph Mastering could very well see this very differently than me",

Hoping he hasn't trademarked this one so the Discord doesn't get shut down.\n\n\n\n\"Remember the early Elton John records? Remember how his piano shimmered? At mediasound we loved that sound so a lot of us were always playing around with getting different versions of it. No lacquered hammers, no Dolby A off, just a combination of compression and EQ.\n\n\nI only recorded Luther's voice, may he rest in peace, on that song along with \"searching\" and then mixed both. Luther was on a whole other level of singers. He walked into that session and listened to the song in the control room once, then he walked out into the studio with the lyric sheet in his hand. What you hear on\"Glow of Love\" and \"searching\" is his first fun down reading the lyrics from a yellow pad. No punches.\n\n\nThe piano sound you\u2019re referring to is probably the same one that I did for Vandross on the \u201cNever too much\u201d song.\n\n\nOk, this is how you do it.\n\n1. First insert an LA3A or LA2A (depending on the version of sound you\u2019re going after) across the stereo piano tracks. The LA2A is good if the song is slow and the chords are quarter notes. The LA3A is good if the chords are faster with a harder attack like in \u201cnever too much\u201d. Bang those meters and \n2. out of the compressor go into a couple of pultecs and push up..way up the 3 or 5 k on the low end and the 8 or 10 k on the high end. Don\u2019t be safe. \n3. Now go to the desk EQ and start clearing out some of the muddiness and EQ up the remaining mids so that it just shimmers like a baby. \n4. When it\u2019s done right, you can hear the harmonics riding up during each sustain.  \n5. I remember hearing that song on the radio and man that piano was making me feel good all over. Sounds pretty simple when you know how to do it right?\u201d",

(Swapping limiters for something *safer* can be equally damaging) \n\nWhat does clipping actually do? It creates square waves at the extreme (for the duration of the clipping)\n\nWhat is a square wave? It is a fundamental with a bunch of odd harmonics trailing off in level\n\nWhat happens when you low pass the square wave at the converter reconstruction filter, lathe low pass etc? It is no longer a square wave\n\nDoes cutting this no longer square wave to a disc for brief periods present challenges and cause extra momentary distortion? Yes\n\nIs that trade off worth while? I believe so and have itterated on this belief across hundreds and hundreds of projects cut and pressed to vinyl and then compared carefully with the original digital files",

    "content": "I\u2019ve found it easier to separate the tonal decisions from loudness decisions. I take the limiter out of the equation when I am making tonal decisions. So in my case, it's a simple bypass of with processing vs. without to make the decisions against the mix. This is inherently level matched. This gets trickier with dynamics processing but that\u2019s a simple offset of the processed mix. That\u2019s all happening on the object in my DAW without need for additional plugins or routing. Since I am rarely compressing anyways, this is a low friction way of judging the moves against the mix. \n\nWhen I\u2019m happy with that, I\u2019ll print the pre-lim and then load it up on another track to do the limiting. When I\u2019m happy with the limiting, I have a quick action to create an A/B track where I can load the hot mix or mix to see if I\u2019m as loud or louder than it. \n\nNone of this is by number or meter. It\u2019s all by ear.",

    "content": "I always end up chasing my tail when separating tonal and loudness. If I get the right tonal balance first, then everything shifts around when adding loudness/limiting. To me all limiters and limiter styles within have different tones, at least if I\u2019m limiting more then a couple of dB. For that reason I always start with finding the right limiter/style that keeps or changes the tonal balance the way I want (too bright mix = dark limiter, dull mix = bright limiter, great mix = limiter that keeps the balance when pushed ect.). Once I have the loudness and given the tonal balance a gentle push in the right direction with the limiter, I get the track over the finish line with eq or other tools in front of the limiter. \n\nThis is not meant as criticism of your approach, I just haven\u2019t cracked that code.\nHats of to you for making that work!",

Consider what deliverable is needed (default for me is to deliver sample rate of what it came in at, 24 bit).\n\n3. Consider how high your output ceiling should be based on the type of arrangement, etc. True Peak could play a role in this depending on the type of record\n\n4. If there are alts, make sure they are aligned and exactly the same length as the main mix (again easy to check length in RX)\n\n5. If you are doing SRC (say they need a 48k and 44k 16bit deliverable) check the SRC file as well to ensure that the SRC did not introduce any overs \u2014 it will quantize them to zero if you dither after but best to check still",

    "content": "That makes sense, thanks for the explanation. Reading this, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re miles appart. I used to have one \u00abdefault\u00bb limiter and focus all my moves in front of that, also adding limiter/loudness as the last step. When doing so, I always found myself having to tweak the moves (that I already had \u00abperfectly\u00bb dialed in) because everything would change when adding the final limiter. That\u2019s when I would be chasing my tail \ud83d\ude05\nNow I start with getting the limiter right for the song and then doing eq moves as the second step. This way it it a lot less back and forth for me. I should say I only use one limiter at the time and the limiters I audition with are dmg limitless, fabfilter pro-l2 and Ozone maximizer, with styles I know well. Dmg usually gets used on acoustic and jazz, pro-l2 & ozone for pop/rock. If it is music with vocals I find different styles can really change the way the vocals are percieved, so it\u2019s mostly chosing the style that support the vocals best that is the goal. Using two minuttes to get the right limiter from the start saves me time and uncertainty down the road, and in some cases let\u2019s me use less eq to get the desired result.\nThere are many roads to Rome as they say, I was just interested in yours bc whenever I tried that it ended in a lot of second guessing (for me!). \n\nDo you find yourself having to add more eq when adding limiter at the end to keep the tonal balance you have acheived?",

    "content": "Hey. There\u2019s nothing wrong with putting EQs and limiters on your master buss as you mix. A little bit of EQ or a lot of limiter is alright.\n\nThe answer here is to mix *into* your limiter. You don\u2019t want to mix the entire song and then slap a limiter on at the end for loudness. As you\u2019ve discovered that will mess up the balances that you\u2019ve spent so much time getting right. You want to ease the final limiting in as you\u2019re building the mix.\n\nI usually start a mix by pulling my limiter down a few dB. Enough to get everything starting to touch the limiter. To get the loudness in the ballpark.\n\nThen I\u2019ll push into it a little more so that I\u2019m starting to get some gain reduction. Certain instruments may begin to get pushed down or distorted in a way I don\u2019t like. Maybe the kick is hitting the limiter too hard, so I bring it\u2019s level down and then lower my limiter some more.\n\nContinue this process of adjusting balances into your limiter as you mix until you\u2019ve got the loudness where you want it. Usually I\u2019m checking in on my limiter a few times throughout the mix to see if I can push it harder without penalty. When I hear it distort in a way that I don\u2019t like I back off.\n\nHope that helps some.",

    "content": "...so, the short answer jack is yes , the wide q eq moves are definitely advantageous and applicable outside of the mastering stage (for my workflow)....very much so. I think in a way , the broad eq is sort of like a painter taking a few steps back from the canvas having been working up close on a detailed brushstroke (which I\u2019d suggest for example is like a surgical eq move in a mix or saturating a sound at the production stage etc).....\u201dstepping back\u201d and listening not just to The minutiae but the overall tone i think is a discipline that is potentially easy to forget in mix mode ......and in a sense this is how the broad EQ is serving me . I find the eq points ruairi shared work v well at the group bus stage also......for light touches\n\nWith regards to whether I\u2019m only mastering . No, currently my most common paid work comes from local / independent artists in my network I\u2019ve built mostly from my local community outwards through word of mouth. This is primarily in the rnb/trap/hip-hop genres and for better or worse it appears to have been normalised that when someone wants a mix....what they want is a mixter. I\u2019m with Derek Ali\u2019s Enginears platform and even there they are promoting a free master from us as mixers on the platform.\nPersonally, I\u2019m not against certain mixers mastering as well....but i think this is more genre specific.....and also v much down to the individual. I think you spoke about your arc on here into mastering and others have too. ....i believe there is much to benefit from having professional mastering engineers, with thousands of hours under their belt listening to thousands of tracks in excellent environments......take the final listen and make the final adjustments on a mix..and for me, i consider myself on a career arc towards becoming that .",

I was more hybrid earlier on during my conversion period and now mostly all in due to my workflow and client time demands.\n\nI definitely feel like i\u2019m chasing Refs with the same plugins used by mixers and producers sometimes and don\u2019t feel creative but that\u2019s the game lately. I really feel this is the main problem. I\u2019m not really happy when i\u2019m pushed in that direction.\nWith almost everyone having the same plugins it\u2019s very apparent that most masters in a shootout sound the same now. No surprises there.\n\nIs Analog Better?\n\nI recently bought a Terry Audio CEQ to try and change my sound and it definitely works. It has an amazing sound and color that cannot be found in most plugins. That being said it doesn\u2019t work for me all the time.\nMany of the projects i work on are so loud and pushed anything run through analog gear loses the \u201cglue\u201d that is in the digital mix.\nI also just got a Sontec MES-432D9D from Make Believe Studios.\nIt actually sounds like the real thing to me. It has a much different vibe when using it. I find myself using different frequencies from other EQs.\nIs That Better? I\u2019m not sure yet but getting good results when i use both of these tools.\n\nI think the most important part of my setup is that I\u2019m very familiar with my plugins and know when to use different ones when necessary (its also so easier to try another one if you\u2019re not sure obviously)\nI\u2019m constantly trying to stay fresh and not mail it in.\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s an actual answer for this but i hope i answered some of your question or at least validated our situation.\n\nChris\"*",

I think you kind of answered your own questions. $10 is crazy low and not sustainable for anyone, I'm not sure what that other engineer could actually be doing besides blasting tracks through Ozone. Since you are already cold emailing, I think your time could be better sent searching out artists who are in need of an ME and get your full rate there. If you took the $10/gigs, they would eventually be dropped anyways as more full rate gigs started coming in. If it were me, I would rather work the word of mouth game through the artists you are DMing and hopefully more gigs stream in that way via other artists, producers, or mixers. Put in the work now creating meaningful relationships and connections that can exponentially grow instead of the label path which seems like a dead end. I've been cold DMing artists with a freebie first song, I just started this month and it's a big numbers game, so I can't say for certain how it will go. But, because of the freebie I gave them, I am now talking with these different artists about mastering an album, an EP, and several singles at full rate. This is rhetorical, but how many cheap label songs would you need to master in order to get the same amount of money? So in short, if it were me, I would spend my time elsewhere creating more meaningful relationships with much more room to grow.",

    "content": "From my side I always want to keep working with people -- you never know how the relationships evolve (I know you know this, you are more experienced than me). I just tackle the notes -- it's rare I would ever say it wasn't a great experience. I want to master as many records as I can. At the very most I would let them come back again, say it's not the right fit and suggest someone I know to be a good fit (I've done this before). But always with the art and their vision first, if I truly don't understand it.\n\nThat said -- I did get really close to walking on a recent project, we were way down a rabbit hole, I think I legitimately did 15 masters. And we were caught up on dither, comparing to pink noise, etc. It was wild. We got it across the line - but I went way out of what would be constituted by us as what the \"mastering role\" should say, because the music was great and I thought the artist could understand my perspective. And I think it actually hit, to refocus on the art and feeling. \n\nIt's a fine line. Sometimes I get the impression that I do step out of what is supposed to be said by mastering engineers -- but people seem to connect with that on my side. \n\nAlso if things are going that way I will just stream it to them -- often they are looking for control or are having a hard time making decisions -- something I see in this new crop of record makers who only have ever worked in a DAW. Hard to know without actually knowing the humans\n\nThen again, many many times I get a note and it's great and insightful and I love it",

Generally I got his concept and certainly understand when he talked about becoming so good at sound design he felt he could effectively mimic any master. It all made sense to me , my surprise is particular to the plug in. I don\u2019t know if anyone else has here experience of it, but after all the fanfare when it was released I\u2019ve found the J unusable but Clearly he didn\u2019t. So I was surprised by the choice specifically. Also I suppose, knowing that Ali mixes hybrid and sums his groups through analogue ssl boards as part of his workflow, it seems ironic to me to think after all that it gets put straight into an emulation of one channel  of said board. \n\nI personally like the bpm thing as I do 60;000 /bpm/measure  to dial in a quick ballpark release time (in ozone dynamics) then tweak by feel at  volume . It lets me get to the pulse I want quickly ime , I\u2019m going to have  a good read of the link shared above on the L2  over a coffee now, thanks for sharing  @Adam Thein",

On analog limiters I only like the Maselec MPL-2, which I just nabbed one recently. Had used it in a former mentor's studio and dearly missed it for years. Only analog purchase in a long time. No other analog limiter ever worked for me - the Pendulum PL-2 crackled and I couldn't trust it. Plugin limiters are just so superior. Also no interest in Bettermaker here. Tons of them show up used too - bad sign?",

    "content": "The Massive Passive is a beautiful EQ and does \"the thing\" exceptionally well...it's just not as versatile as I've come to need out of a box if I'm going out because it has inherent trade-offs that make it only partially useful when its in the signal path. I found myself only ever consistently using the top 2 bands because of the low-end mushiness. When I'm talking low-end mushiness, we are talking really subtle shades of gray, but at this stage can really make or break how a master hits, especially when thumpy kick drums are so critical to almost everything. It works a treat on drumless/acoustically oriented stuff, but that's more the exception of what flows across my desk than the rule. \n\nWhat I moved on to from the MP (the Gyraf G14S) gives me what I want when I'm going out without the inherent trade off in the low end. The ability to use it in either solid state or tube topology made it a no-brainer for me. It just does \"the thing\" cleaner and better than the MP. Where the MP is rich and dark, the Gyraf is rich and cleaner. I think at the end of the day, \"tube\" wasn't the thing I was looking for.",

    "content": "So, in most cases, you can go over 0 dB in your DAW if you're working in 32-bit (or higher) precision, and you won\u2019t necessarily hear the clipping. This is because the internal audio engine can handle peaks above 0 without immediate distortion\u2014it\u2019s all about floating-point processing magic.\n\nNow, whether the audio gets normalized to stay under 0 dB depends on what happens during export. Sometimes, what you're seeing in the DAW or Ozone meters isn\u2019t exactly what ends up in the final file\u2014especially if there's a limiter, normalization, or post-processing involved. It\u2019s even possible that the version you\u2019re analyzing wasn\u2019t actually the one that was officially released. Happens more often than you\u2019d think!\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not unusual to see mixes or masters that are technically clipping more so going over 0... in tools like Ozone or the DAW but sound fine due to the flexibility of floating-point processing. I\u2019m not saying this is a best practice\u2014but I\u2019ve definitely played around with it. I\u2019ve even intentionally clipped files way past 0 dB, re-exported them, and compared them to cleaner versions. They sounded different, but at that point, I found myself asking, \u201cWhy am I trying to squeeze one more dB of loudness out of something that\u2019s already crushed and competitive?\u201d Classic overthinking, right?\n\nAnyway, back to your question: I think what you\u2019re seeing is a product of the DAW working internally at 32- or 64-bit, so it can handle those overs without clipping during processing. Then, during export, maybe they normalized it, maybe they fixed it later, maybe it did just didn't sound distroted haha... or maybe that\u2019s just not the real released version at all. Who knows?  I would not lose sleep over it and also know what you have seen is not a \"secret\" that your missing haha.",

BUT i ran numbers of time vs money etc about 9 years ago.. and the cost of running alts and the benefit of a flat rate vs explaining to clients cost, and nickel and dime or they come back later and then i had to charge etc. Its way easier for me to run it all right awawy and just call it done. You can make plentyyyyy of money by doing this method and you remove friction and the potential fear in their mind that theres always an upcharge. For me this has played out massively over 14 years of client loyalty and peace of mind. Its a time suck  .. i usuall do invoices during this time... ive done assistance etc.. over they years but then its me paying the assistant to run alts which  is not a high level skill and managing them on some level. Long term you can for sure make a killing just doing it yourself and also the client seems to really enjoy knowing its a turn key process. The  main thing for ths is making sure your charging a high enough rate to start with which isnt really \"hard\" .... its just a matter of presenting the value and sticking to your rate. Customer service is worth a LOT and especially with referrals. Ill get gigs just because of the above method. Time yourslef how long it takes to do the alts, work the numbers and youll find if your charging a \"pro\" rate.. its not a  problem. Now of course if you dont want to do it.. thats a different conversation and fine, get an assistant. ALSO RX batch and some other programs people mention can make it extremely fast with a few clicks of the button.",

    "content": "@Stefan Hi Stephen, this is a great question! \nThere are two issues at play here: One the more obvious, sending the signal to multiple A/D\u2019s, and then, maybe a little less obvious: the issue of how your system is being clocked, and whether the A/D you\u2019re auditioning is exerting maximum performance based on these conditions. Personally, to feed multiple converters, I use a Maselec MTC 1x console. This offers two identical outputs. So the analog signal part of that is solved right there. There are other ways to address this problem like outboard switchers. \n\nBut here\u2019s the real problem, clocking. *Generally*, and when i say generally probably in almost 100 percent of cases, the A/D converter sounds its best when it is the master clock of your system. Of course there are *certain* converters that *may* benefit from external clocking, but I\u2019m not jumping into that can of worms. You can read ENDLESS arguments on Gearspace about this. \n\nI\u2019ll say up front that I think clock sounds best just getting transferred straight through the AES audio feed to your interface, vs using a BNC output to your system, but again, I could get pushback there, that\u2019s my opinion. \n\nSo- let\u2019s get to it, you have two A/D\u2019s running AES feeds into your interface. Now, on your interface itself- you need to choose what AES feed your choosing to Sync to- so you\u2019re going to choose one aes feed, or the other. This doesn\u2019t *preclude you* from solo\u2019ing each feed in your DAW. But the main thing here is that when you audition one converter, you need to also go to your control panel of your interface and select that AES feed to sync if you really want to hear the correct sound. \n\nIn sum, I would do it this way and record a 30-45 pass of each. Then audition them that way (i use comp lanes on the same track to achieve this).\n\nAnother possible way to do this is having an outboard aes switcher like a z sys and switching the converters to the same aes output. Hope this helps!",

I\u2019m generally happy with the results/loudness I get and comfortable with the parameters, except I never really mess with the \u201ccharacter\u201d which I suppose is the speed/release of the limiting? \n\nOn a recent mix I slowed it down more than I ever would, which really just means making it slower at all from the defaul setting, I usually stick very close to it, and I really like how it made the pocket of my mix feel. But I guess, I have always understood people to use very fast release compression on masterbusses.. \n\ndo you all find yourselves moving the character/release of the final limiter around pretty widely to get the right feel or are you typically keeping it quite fast?",

You can slow it down and get a cleaner sound ... and while you then lose a bit of volume you can then actually limit it more to make it back up. I notice when i move it to slow i lose about .2-.4 db in final level, so then I can gain it back up and take that \"off\" in the limiter. This might sound silly haha.. but it gets me the same \"loudness\" of the \"loud\" setting while being cleaner. Sometimes i just use loud though when it sounds right haha. this is not a perfect science but general observation and application haha.",

    "content": "T-racks classic clipper does some stuff in the low-end. Can't remember it exactly but it's a little bump and a HP I believe (should do measurements again). On some material it can work quite nicely but it's quite situational imo. Standardclip by SIR is my go to most of the time (and since I'm in FL i get to use the fruity soft clipper, which is \"the secret\" to that \"FL studio sound\" all these protools engineers keep talking about. They think it's the fruity limiter, but FL producers have moved on from that because it sounds really bad, everyone uses the soft clipper and it's amazing for hiphop drums.)\nFor limiters I use a few, sometimes combinations (using multiple limiters spreads the workload a bit). I love the ozone vintage limiter, but I always use it in very small amounts, barely any gr. Fabfilter L2 is popular for a reason, can't really go wrong with that one imo. Waves L1 can work sometimes, but i rarely use it on a mixbus. Weiss by softube is a cool collection, Newfangled Elevate is nice too.\nNow that I think of it the Elysia alpha compressor also has a softclip function that I utilize sometimes.",

Or if it\u2019s ended up more aggressive I\u2019ll pull it back and usually end up with it grabbing maybe ~3dB on loud drum hits, maybe more here and there.

Of course I'm going to do a full listen to all the alt versions, but they often have exactly the same issues (click here, pop there, or a drum peak or two to be gained down). Thought it would be nice if there was a way to essentially copy-paste the processing moves I want to do from the main mix to the alts as needed instead of doing it all manually again.",

    "content": "What @hyanrarvey and others said...but usually this is used to get a bounce with the compression to make sure it is releasing in time with the groove. In gridded stuff like hip-hop you can actually be really mathematic with it, but generally you don't need to it's about the feel. Of course every compressor is different even with the same \"settings\"...you can set the attack to let enough transient in and the release to basically make the compressor return to \"zero\" in time with the movement of the groove. But the release shape, etc will definitely play a role in this too\n\nAt least this is how I'm usually using it (though very rarely compressing at all, and when I do I'm using the Weiss DS1-Mk3 plug which has complicated release characteristics). Feel free to correct me if I'm off the mark on this! It is about feel and making the record pump in a pleasing way which can add energy. But of course it's helpful to be very specific about what part of the groove you're actually wanting to bring out (or back) so to me it's hugely about your gut reaction to how the groove moves you",

Basically due to the lag in the GUI. Does this not happen to you? I see no way around it\n\nOf course if this is a repeated process you can take into account the time for windows to open, buttons to be clicked, edits to be placed, etc because you know exactly which ones they are but in the context we are discussing it by definition is something we don\u2019t do the same every time.\n\nI do love what you described as a way to automate other things, specifically file grouping/naming/etc!\n\nEDIT: I actually may be wrong about this! Looking into it will report back. If there is a way to just set a default short time between actions it may solve the issues I described",

In my case that was a dual TRS to 4 pin XLR adapter that hooked to a balanced headphone cable I already had. I make cables all the time but it was still kind of a pain.

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering  and anyone else doing deep edits in RX for mastering, how do you deal with artist sending an updated mix or asking for tweaks but keeping the same master processing? I guess I use RX a lot less than you but I find it quite hard to keep up with the tweaks i\u2019ve made. Like today I mastered a record and I always do it in pro tools, where I can easily see any edits i\u2019ve made and processing on the fader and then i can swap the wav file and recreate the edits quite quickly. Just trying to understand your workflow as quite often I\u2019m a little put off by using RX just as it means leaving Pro Tools which adds a layer of confusion.",

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering  right, ruari class finished ! .....ok so, ive a lot of thoughts ...this exercise has made a v big impression on me .\nOff top, \n\nAccording to RX The mix is at -7.2 LUFS integrated , -6.3 short term, TP -0.1\n\nThe artist wants a \"bit more low-end \" on a fast paced, alt/pop/rock track.\nAnd Imo a little air on top would compliment the mix.\n(starting at -7.2 is loud for my experience so its a good challenge and these sort of Lufs are what i want to become v comfortable working at where currently im more comfortable around -9.)\n\nSO i start with your 10 eq points in place , with your q settings and .5 db limits in fabfilter pro q 3  .\n\nThoughts:\n\nIt became clear immediately how powerful to me these q settings and eq points are, with regards to re-shaping the tonal balance.\nI cannot recall ever having only used these curves , nor in the absence of any other processing. \nListening to the impact of 0.1 db up or down in the different areas was remarkable. \n\nAfter half an hour id got to something i was v happy with, that appeared \"Louder \" to me and also.....a bit more lows and a little more open on top. Which id call a success.\n\nId brought the Pro q output down 0.4db to compensate the gain increase and printed with no limiter.\n\nIn RX this printed version showed as -7.2 LUFS integrated , -6.3 short term, TP 0.0 .\n\nIdeally id have not touched this again.....i really liked it. \n\nFollowing instructions i then put the L2 Limiter on (modern mode , +0.1 db, TP on and output -0.1) .\n\nTruth be told, once id put the limiter on i wanted to go back into the EQ because i didnt like the sound anymore, i felt the L2 spoilt it.",

If anyone is using Simulathe I would love to get your feedback on it.  I know @hebakadry and @Bonati12461 mentioned it but I think you were using it in conjunction with your actual lathes.",

    "content": "@Nomograph Mastering  hi ruairi so I\u2019m on my third listen to \u201ctunnel under ocean boulevard \u201c and have been really enjoying it . It\u2019s got a vibe of  a david lynch movie about a singer who is the love child of dusty Springfield and Elvis who grew up with Kate bush on tour with Tom waits and roger waters . Anyhoo I digress ! If I may ask as much as poss without asking you to divulge anything compromising about the process : I am fascinated by a few things and wonder what your approach was . In many parts this work feels almost like a  poetry with orchestration and I think has extended parts with little or quite subtle drum parts . I wonder with something like this how do you judge how hard (or not ) to push the overall level (both individual tracks and all together ) as for me I think I tend to judge off what the drums / bass dictates w/regard to level . In this case where drums and bass aren\u2019t really dominating , I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be as confident in knowing what is the right level . After all there are periods of soft vocal and very gentle lush strings \u2026..these sorts of passages I might get a bit unsure In . I also wondered did you stay in the box for this one ? \u2026.and was this a project for mostly eq more than comp/limiting ? The sound of the record is v expensive and classic imo , do you treat a record like this completely differently with regards to what processes you might use on a different genre (again ITB vs analogue chains ) . Also , I wondered how long did you have to master this ? I\u2019m v interested by engineers abilities not just to perform but to perform to deadlines . It seems this record could go badly wrong if the right choices aren\u2019t made (where a clipped crushed mix could be more forgiving) I wonder how much time you get to review the moves you make on a project like this and if/when you don\u2019t have much time \u2026.do you ever play it safe ?/ make less bold moves in the absence of time to review them ?",

    "content": "Crew! Question regarding putting out a project with previous masters. Situation is I'm doing an EP, it has a couple new mixes that I'm mastering and a couple previous songs that have been released already. But the new mixes are in much better shape than even the old masters...so I sorta want to tweak the old masters lightly to get a little more cohesion.\n\nWhen doing this and putting out the new project, I know the artist wants the old songs to essentially be counted as the \"same\"...so the plays, etc count towards the same track.\n\nI'm familiar that some distributors allow you to essentially use the ISRC from the previous song to do this and make sure it all tracks...but will the files being slightly different (just light light light EQ basically, exactly the same length/etc) cause any issues here?",

Was getting fed up of mixing records I didn't like so my main thing now is to only mix records I like and probably going forward only mix records for people going on my label. Means I can be really selective which works better for me because I've been through so many shit situations in the last 2 years. (This story is one of many). Through everything, I've learned that I care far too much about pleasing the artist and I jumped through way too many hoops to do so. In future, I will give less of a shit. Which sounds like a terrible idea, but really I'm just trying to dial back my obsessive behaviour. In terms of technicals, I learned nothing in the situation, artist could hear something that fucked everything up for them, I could hear nothing, none of my peers could hear what the artist was talking about either. Was only the mastering chain, as the mix was fine. I turned off every plugin individually to get at the issue and it remained. I think it was a combination of things, but I've never had anyone pinpoint the issue before and admittedly I mostly use the same combination of plugins for my mastering jobs (for functionality reasons, not because this specific combination of plugins make the records 'sound' better).",

I thought maybe they knew something I didn\u2019t.\n\nSo I tried it. I put a gain plugin before my limiter and pushed the limiter with it. The results? It sounds awful. All the punch and width is gone. Change back to using the limiter\u2019s threshold, sounds great.\n\nAny technical reason for this? I was using the Kilohearts Gain plugin in to Ozone Maximizer, but I would be hard pressed if it was one of those plugins at fault. Maybe the threshold of the limiter has an internal signal flow that changes its behavior as opposed to gain coming in to it or something? Maybe this workflow makes better sense in Sequoia for the Sterling engineers for some reason?",

    "content": "Hey All! My Mixbus chain has been a combination of the god particle limiter, and Ozone 11 and sometimes a Fabfilter L2 after, but usually just the God Particle to an Ozone. I've noticed lately, that when I go God Particle to Fabfilter L2, the sides of the music push out significantly more. I've been getting more clarity in the instrumentation of my mixes. The compromise is less saturation, but I think I like the separation (the fabfilter or Ozone limiter was only ever doing 1-2dB of work, but still completely changing that final spectrum. I'm having trouble telling how soon my mixes overload with the Pro L-2 unfortunately. Do you think wider is better? or is a trick and it's too wide, and all that width is overload? I have trouble detecting overload in my Insight2 Plugin, I only notice it on phone speakers after the fact.",

My approach was to build that density up from scratch, but to keep the 2bus streamlined. Set the vocal at the absolute level it needed to be and built rest of mix around that. 2 bus = Ozone maximizer doing -2.8 db. SO chuffed, everyone super happy. V1 signoff vibes etc. Come print and prep day, I pull up WLM to check levels etc and see Ive got 4.6 db true peak overshoot that ozone let through. (Basically every snare hit) Properly painted myself into a corner\u2026Ive got 1 db at most to turn down before artist becomes bummed. True peak limiting =really kills the vibe. Actually, any move to mitigate the overshoot makes it sound contrived/distorted and less open than the 4db true peak. So my Question- what am I risking downstream if I keep as is?",

I always read and learn from the great stuff you share around here, and I thought it'd be cool to share something out of the ordinary that I did today for this particular situation. I was tasked with mastering a r&b/pop song with a kick and 808 really upfront, but they weren't cutting through or punching in the low/mids due to lack of EQ on the kick and saturation on the 808. (And no time to make corrections!)\n\nTo fill in what was missing, I tried a few things, but what worked best for me to address both issues was sending it to a parallel devil-loc (which is killer for adding low-mids and saturation), and using the Ozone imager to make it only sound from 500Hz downwards and make it mono. Luckily, they sent me the music and the lead vocals separately, so I was able to do this without compromising the vocal color. For this particular situation, it worked beautifully. Cheers!",

    "content": "+ @Rollmottle , you know what, poor word choice on my part by saying \u201cundoing\u201d, haha. What I really meant was in the event of a revision request. \n\nFor example, I worked on a song this week with a jazz quartet instrumentation and a singer with a bit of a lisp. Super dynamic mix, the upright bass had a lot of wild moments that needed to be reigned in. Always gonna follow my gut on the to first pass, but also recognize the singer\u2019s potential sensitivity to how their lisp comes across on the recording. I just opted to focus on the instrumentals on the first pass in RX, save the file, duplicate it, then work from that and focus on vocals. They approved on the first pass, but if I had to go back to the drawing board on the vocals, for example, I did not want to have to go through every note plucked on the upright bass again and would be thankful to have that \u2018RX_INST\u2019 file on hand.\n\nWhich I guess brings up another workflow question: are you splitting focus when in RX and doing multiple passes, or just play through once addressing whatever it is you hear as you go?",

On the Weiss EQ1, I use both standard and linear phase modes; most of the time, one just works better than the other and is usually noticeable. It\u2019s one of those things that I\u2019ve stopped trying to intellectualize and just go with what sounds best on a per-case basis. It\u2019s very hard to specify exact scenarios where one will always be better than the other, at least for music production!

When I (a mixer) get hired to do a mix/master for an indie client, I often feel like I lack some knowledge about the technical side of *delivering* a proper master. Is there a sort of checklist that I could have in terms of making sure the master file I deliver goes through a similar QC process as a pro master would? Things like dithering, sample and bit rate stuff, fades, and then the realm of things I've never thought about like metadata come to mind. Or an answer could be I shouldn't worry too much about all this and just deliver a file at same sample rate/bit depth as it was and hand over the .wav? Just wondering if I can step up my \"mastering\" game in a technical sense (quotations because I will never call myself a real mastering engineer lol)",

I\u2019ve been learning a lot about mixing and mastering over the years, and everywhere I look stresses the importance of keeping the low end centred and being cautious with the sides.\n\nToday, I was analysing a track of mine that just got mastered by a highly skilled and popular UK engineer. I noticed the low end seemed quite wide, with a lot of information on the sides. While it sounds pleasant, I also picked up some non-audible low frequencies in the sides (see the screenshot, red is side signal) , and ofc the waveform looked a bit offset...\n\nI understand this could come from certain production plugins or DSP processing, but I\u2019m wondering - shouldn\u2019t this be addressed in the mastering stage? I know it's not too difficult to fix, but I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on it.\n\nThanks so much! x x",

All very light touches along the way. \n\nSent loud mix to A&R and artist (less than 2db reduction on limiter) but they also approved the pre master in this instance i.e with mix bus on but limiter off. \n\nAlthough the ME has the approved mix already, I\u2019m thinking of sending a version without any clipping and asking to hear 2 versions\u2026\n\nAny thoughts welcomed!",

There is major panning already happening within these tracks\u2026 so I\u2019ve been trialing out imaging tools such as S1 imager, Ozone Imager, T-racks imager, Microshift & Doubler. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s important to be cautious with these plug-ins as they can introduce phasing issues. I\u2019m also finding the stereo sound these plug ins are producing sounds - fake, thin, untasteful and feels as thought is alters the song in negative way. \n\nAt times I thought maybe I\u2019m need more instrumentation within these arrangement to play with panning - but I hear absolutely gorgeous tracks that are simply a vocal and an acoustic guitar that have such a rich deep stereo field (almost as if there were 2 acoustic gtr\u2019s) \n\nI\u2019ve been starting to play with M/S eq and have been having some small wins - but would appreciate and thoughts, views, opinions or direction!\n\nThanks team \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

    "content": "\u2018Riding the distortion\u2019 is such an important thing- when the timing of the distortion is locked within the \u2018groove of the record\u2019 then it is much less noticeable and poking out to our ears and you can go a little harder. Delta plugins can be very beneficial- this goes for clipping and de essing also. Listen to the \u2018delta\u2019 (can be annoying and not so great for your hearing so don\u2019t do it a long time) and get your distortion in rhythm with the record. I guess the best way to describe that is when you get that sort of wobble where you can\u2019t hear everything (duh you\u2019re hearing only the added distortion) but the gaps fill in in your mind and you can follow the timing- then you\u2019ll be happy with the result plus the trade offs induced.",

Sometimes I need to really limit like 5-6dB of gain reduction and that scares me a lot! At the moment I find that clipping a bit more aggressively before the limiter makes for a cleaner more musical result for the majority of the time rather than relying heavily on the limiter. The music feels more connected. So far I find the Pro L2 in All Round mode being the most transparent limiter followed by the balanced mode in ozone maximiser but as always depends on the song. Again thank you Ruairi and everyone else for all the info you share on here! Really appreciate it!",

    "content": "(copy/paste)\n\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively). a dB or two of clipping will help the limiter work less.\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

I did end up using RX and Soothe for this, since the test was a one take with many flaws.\n2. MB did heavy lifting for control\n3. I did a smiley face EQ on it and it felt appropriate, but also because of the lack of mixing on the raw one-take. \n4. ShadowHills 0.5-1.5dB on optical and discrete rebalanced at different levels felt like it added a sense of dimension that wasn't there.\n5. Studer - Added, but again keeping in mind that it added characteristics I need to be careful putting onto a refined mix. This gave it some harmonic life it was missing.\n6. Pro-DS - made some horrendous high end sound more bearable.\n7. Pro-Q3 - some last lil notches for problem frequencies, especially up high and unpleasant.\n8. Oxford Limiter - barely dancing thresh, slower attack, fast rls, inflator 42%, cus I'm spicy.\n\n-\n\nIf anyone reads this and has comments or statements about any of this, please let me know if you'd like to give thoughts here, or if you'd like me to send you the before and after to gauge my decisions relative to your taste, based on the decisions I made for this file.",

A year or so ago after chatting about this very same thing I submitted a couple of test albums for gapless playback tests to Distrokid, the idea being that onece they were on streaming we could do verified tests over how gapless works in different situations.  Unfortunately the masters kept getting rejected by the DSP.  I need to try again and add some musical content in there to fool the bots, but I lost a couple of days going down that rabbit hole.",
