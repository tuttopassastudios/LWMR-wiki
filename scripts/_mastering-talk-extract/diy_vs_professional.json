I've said it before, but he's the most consequential person I've met in my music journey. And a lot of what I've gotten from him he probably doesn't even realize, but he really cares and puts time into the music and people. \n\nA huge inspiration both as a mastering engineer and human. Thanks Ruairi!",

It's resulted in some of my favorite sounding records I've ever been a part of. She respected the mix, but took chances and didn't just hand me back my mix. Out the door they were some of my favorite mixes I've ever done and Heba brought something else to them that I couldn't or wouldn't have thought to. I trust her taste & I asked for her imprint. I think there's a way to do both... you can 100% encourage a mastering engineer to push things further and forward without undercooking a mix... but it definitely requires an alignment of taste and trust.",

Having spent a considerable chunk of time recording an album for & with my best friend -- we asked Eric Valentine to master the record and he said yes. Having worked under for him for a few years at this point, it felt like a bit of a reckoning... having him critically listen to something I had really poured my all into. Needless to say, he treated it as he treated everything... with genuine curiosity and actionability. He sized up the mixes in no time, told me the strengths, the weaknesses, even sent me into the other room to re-print versions slightly quieter, fix this pop here, maybe put the guitar solo up here. He gave it his full 12 hours (what felt like 100 hours to me) and the end product leveled up in so many ways. Granted he is not really a 'mastering engineer', but he approached this little project like he approached everything in his music career, with a deep sense of giving a fuck and knowing that there's no real excuse to not fix the obvious issues in front of you. The album sounded fantastic and it really spoiled me for what a mastering experience could be.",

It was developed with Helmut Erler who was at Dubplates for many years\u2026really amazing dude and friend of mine. \u00a0He's cut some really important techno records. \u00a0I think the visualization of the cutter head and the grooves will start to make sense to a lot of people that are a bit in the dark about cutting and modulation and how program material can really affect how things sound ultimately\u2026also how you process your master esp when it goes to plants that do in house cuts that are a bit on the safe/boring side. \u00a0You can get ahead and provide a master that counteracts some of the wide processing moves they make to avoid distortion at all cost.  Also send your client a ref of what your cut could sound esp when people push back on super long programs that don't translate well https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-simulathe-ref/",

They just want it to be better, and fast.\n\nI\u2019m with Ruairi, there will be a day that AI will be as good or \u201cbetter\u201d than almost all mastering engineers, at least in bringing things to center of bell curve. But @Barbara has it exactly right to me \u2014 mastering is just shades of \u201cdifferent\u201d\u2026we all react emotionally to different stuff\n\nSo I\u2019ve been chewing a lot on the thought of\u2026how can we be singular? And irreplaceable? In the mastering role, it is much more than sonics. It is communication, enthusiasm, taste, vision, patience, challenging ideas when it\u2019s right, being open to new ones\u2026all of it. A trusted and reliable link in the chain that ideally lets the rest of the creative team focus on what they do best.\n\nSo I\u2019m focusing on developing a singular skill set. Part of that is sonics, sure. But there is also so much more that I think we can bring to the table. If we are singular then we matter and can add something to the art. If we just make things brighter and louder, AI is gonna beat us, and in my estimation, should.",

The approaches and mindset I'm using, if you have access to the mix...makes them irrelevant IMO. I'm also sorta opinionated on this though. Like...why worry about making a tiny .3 db cut with .7 Q to clear up the vocal range....when you could just cut the actual elements that are the problem...or just raise the vocal?\n\nAnd almost certainly your monitoring won't let you hear these tiny moves enough to even learn probably. But I suppose there is some value is understanding the subtle balance shifts.\n\nFor me, many people can \"master\" their own track just fine for where they are at. It's not helpful at all for them to learn what a pro mastering engineer is doing day-to-day if they ever are only going to be \"mastering\" their mix. Why? It's like saying it's useful to learn the trumpet if you're ever only going to play piano IMO. Sure, it's still music but almost no skills will actually translate across. \n\nYou can always fix it better on an individual track than on the stereo file.\n\nI also sorta bristle at the what is \"mastering\" convo...we just finish records. That's it. Whatever it takes. Of course there are some broad approaches that will be applicable to everyone, but most of them would be better forgotten by mixers so they can make bolder and more creative moves.\n\nAgain, this is all just in my opinion, perhaps Ruairi is rubbing off on me lol?

Limiting the Mix process into one to three days maximum can also help overthink less. After producing, you\u2019ve heard the song so many times and it will be very easy to start second guessing.\n\nCLA said \u201ca mixer\u2019s greatest weapon is our fresh perspective\u201d. And it\u2019s probably the same for mastering engineers too. Switching modes takes practice, and it can\u2019t be done without practicing it at least in my experience. What helped me personally is mixing less while producing. Not putting too much time into processing individual elements unless I know exactly what I\u2019m doing next. I try not to troubleshoot and figure out why the mix isn\u2019t there yet because the arrangement isn\u2019t done yet. \n\nHow could I possibly make the drums work with vocals if the vocals aren\u2019t there yet?",

Wanted to give a little context--i made my post about perspective mostly from the standpoint of understanding that a master does also need to have objectivity. My main motive with that post was mostly stressing the importance of getting an additional set of ears on it when possible, rather than just using the mix engineer or producer to master the project--not necessarily when budget doesn't allow the expense, but rather when the undervaluing of how a good master can serve the project prevents people from hiring an actual mastering engineer/third set of ears. My statement was kinda broad, with the intention to get attention and start conversations! also why it was prefaced as a hot take. Ruairi is absolutely right though, restraint and objectivity is the most important; I think i just didn't touch on that because hopefully, in theory, if you hire a mastering engineer, they know this and practice this. The post itself was strong-worded & also pretty nuanced but I just wanted to be clear to my mastering fellows what point I was intending to make!",

Almost without exception (and I've heard the A/Bs) these types tend to have bad taste.\n\nI want the most musical people closest to the record doing it. The ones with the vision in their veins. It's better for the song. Sometimes we need to do it mastering and I will not hesitate to do so if it's pulling that way. But just listening to a lot of music the ones that come in and you can tell were built through the level and processing close to an end product, and the decisions based on that, on balance speak much more to what they are. Obviously this doesn't go for everything. Broad observation.",

Not all Mix engineers are created equal and neither are mastering engineers.\n\nAlways listen to the Limited version before reaching to the Non-Limited mix because sometimes it sounds good. I have one client that doesn\u2019t listen to his \u201climited mixes\u201d and the client approves that version. So the situation is basically fucked and he has to trust me in what I do",

    "content": "...so, the short answer jack is yes , the wide q eq moves are definitely advantageous and applicable outside of the mastering stage (for my workflow)....very much so. I think in a way , the broad eq is sort of like a painter taking a few steps back from the canvas having been working up close on a detailed brushstroke (which I\u2019d suggest for example is like a surgical eq move in a mix or saturating a sound at the production stage etc).....\u201dstepping back\u201d and listening not just to The minutiae but the overall tone i think is a discipline that is potentially easy to forget in mix mode ......and in a sense this is how the broad EQ is serving me . I find the eq points ruairi shared work v well at the group bus stage also......for light touches\n\nWith regards to whether I\u2019m only mastering . No, currently my most common paid work comes from local / independent artists in my network I\u2019ve built mostly from my local community outwards through word of mouth. This is primarily in the rnb/trap/hip-hop genres and for better or worse it appears to have been normalised that when someone wants a mix....what they want is a mixter. I\u2019m with Derek Ali\u2019s Enginears platform and even there they are promoting a free master from us as mixers on the platform.\nPersonally, I\u2019m not against certain mixers mastering as well....but i think this is more genre specific.....and also v much down to the individual. I think you spoke about your arc on here into mastering and others have too. ....i believe there is much to benefit from having professional mastering engineers, with thousands of hours under their belt listening to thousands of tracks in excellent environments......take the final listen and make the final adjustments on a mix..and for me, i consider myself on a career arc towards becoming that .",

At the very most I would let them come back again, say it's not the right fit and suggest someone I know to be a good fit (I've done this before). But always with the art and their vision first, if I truly don't understand it.\n\nThat said -- I did get really close to walking on a recent project, we were way down a rabbit hole, I think I legitimately did 15 masters. And we were caught up on dither, comparing to pink noise, etc. It was wild. We got it across the line - but I went way out of what would be constituted by us as what the \"mastering role\" should say, because the music was great and I thought the artist could understand my perspective. And I think it actually hit, to refocus on the art and feeling. \n\nIt's a fine line. Sometimes I get the impression that I do step out of what is supposed to be said by mastering engineers -- but people seem to connect with that on my side. \n\nAlso if things are going that way I will just stream it to them -- often they are looking for control or are having a hard time making decisions -- something I see in this new crop of record makers who only have ever worked in a DAW. Hard to know without actually knowing the humans\n\nThen again, many many times I get a note and it's great and insightful and I love it",

I gather that you're more of a producer/mixer who is trying to learn about 2-buss processing because you think that's how to make a record punchy.\n\nWhile 2-buss compression can give you a little punch and impact, you're going to get 90% of your mix's punch through good balance, arrangement, and sound selection. You've got way more control over the impact of your mix by addressing these things.

Or think more deeply about where your time is best spent?\n\nI ask because I\u2019m a super intuitive-type when I master, but I like to devote very focused some time to rendering my tools to deep knowledge \u201cavailable\u201d in that intuitive flow. Probably on the @Rollmottle tip. But my science brain craves the technical understanding. \n\nThere is only so much time in our lives and I\u2019m curious if you think about how you time is best spent \u2014 mastering vs working on very technical things that I would argue offer no value to the actual artistic mastering process (minus having a good listen environment).\n\nTrying to tie this back to the \u201cmakes a difference\u201d vs \u201cmatters\u201d thing\u2026I think it\u2019s great that there is so much enthusiasm for deep dives (ala @Zack Hames ) on here but I can\u2019t help but think there would be little to no actionable info for most of us in what you two discuss! Sometimes I wonder if reading these threads gives me a false sense of accomplishment\u2026like I now understand something that will never matter for me (and I could have just mastered a song instead)\n\nAs always, there is a balance and I\u2019m trying to find my own\u2026you two are just doing both the mastering and acoustics at such a high level I had to ask!",

    "content": "Folks, I have a question for the group. Would love to get a mastering engineers perspective. I'm curious what is the rationale behind masters clipping output converters and leaving in true peaks that exceed 0dBFS? I get that clipping converters can sound cool / desirable, but why not achieve the clipping you want and then print a final master under zero? Why risk a consumer product crapping out during playback and adding potential distortion and why totally disregard pretty much every DSP's recommendation that true peaks not exceed -1 for the encoding process? I'm noticing that a ton of major label releases are peaking above zero with loudness normalization turned off on Spotify.",

I know some people in here have said they\u2019d never edit or tune what they were given to mix. There was a time that\u2019s what I spent the majority of my time doing because it was unlistenable until I did. (Happens less and less now \ud83d\ude42 ) #\nI mastered a track recently, the vocal reverb was so whack. They didn\u2019t EQ the reverb at all, it was insanely sibilant just in the reverb, etc. you guys know what I\u2019m talking about. The artist mixed it themself and they\u2019re NOT a mixer, so I kindly prodded and got her to EQ it out. She was thankful and it made it significantly better. \n\nAlso, I did use compression on the bus on that master - but I would never expect a mastering engineer to put that on my mix because I\u2019m compressing my mix already.  \n\nMixing pop, mixing well produced tracks from seasoned folks who make decisions well before the mixer is involved, is way different than mixing a local bands home recorded ep. Both need totally different perspectives and tools and focuses.\n\nThis got derailed\u2026point is, my view on mastering\u2019s role has changed dramatically since listening to LWMR. I hope I never have to \u201cmaster\u201d my own own mixes again because  I think it\u2019s fundamentally, in some ways, not even truly mastering.",

A mastering engineer I've never worked with before just delivered separate ones (-9 lufs streaming and -5 lufs digital) which I've never seen before and doesn't fill me with the largest amount of confidence - the feeling of the record changes a bit when it's more / less slammed and I feel a bit weird about the idea of two different feeling versions of one record existing in the world. Is there a technical advantage to the separate digital masters approach?",

I've never been asked for it and I'm trying to figure out if it's actually necessary and a thing or if it was just the previous engineer not knowing what's going on in the real world.\n\nI have successfully conveyed the idea that one master for everything is the right way to go, which is great. She's very open and receptive! But I do not know about the radio thing...and trying to guess at whatever the heck, in Ruairi's words, \"multiband fuckery\" is going on at a radio station seems hard.

I\u2019m looking to build a relationship with a mastering engineer and it would be well worth it for me to pay for a few masters myself, in lieu of any actual client, in order to find a mastering engineer that I like.\n\nThe mixes sent will likely be from my work on these live sessions. It\u2019s contractually fine for me to send this material for mastering, but nobody is asking for it and therefore none of the mastered material will be released.\n\ntl;dr I want to pay professionals for services but I\u2019m worried that the context is weird.

My work history leaves me unable to recommend a mastering engineer to clients when they ask, and I'm looking to change that.\n\nThe radio recordings go like this:\n\n1. Record artist performing live\n2. Edit and mix for broadcast\n3. Sessions gets broadcast. This is the primary \"release\" of the material\n4. Copies of lossless mixes get sent to artist after broadcast. They do with them what they like, including the possibility of release. My involvement here amounts to no more than a credit.\n\nI mention these radio recordings because they represent the bulk of my recent work, and they happen within a fixed process with no consideration for mastering. I started this job without a working relationship with a ME, and the scope of these sessions don't enable me to ever send my work to mastering engineers. Nobody is paying for it basically. I'd love to though!\n\nTo answer your question @Nomograph Mastering , the material sent for mastering would have already reached all of its expected stages of release. I would only be hiring a mastering engineer to work on it so I may hear their work. The mastering is for me, not the radio station or the artist - it just so happens that these live session mixes are the most frequent and current projects I work on.\n\nIt's a weird situation and that's why I ask the question. I'd just like to be able to recommend a ME to future enquiring clients, and seeing as I have no recent history with any mastering engineer, hiring them to work on the material I have seemed like the best way to get to know their work.\n\nWhew.

I'm just trying to understand why limiters seem to fall apart so quickly specifically w/pianos.)",

It's hardly relevant but I'd like to share it as it's public forum and I'm curious if other people have gone through similar experiences. \nI said to client I could master the record, they said they had read online that the mixer should never master the record and to get a different mastering engineer. I said sure, but I would be happy to give them a test master to compare against the master from the engineer. Sent it off to mastering with the mix, test master and stems for stem mastering. Mastering engineer came back and had *completely changed the character of the record*. Did not sound like the mix I had done and definitely didn't sound like the test master I had done (which was mainly a louder version of the mix). Fine if it doesn't sound like the test master, but not fine if it didn't sound like the mix. We must have sent it back to this guy 3 times and every time it returned the same wildly different character. I told artist let me have another go at the mastering, they agreed and I did another master. All was good until the client brought it into their car and apparently there was something really wrong with the master... To this day I still don't know what exactly was wrong, I tested and tested and did absolutely everything I could to eliminate the problem the artist was talking about, but I couldn't hear the problem they were talking about and every time I changed stuff and sent it back to them to test, the main issue at hand was still there. In the end, they went with the mastering engineer's master. I didn't care that they went with someone else, I cared that my mix work was undone and I went above and beyond to try and repair it and it was all for nothing. Kick in the teeth is that it wasn't really that great a record either and I did far too much work for something I should have declined to work on in the first place.",

I thought maybe they knew something I didn\u2019t.\n\nSo I tried it. I put a gain plugin before my limiter and pushed the limiter with it. The results? It sounds awful. All the punch and width is gone. Change back to using the limiter\u2019s threshold, sounds great.\n\nAny technical reason for this? I was using the Kilohearts Gain plugin in to Ozone Maximizer, but I would be hard pressed if it was one of those plugins at fault. Maybe the threshold of the limiter has an internal signal flow that changes its behavior as opposed to gain coming in to it or something? Maybe this workflow makes better sense in Sequoia for the Sterling engineers for some reason?",

Is there a sort of checklist that I could have in terms of making sure the master file I deliver goes through a similar QC process as a pro master would? Things like dithering, sample and bit rate stuff, fades, and then the realm of things I've never thought about like metadata come to mind. Or an answer could be I shouldn't worry too much about all this and just deliver a file at same sample rate/bit depth as it was and hand over the .wav?

I suspect this may be where the learning opportunity lies...\n\nI think what matters to me is that 1) the piece is presented in the best way possible to maximise its impact or essence 2) the piece is listenable and that impact is not lost in a wide range of environments / contexts (i was tempted to say \"it translates well\" but I think that's a subtly different thing) 3) the client is happy with the result, and feel confident releasing their art, feeling good about it, feeling it's the best version of what it could be.\n\nI think it's point 3 that gives me pause. You can count my paying mastering clients on one hand, so I'm as \"beginner level\" as it gets, but that said, when i talk to those clients, they share with me that they want a mastering engineer to ensure that their music is going to \"sound right on streaming platforms and translate well to lots of systems\". There's a lot of FUD about loudness normalisation, LUFS, etc. I don't think it's a huge leap to feel that we should also be thinking about common playback devices such as airpods, and bluetooth speakers. For clients who aren't seasoned mixers or record makers, I wonder how they would feel if they listened to their mastered record on a bluetooth speaker and heard that whole parts had practically vanished. Of course I'm also sensitive to not wanting to introduce doubt in their minds unnecessarily.",

The digital mastering engineer is the same as the cutting engineer. Artists were not bypassed in getting the vinyl cut approved. They listened to and signed off on both. \n\n2. The digital and cutting engineer were working closely together. \n\nNow, a lot of these artists were not making music that required massive amounts of limiting to sound the way they do. \n\nThat said, I disagree. Vinyl is already changing the sound so radically that if sonic faithfulness to the digital master is required - why make vinyl? A record will NEVER sound like the digital original or even the tape master for that matter. No two lathes sound anything alike, and the differences can be astonishing. I have heard a lathe amp turn a wretched sounding track into a brilliant one. And vice versa. Vinyl is an unfaithful medium. If you don't care about the cut's sound that's fine. Submit whatever is submitted for the digital master and let the pressing house sort it out. Why even bother with a proper 3rd party cutting engineer at that point?",
