I typically reduce the limiting amount around 2dB, sometimes more sometimes less. I\u2019ll also re balance clipper and limiter relationships\n\n2) Don\u2019t do any pre-emptive processing with the exceptions perhaps of paying a little extra care if it\u2019s a project with heavy sibilance. Don\u2019t mono the bass, don\u2019t change the EQ etc \n\n3) Make a single WAV file of each side, and a set of timing notes that show where each track starts and the length so the cutting engineer can place the track banding / markers\n\n4) I like to highlight anomalies that may present a challenge for cutter but it\u2019s not necessary",

It was developed with Helmut Erler who was at Dubplates for many years\u2026really amazing dude and friend of mine. \u00a0He's cut some really important techno records. \u00a0I think the visualization of the cutter head and the grooves will start to make sense to a lot of people that are a bit in the dark about cutting and modulation and how program material can really affect how things sound ultimately\u2026also how you process your master esp when it goes to plants that do in house cuts that are a bit on the safe/boring side. \u00a0You can get ahead and provide a master that counteracts some of the wide processing moves they make to avoid distortion at all cost.  Also send your client a ref of what your cut could sound esp when people push back on super long programs that don't translate well https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-simulathe-ref/",

If there was a certain vibe to the record, try and go with someone that had experience with that aesthetic and let them lean into 'their' sound. Over the years it became somewhat exhausting to have to go back and forth with MEs doing revisions and tweaking. There was a certain point where I felt I had to QC every revision that came back and it was just too much with multiple projects swimming around. When I started using Chris @ Sterling, that process just went away. Things came back enhanced, never modified... if that makes sense. Plus I never had any issues with clicks and pops... so I could literally just do a quick check (maybe verse/chorus) to make sure things add up and move on -- trust the process. Same w/ using @Nomograph Mastering... it ends up being less work for me, not more -- and the end product ends up sounding better while retaining the original intent of the mixes.",

    "content": "Below I am sharing something that I send to my mastering clients when they inquire about targeting LUFS levels for streaming services. I hope it is helpful to some readers. Discussion is welcome.\n\n\nRegarding mastering to streaming LUFS loudness normalization targets, i.e. -14 LUFS - I do not recommend trying to do that. I know it's discussed all over the web, but in reality very few people actually do it. To test this, try turning loudness matching off in Spotify settings, then check out the tracks listed under \"New Releases\" and see if you can find material that's not mastered to modern loudness for it's genre. You will probably find little to none. Here's why people aren't doing it:\n\n1 - In the real world, loudness normalization is not always engaged. For example, Spotify Web Player and Spotify apps integrated into third-party devices (such as speakers and TVs) do not have loudness normalization. YouTube is normalized but \"YouTube Music\" is not normalized. Apple Music's web player is not normalized. With normalization off, your -14 LUFS track will sound much softer than most other tracks.\n\n2- Even with loudness normalization turned on, many people have reported that their -14 LUFS masters sound quieter than other tracks in playlists.\n\n3 - Some streaming services have different loudness targets (Apple's is -16) and there's no guarantee they won't change their loudness targets again in the future. For example, Spotify lowered their loudness target by 3dB in 2017, then in 2021 they switched measurement from ReplayGain to LUFS. Also, in Spotify Premium app settings you find 3 different loudness settings; \"Quiet, Normal, and Loud\". Now AES is recommending that all music streaming services switch to -16 LUFS. It's a moving target. \n\n4 - Some people suggest making multiple masters at different levels. But digital aggregators (CD Baby, etc.) generally do not allow more than one version of each song, so you'd have to make separate paid submissions.",

I've recently started including 44/24's. i've always discouraged submitting anything other than 44/16 because who knows what some of these services are doing with SRC and dither, but i think with the advent of high res and lossless delivery, you are well-advised to submit the higher bit-rate files nowadays. all that said, with something like 44/24 you are probably pretty safe from getting your shit munched down-funnel.",

I recommend all my clients to hire them because the results have been always super good. But\u2026 one day I got a PDF from the client asking if my masters had been through that PDF specifics.

    "content": "Yes -- definitely save as montage every single time I ship a file, and then before I do any adjusting on a revision. So previous pass is kept as is.\n\nIt depends on how I name it. Like you said, any system that makes sense to you and is granular enough to track all files shipped will work. These days, with albums very often coming in slow dripped as singles, and massive amounts of changes last minute (it's how the game is), it pays to be very organized. I'll even go so far as to name things descriptively if it makes sense for the project (brighter, heavier, etc etc), or by date, whatever. \n\nBut the real work of mastering every day is very messy, and you have to have a good way to track everything.\n\nGranted, I'm more of a \"creative\" type from my experience than a very in the weeds structured type (neither right or wrong), so my system works for me. I can always get exactly back to what was shipped, montage open within under a minute for sure which helps creative flow.\n\nMy 2 cents -- I'd totally do away with the initial rough master. Think of it from the client side. Rough master says \"hey give me validation\" and puts the onus on them to listen. Every interaction incurs a cost. Sending just the master, exactly as you hear it and owning it, works so much better in my experience (believe me, I've been the guy to send options before back in the day). Ruairi is exactly right on this",

How much do they trust you, how much do you want to continue working with them, etc. @Rollmottle is always great with his words, and that kind of approach is key to get the conversation started. I also find that having an alternative master for the artist to listen to is helpful. Rather than explaining what\u2019s wrong, just being able to say \u201cI think this direction might serve the music better\u2026\u201d \n\nThat being said, if the artist is asking their friend to master it, you might end up being the most professional person involved in the record.

Now, I\u2019m lucky to be so busy with mastering that I don\u2019t even have time to consider other work. And while I could probably still pull off a passable mix, my friends who do it every day would do a much better job. I think there\u2019s immense value in eventually specializing and putting all your energy into one place.\n\nHaving said that, everyone\u2019s path looks different, and there\u2019s no single right way to get where you want to go. For me, specializing and putting all my energy into mastering was the right move, but I know plenty of people who thrive wearing multiple hats.

We'll never switch to AAC due to bandwidth issues.\n\nThe \"constant upgrades\" are often due to the ever changing landscape of browsers. Each client is often on a different browser, different device and different internet connection. It's our job to understand that landscape and push fixes to ensure we get perfect playback across all environments. \n\nThat's part of the reason we built the iOS app, to be able to provide a more consistent playback experience when browsers themselves are the limiting factor, and so that clients can listen offline to take the network out of the equation. But I totally understand that you can't really ask a client to install another app on their iPhone. \n\nTo my knowledge, Samply is still the only platform that lets clients stream full resolution lossless AND gapless track transitions in a browser.

A few thoughts\n\nNot everyone has loudness normalization turned on. It also doesn\u2019t exist on Smart TVs, many streaming web interfaces etc\n\nThe different services all have different level norm targets (and even different settings within just Spotify) - and they change pretty regularly\n\nIn terms of absolute level when normalization is active what matters is arrangement (dense mixes sound quieter than sparse/spacious mixes), EQ (bright/mid range forward mixes sound louder than dark) and distortion levels (clipped/distorted mixes feel perceptually louder than clean). If I make a master a dB louder in mastering using just limiting for example, they just turn it down a dB more when it\u2019s level normed.\n\nSo what does all of this mean? It means that every song has sweet spot where the EQ/tone, the arrangement and the overall clipping/limiting level works best and communicates the intent. That\u2019s what we aim for.\n\nYou can use a site like loudnesspenalty.com to see what will happen but it will just drive you crazy and the only real way to meaningfully alter the result is to change the arrangement/mix or overall EQ a lot. On release day you can find 1000 records that are louder than yours if you want to.\n\nIf being the loudest is the intent - game everything listed above and you can \u201cwin\u201d.

    "content": "Yeah. I immediately change the frequency graph to *Log* or *Extended Log*. This allows me to see the low-end and midrange with more resolution. It's the same reason most EQ graphs keep the octaves evenly spaced so that 50% of your freq graph isn't 10kHz and up. It gives you more resolution for the notes in the lower octaves.\n\nAs for FFT size or window shape, I never change it, but as Ruairi alluded to it requires an understanding of the physical limitations of FFT's. \n\nIn short if you want very fine frequency information displayed you can change the window size and lose rhythmic information. But it you want very precise rhythmic visualization you have to sacrifice how much frequency information the FFT can display. So the ideal setting ultimately depends on what problem you're trying to solve.",

Ideally your workflow and back end systems would make this a very small lift. Unless it\u2019s something wild, better to have the client have a wonderful experience, keep their momentum, don\u2019t introduce doubt, double down on their confidence, etc.\n\nI\u2019m assuming it would be something like making sure the levels and overall tone are right if you\u2019ve already mastered them all and they are in the same ballpark, but feel free to tell me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAlso \u201ccohesion\u201d is massively overrated to me anyway, I much prefer a creatively interesting and varied listening experience if the music calls for it as long as we are not having wild level or EQ swings or something (sometimes it calls for cohesion to have the best listening experience IMO, so know that too!). \n\nI\u2019ve had multiple instances where an artist\u2019s new \u201csingle\u201d release includes their several past singles I\u2019ve mastered too. They didn\u2019t tell me they were doing that, and I mastered each totally alone, just based on the song and their vision. And to be honest those collections sounded totally fine every time as a group of singles, mastered alone.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019d definitely politely educate them on what it exactly entails so it doesn\u2019t happen again in future, and so they can take it into account creatively.\n\nBut of course where you are in your career, the relationship with this client, etc all plays into this.

    "content": "First of all Edsel, congrats!! Sounds like you crushed it. Warms my heart to see others in here succeeding.\n\nI\u2019m extremely green (just going on like 5 months mastering full time), and was sort of interested that you thought it was perhaps not cool to use the limited ref? I\u2019m getting similar stuff (limited, heated ref, unlimited), and honestly I find I\u2019m using the ref certainly some of the time and working from there. Sometimes there is just magic there, and while my chain may be \u201cbetter\u201d it\u2019s also just different, especially when I can tell people are mixing into that ref chain.\n\nI guess I just mention because going into my new \u201crole\u201d in mastering I made a very conscious decision to only operate on a binary: is what I\u2019m doing making the record feel better to me or not? Is it becoming more of what it wants to be?\n\nAnd throw out any notions of what I felt I \u201cshould\u201d be doing.\n\nIn some ways being very new has given me a great creative armor, I am not afraid to lose and therefore do not feel bad or something if the ref is a better starting point than my chain or if I am doing very little.\n\nI am fascinated in your perspective as someone who is a pros pro but in between where I am and where Ruairi is.\n\nI\u2019ll land the plane here\u2026it seems like the fact that this song was \u201cabove your pay grade\u201d sort of played into the fact that you were maybe seeking Ruairi\u2019s approval to use that limited ref?\n\nDo you think you would have approached using the ref any differently if you knew it was just some kid in a bedroom, or would you have still trusted that it was still the move to use it?\n\nI ask myself this stuff a lot, since I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m always doing exactly what is right for the song, but of course many factors play into our decision making (insecurity, relationships, fear of losing a project, etc)\n\nSorry for the rant, but your story was very inspiring!

Hoping he hasn't trademarked this one so the Discord doesn't get shut down.\n\n\n\n\"Remember the early Elton John records? Remember how his piano shimmered? At mediasound we loved that sound so a lot of us were always playing around with getting different versions of it. No lacquered hammers, no Dolby A off, just a combination of compression and EQ.\n\n\nI only recorded Luther's voice, may he rest in peace, on that song along with \"searching\" and then mixed both. Luther was on a whole other level of singers. He walked into that session and listened to the song in the control room once, then he walked out into the studio with the lyric sheet in his hand. What you hear on\"Glow of Love\" and \"searching\" is his first fun down reading the lyrics from a yellow pad. No punches.\n\n\nThe piano sound you\u2019re referring to is probably the same one that I did for Vandross on the \u201cNever too much\u201d song.\n\n\nOk, this is how you do it.\n\n1. First insert an LA3A or LA2A (depending on the version of sound you\u2019re going after) across the stereo piano tracks. The LA2A is good if the song is slow and the chords are quarter notes. The LA3A is good if the chords are faster with a harder attack like in \u201cnever too much\u201d. Bang those meters and \n2. out of the compressor go into a couple of pultecs and push up..way up the 3 or 5 k on the low end and the 8 or 10 k on the high end. Don\u2019t be safe. \n3. Now go to the desk EQ and start clearing out some of the muddiness and EQ up the remaining mids so that it just shimmers like a baby. \n4. When it\u2019s done right, you can hear the harmonics riding up during each sustain.  \n5. I remember hearing that song on the radio and man that piano was making me feel good all over. Sounds pretty simple when you know how to do it right?\u201d",

Thanks for sharing.\n\nAnother thing I think about a lot, and I believe posted about it before, was an old Bill Evans documentary where he touched on how to learn to improvise/etc...and his main principle was to essentially \"play at your level\", and accept that's where you are. So instead of playing a bunch of fast notes...play only a few very slowly and intentionally...his theory was that it will sound and feel the most authentic that way.\n\nIn a mastering context, I think about just taking the song was far as I can at my current moment...like I may note be a Ruairi or Dale or Rollmottle but I can still do things that I think sound good and add to the record. It may not be as far as I can go in a year, or 10 but it still can read very musical and cared-for! But it takes a lot of...shall we say self-reflection to accept that I'm not where I can be yet and live with it you know? Instead of trying to force something on a record that doesn't need it",

The good news is that the audio itself is still always being streamed losslessly.\n\nThis doesn't excuse the bug at all and I'm very sorry for the pain it caused. Our job is to keep things simple and accurate for your clients and when mistakes like this happen we know that erodes trust for your clients, and by extension erodes your trust in Samply. Despite the bug, your masters should still have been playing back correctly (lossless & gapless) for all clients.\n\nIf you have evidence that our assessment here is incorrect, please please send that over and we will bust our ass to correct anything that may be working incorrectly.

There\u2019s a whole school of the online mastering discourse that holds this belief and it strikes me as disconnected from the mainstream. It presupposes that loudness comes at significant cost to the material in some way \u2014 which way? Emotional? technical? artistic?  Or that all material should be dynamic\u2026which is, of course, not true. \n\nAs Noah was getting at, some of my most vivid memories of live music both as a performer and as an audience member exist BECAUSE they were loud as fuck. Loud is in our DNA. There\u2019s a visceral, tactile and emotional response to loud. Even if we\u2019re talking about a \u201cquiet\u201d or more dynamic record, people will turn it up so they can feel it.\n\nGood loud is within everybody\u2019s grasp in 2025 and I love being able to make loud records louder, with minimal, if any, trade off. If I can deliver an appropriately loud master given the material with little compromise, I will. That\u2019s exciting to me and not a bummer. It's what the vast majority of my clients are looking for. Of course if the record doesn\u2019t call for loud, we don\u2019t make it loud. But, I also don\u2019t think excessive loudness is what\u2019s making or breaking records.",

You have discussed why this is good for the clients experience, but I have noticed how my subconscious attitude for the project changes the few times people have insisted paying in front of the project. \n\nUsually I have a huge motivation on moving a project along super quick and making sure to have a fast turnaround - the faster I respond and make them happy about their music = payday, both in positive feedback and \ud83d\udcb5. But there is really no pressure since I have only received files, they haven\u2019t payed me anything. If the client has payed, I either find myself slacking bc it\u2019s already payed OR stressing out big time bc they have payed and I feel a huge pressure on not f*cking up the project and the smooth creative process goes out the window. My brain works better with a carrot then a stick.\n\nThat\u2019s why I have found I do my best and fastest work when invoicing after masters are approved. I am sure other ME\u2019s brains are wired the other way around.",

When printing the album I use the print-time to casually listen to the album from start to finish to catch stuff I would like to adjust (one track lacks impact ect.). Final limiter is always post analog print and I do not print hot. This makes revisions a breeze 97% of the time, unless there is a new mix of course. Also easy to back of a limiter without reprinting if the client wants more dynamics or I want a more dynamic vinyl pre-master. Hope that made sense.",

Once in the voice channel you can activate a camera if you want to.\n\nGotta remember Discord was initially used primarily as a gaming chat app, so the voice channels are set up in a way that makes it easy for people to pop in and out.  The voice channels are sort of like ever-ready voice calls that clients can jump in and out of it immediately so it makes it great for more unstructured conversation.

Of course I do my best to take the vision of the project into consideration, where it is and the potential it has to go further...but it truly and always comes down to just asking myself \"am I connecting emotionally, and do I like the music better as a listener than before\".\n\nOn some level, we can only be what we are, if that makes sense. I can't master as well as I will be able to in a year, 5 years, 10 years. But I just do the best I can, when I feel connected to the record, it's done.\n\nHave had quite a bit of stuff come recently, had to get it out quick. I also specifically practice doing very short masters (not for a client, just practice)...I find this lets me know where I am. Almost always just keeping on tweaking hurts the music, our objectivity, etc. Some of my favorite ones I've done were done in 10 minutes. And not because I rushed, because I just trusted my intuition. And I hope this doesn't come off as arrogant/etc but I deeply believe in my taste and what I like. I never question it. Luckily, people seem to agree with me so far. But unless you have that trust in yourself and are willing to put it on the line, not sure how anyone could really do high, high level work like Ruairi is (feel free to push back on this).\n\nAnd sometimes, a \"bold move\" is to barely do anything. That takes a lot of trust and belief too.\n\n My issues almost always lie in me not being able to quite get it where I want to go. That's hard. But never about where it should go, if that makes sense. Sometimes I may be wrong, or people disagree creatively, which is great! That's information we can use to bring their vision to life more accurately.\n\nOne of my favorite coach speak/quote things from my football days was \"you don't rise to the occasion, you default to your level of training\". I find it's true. \n\nThoughts on how you approach that?",

I was more hybrid earlier on during my conversion period and now mostly all in due to my workflow and client time demands.\n\nI definitely feel like i\u2019m chasing Refs with the same plugins used by mixers and producers sometimes and don\u2019t feel creative but that\u2019s the game lately. I really feel this is the main problem. I\u2019m not really happy when i\u2019m pushed in that direction.\nWith almost everyone having the same plugins it\u2019s very apparent that most masters in a shootout sound the same now. No surprises there.\n\nIs Analog Better?\n\nI recently bought a Terry Audio CEQ to try and change my sound and it definitely works. It has an amazing sound and color that cannot be found in most plugins. That being said it doesn\u2019t work for me all the time.\nMany of the projects i work on are so loud and pushed anything run through analog gear loses the \u201cglue\u201d that is in the digital mix.\nI also just got a Sontec MES-432D9D from Make Believe Studios.\nIt actually sounds like the real thing to me. It has a much different vibe when using it. I find myself using different frequencies from other EQs.\nIs That Better? I\u2019m not sure yet but getting good results when i use both of these tools.\n\nI think the most important part of my setup is that I\u2019m very familiar with my plugins and know when to use different ones when necessary (its also so easier to try another one if you\u2019re not sure obviously)\nI\u2019m constantly trying to stay fresh and not mail it in.\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s an actual answer for this but i hope i answered some of your question or at least validated our situation.\n\nChris\"*",

I think you kind of answered your own questions. $10 is crazy low and not sustainable for anyone, I'm not sure what that other engineer could actually be doing besides blasting tracks through Ozone. Since you are already cold emailing, I think your time could be better sent searching out artists who are in need of an ME and get your full rate there. If you took the $10/gigs, they would eventually be dropped anyways as more full rate gigs started coming in. If it were me, I would rather work the word of mouth game through the artists you are DMing and hopefully more gigs stream in that way via other artists, producers, or mixers. Put in the work now creating meaningful relationships and connections that can exponentially grow instead of the label path which seems like a dead end. I've been cold DMing artists with a freebie first song, I just started this month and it's a big numbers game, so I can't say for certain how it will go. But, because of the freebie I gave them, I am now talking with these different artists about mastering an album, an EP, and several singles at full rate. This is rhetorical, but how many cheap label songs would you need to master in order to get the same amount of money? So in short, if it were me, I would spend my time elsewhere creating more meaningful relationships with much more room to grow.",

Because I wasn't there in the room, I don't know the limitations of the session. It's not helpful to try and impose my harmonic vocabulary or arrangement preferences on someone else's, and the sessions are never unmixable even when I don't think they come from an ideal starting point.

At the very most I would let them come back again, say it's not the right fit and suggest someone I know to be a good fit (I've done this before). But always with the art and their vision first, if I truly don't understand it.\n\nThat said -- I did get really close to walking on a recent project, we were way down a rabbit hole, I think I legitimately did 15 masters. And we were caught up on dither, comparing to pink noise, etc. It was wild. We got it across the line - but I went way out of what would be constituted by us as what the \"mastering role\" should say, because the music was great and I thought the artist could understand my perspective. And I think it actually hit, to refocus on the art and feeling. \n\nIt's a fine line. Sometimes I get the impression that I do step out of what is supposed to be said by mastering engineers -- but people seem to connect with that on my side. \n\nAlso if things are going that way I will just stream it to them -- often they are looking for control or are having a hard time making decisions -- something I see in this new crop of record makers who only have ever worked in a DAW. Hard to know without actually knowing the humans\n\nThen again, many many times I get a note and it's great and insightful and I love it",

It is my job to be an affirming creative collaborator and keep my portion of the relay race that is record-making on track. I've found the more I am open to the weird stuff the more I find cool ways to make things sound better. If I really don't understand something a 5min phone call with the artist or producer solves that problem. If things end up not to my taste, fine. If things truly seem to be going off the rails (like the sudden barrage of notes @thegreatcarsoni encountered) I'll often ask for more info: \"hey, I see you've got lots of new notes, I'd love to chat and make sure I'm nailing things for you on my end.\" More often then not that'll result in a pleasent and productive discussion. Sometimes I end up doing the notes, sometimes the concerned party ends up nixing most or all of the new notes. My whole ethos as a mixer (and occasional producer or ME) is to let the artists and producers into my world and process. No secrets, lots of sharing what I'm doing and why when appropriate. People are not hiring me to mix, they're hiring me to be a creative team member. Being open to \"crazy\" notes and ideas is part of that sometimes.",

I work in the highest format provided to me but always send 44.1/16 as the final delivery. Over time, I\u2019ve found this approach minimizes client confusion and ensures smooth communication.\n\nThere was a period when I sent both 24-bit and 16-bit files and included a detailed explanation in the email about their differences and applications. However, instead of clarifying things, it often led to more questions, leaving clients uncertain about what to release and where. It became clear that peace of mind is more valuable than technical details for most clients.\n\nThat\u2019s why I stick with 44.1/16\u2014it\u2019s still widely accepted and even remains the standard for many major labels. In fact, I do an annual check-in with labels of all sizes\u2014independent and major\u2014to confirm if delivery standards have evolved. As of this today for this year.. they have said.. just keep sending what you send. \n\nThis is based on my experience and isn\u2019t meant as legal or financial advice\u2014just a method that works for me and my clients to keep things straightforward and stress-free LOLLLLL",

    "content": "Surely there's something to learn from the history though yes? Cutting is what the profession of mastering used to be and digital is not wholly removed. We can certainly take learnings from our history while embracing modern methods. Cutting good vinyl is also respect for the folks who work on it and the artists who want their music conveyed appropriately across mediums. \n\nI have no problem making stuff massively loud with zero limiting and small amounts of soft clipping, and still retaining tons of transient peaks. I prefer this sound to heavy limiting at the master stage where the program material audibly hits the limiter and the soundstage and sense of headroom collapses. To me, the limiter is optional, but I do understand many use it before they acquire the skills to work without it. \n\nThat said, I also was taught that in genres where its appropriate (Imagine Dragons, Hip hop, EDM, etc.) that those sounds should go in at the production or mixing stage. At the mastering stage I was taught to do no harm, and only to enhance what was present. In my work pushing more than a few dB into a limiter to affect the groove of a piece does not track with my understanding of doing as little to change the sound as possible. But of course, it all depends on the project. My clients who make very mainstream pop/youtube music don't particularly care if I radically editorialize as long as it sounds good and serves the tune. \n\nThere's also something to be said for music which needs to be quiet. Not all music should be loudenated to within an inch of its life. Not all music needs quiet and intimacy. I think of we hold the pursuit of \"the program material's individual requirements to be king\" we cannot then also dismiss vinyl as unimportant or say that one MUST always do things a particular way.",

I mentioned there's an option we could try.  .5dB vocal lift with additional .3dB 1.7k wide lift in those sections got it there.  He's a happy camper.",

    "content": "Only had one experience with abbey road online mastering, but it was a LONG time ago. The master i got back was trash. But the client sent it to them and did all the communication so i have no idea what the process was like. Also again, many many years ago so could have been an isolated incedent. I'd rather pay a mid level guy in my town that i can easily communicate with than do an online thing like that though.  I think when we did it, we never even got to find out the name of the engineer that did it. EDIT: As Cian said, sterling is also just uploading through an online portal and dealing with assistants, but, at least you know who is mastering it. They also generally only include one revision in the per song mastering rate at sterling, so its similar that way. If you dont have a label budget, it can be limiting if its not quite right the first time back, way less flexible than going with someone who might be able to acommodate a bit more back and forth when needed.",

It's often a balancing act \"Well, I can't really do on my end that but I can try XYZ to see if that hits what you're feeling\" -- even if I know a thing is technically possible. Sometimes that means a song goes to V7 that was done on V1. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think these folks just want to know they are being heard and I'm not certain there's anything you or I could do better that would solve this other than accounting for more time for projects with stakeholders prone to this (aside from raising their rates or dropping them as clients of course).",

I have learned the more songs often the \"longer\" it takes to make them all play nice with each other especially in 2025 where I might get a record that is from the label with 3 mixers, 13 songs over 3 years of single release then ep, then remixed, then all put together to be \"the album\". I  honestly can never copy and paste settings either 99% of the time from song to song which I think some clients assume, well you dial one in so the rest should be faster. Sometimes the record is super consistent and it is \"faster\" in theory, but due dillgence is still needed on every song start finish, then if you get the track list or sequence and its a little complicated or they got high energy next to ballads next to high energy etc. You have to manage how that flows as well. SO I find singles are \"easy\" ...EP are little harder..... LP to get out the door, with each song reaching its potential while feeling cohesive often takes more \"time\". So no discounts. I will sometimes discount the total budget if the people are good, music is good and the budget is not my normal rate.

BUT i ran numbers of time vs money etc about 9 years ago.. and the cost of running alts and the benefit of a flat rate vs explaining to clients cost, and nickel and dime or they come back later and then i had to charge etc. Its way easier for me to run it all right awawy and just call it done. You can make plentyyyyy of money by doing this method and you remove friction and the potential fear in their mind that theres always an upcharge. For me this has played out massively over 14 years of client loyalty and peace of mind. Its a time suck  .. i usuall do invoices during this time... ive done assistance etc.. over they years but then its me paying the assistant to run alts which  is not a high level skill and managing them on some level. Long term you can for sure make a killing just doing it yourself and also the client seems to really enjoy knowing its a turn key process. The  main thing for ths is making sure your charging a high enough rate to start with which isnt really \"hard\" .... its just a matter of presenting the value and sticking to your rate. Customer service is worth a LOT and especially with referrals. Ill get gigs just because of the above method. Time yourslef how long it takes to do the alts, work the numbers and youll find if your charging a \"pro\" rate.. its not a  problem. Now of course if you dont want to do it.. thats a different conversation and fine, get an assistant.

I know some houses do this. \n\nI am certain that no one here could blind detect a 16 vs 24 bit master more than 50 % of the time. \n\nThe form looks fine, but it is def a \"step\" for your clients, which is always something to weigh. \n\nI find delivering masters at the same resolution I got the mix in to be very friction free, and if they need a 16 bit they ask for it. \n\nAnother thought, I typically work on indie stuff, but when I have had some smaller labels ask for stuff they always want 16/44. I belive it is considered by most to be the \"most compatible\" file type.",

The issue is that the publicist is asking for things that she isn't fully able to be very clear about (I think maybe because she is somewhat inexperienced and doesn't know what it is she actually needs), and it's starting to approach a level in which I'm providing a lot of stuff for no charge--even though at the moment, I'm swamped and starting to get a little stressed trying to squeeze other projects in and also trying to wrap this up and get the client everything he needs. For some background, I had to re-make the DDPs because the client changed some song title information after I had already done the due diligence of confirming with him that all of the information was correct. now, his publicist, who had originally requested embedded MP3s with all of the album/artist/sequence info and album art for the album and also five singles, is now saying she meant to say she needed wavs.",

I imagine everyone like I was when I was a teenager, music obsessed and wanting to make something they're proud of.   I worked hard, saved my money, make sure our band was rehearsed, and finally was able to go to a 'real' studio, which for me in the 90's was a rare opportunity and big deal.  The engineer was so dismissive of us (and did a shit job with a shit attitude) but I have to thank him as I knew it was deeply wrong and it put me on the path to do it for a living.   Similar thing happened in many mastering situations, sometimes with big name ME's.  It just never mde sense to me to treat clients like that.",

I think this is a purely technical topic...my master doesn't sound any different with TP or not if you just de-clip the occasional one (and I don't make creative decisions based on it at all). Was just wondering if it could induce some sort of distortion somewhere along the line in the codecs. Using TP on a limiter is a different story.\n\nObviously very few clients will be \"checking\" this but I think it's my job to understand the trade-offs or if it matters at all when things go to streaming. Saw an IG live by Dale Becker and he seemed to imply that if there were TP in files they might get turned down more on streaming. I don't think it's a great thing to chase how masters will translate to any one platform but it's important to understand the marketplace the music is going to!",

And overdelivering for people while maintaining a healthy long-term balance in my life\n\nOn a technical side it\u2019s taking specific time to dive deep on topics (currently EQ) in a very specific and targeted way for learning but keeping my mastering time very free and intuitive. Only working with things I really understand and come second nature. \n\nFrom a philosophical side it\u2019s continually making sure my decision making is based in curiosity and respect for the music rather than fear or concern with how my work is judged\n\nWould love to hear what others are feeling since we have such a wide range of engineers here!",

Was wondering if I should share with the artist first, get their thoughts, and then share mine with the artist / corroborate before sending notes back to the ME or discuss it first with the ME, get a version that could be the final, and then share with artist? I don't know if this artist has ever had a song mastered before and they have pretty much deferred all engineering elements of this project to me. Probably thinking about it too much but I want to instill confidence in this artist and in them believing they have a finished product. Hard to do that when I don't believe it's there yet.

I want a way to do it all in one project and restart the track numbering on each alt version.\n\nDoes anyone know if that\u2019s possible, or just how are you handling it?\n\nI ask because I do know how to do it multiple ways but I\u2019d like to be more efficient for revisions, etc\u2026say if someone wants to change a fade I\u2019m not going through 4 montages to get all the alts too",

They had another studio also master the album (they hired me because that studio didn\u2019t have availability but ended up having availability). Completely crushed, bottom end gone etc. They came back to me and said they liked what the other studio did but didn\u2019t like certain things which the other studio couldn\u2019t fix (too much distortion and compression\u2026) so they wanted me to do something along those lines but better\u2026 was a complete mess and after a long (and productive) meeting to discuss the direction they wanted for the next revision they emailed saying they didn\u2019t want another revision from me and wouldn\u2019t be paying for the album (which at that point I had mastered from scratch 3 times)",

I master records in the independent scene from Wales and usually the bands/labels don't have budget to hire a specialist vinyl cut.  I've never been happy with this and wonder whether this plugin may help optimise for vinyl, the other variable is that most of these records get manufactured via a broker and usually end up being cut at GZ Media in Czechia, I've had good and fairly frequently bad experiences with them so am keen to improve this side of my offering.  If anyone is using Simulathe I would love to get your feedback on it.  I know @hebakadry and @Bonati12461 mentioned it but I think you were using it in conjunction with your actual lathes.",

I\u2019ve taken it about as far as I can with RX but there\u2019s massive sections where the drums are edited so poorly that beyond normal momentary bad cross fade pop noises, the transients are audibly blurred and doing the whoosh thing. do you guys and gals ever just straight up tell a client that it\u2019s not ready or do you do the best you can with the source material? I don\u2019t think he will be able to zoom in enough with critical ears to hear/fix this stuff, but I don\u2019t want to go back to the artist and tell them that I need to charge more to basically crack open the multitrack/do somebody else\u2019s dirty work.",

Is it bad form to hire a ME to work on material that will never see a release?\n\nThe majority of my current work is recording/mixing live sessions for a radio station, an endeavor that has no budget or consideration for the mastering stage. I\u2019m looking to build a relationship with a mastering engineer and it would be well worth it for me to pay for a few masters myself, in lieu of any actual client, in order to find a mastering engineer that I like.\n\nThe mixes sent will likely be from my work on these live sessions. It\u2019s contractually fine for me to send this material for mastering, but nobody is asking for it and therefore none of the mastered material will be released.\n\ntl;dr I want to pay professionals for services but I\u2019m worried that the context is weird. Am I good?",

    "content": "I freelance outside of my radio job. These projects are more likely to make it to mastering. My work history leaves me unable to recommend a mastering engineer to clients when they ask, and I'm looking to change that.\n\nThe radio recordings go like this:\n\n1. Record artist performing live\n2. Edit and mix for broadcast\n3. Sessions gets broadcast. This is the primary \"release\" of the material\n4. Copies of lossless mixes get sent to artist after broadcast. They do with them what they like, including the possibility of release. My involvement here amounts to no more than a credit.\n\nI mention these radio recordings because they represent the bulk of my recent work, and they happen within a fixed process with no consideration for mastering. I started this job without a working relationship with a ME, and the scope of these sessions don't enable me to ever send my work to mastering engineers. Nobody is paying for it basically. I'd love to though!\n\nTo answer your question @Nomograph Mastering , the material sent for mastering would have already reached all of its expected stages of release. I would only be hiring a mastering engineer to work on it so I may hear their work. The mastering is for me, not the radio station or the artist - it just so happens that these live session mixes are the most frequent and current projects I work on.\n\nIt's a weird situation and that's why I ask the question. I'd just like to be able to recommend a ME to future enquiring clients, and seeing as I have no recent history with any mastering engineer, hiring them to work on the material I have seemed like the best way to get to know their work.\n\nWhew. Appreciate your time. That was really hard to chew through for some reason.",

I said sure, but I would be happy to give them a test master to compare against the master from the engineer. Sent it off to mastering with the mix, test master and stems for stem mastering. Mastering engineer came back and had *completely changed the character of the record*. Did not sound like the mix I had done and definitely didn't sound like the test master I had done (which was mainly a louder version of the mix). Fine if it doesn't sound like the test master, but not fine if it didn't sound like the mix. We must have sent it back to this guy 3 times and every time it returned the same wildly different character. I told artist let me have another go at the mastering, they agreed and I did another master. All was good until the client brought it into their car and apparently there was something really wrong with the master... To this day I still don't know what exactly was wrong, I tested and tested and did absolutely everything I could to eliminate the problem the artist was talking about, but I couldn't hear the problem they were talking about and every time I changed stuff and sent it back to them to test, the main issue at hand was still there. In the end, they went with the mastering engineer's master. I didn't care that they went with someone else, I cared that my mix work was undone and I went above and beyond to try and repair it and it was all for nothing. Kick in the teeth is that it wasn't really that great a record either and I did far too much work for something I should have declined to work on in the first place.",

Both times I served the project, delivered the stems. Both times I did not love the masters.",

I don\u2019t know that it would really be that awkward of a conversation to talk it out. They might not realize how much work it is for you and it will be good for you guys to realign. \n\nI too will work with anybody who has the clarity to communicate the intent of the record no matter producer, mixer or artist. Sometimes the mixer is closest to the sonic vision of the record and may also have the relationship with the artist and producer more than me, so I definitely see the value in Cian\u2019s approach too and one that is pretty common for me over here. I\u2019m sure that evolves at different levels.",

They then provide a list of UPC codes and some \u201cinternal coding\u201d which look to be ISRC codes \ud83e\udd14 \n\nI\u2019m fine upsampling from 48/24 (although there\u2019s no obvious benefit to this imo) but I\u2019ve only dealt with ISRC\u2019s in the context of a DDP. Are you able to embed ISRC codes to individual audio files like this? If so, how would I best go about doing this? Or should I just deliver the high res WAVs and advise them to embed the ISRC codes via their distributor?\n\nAppreciate any feedback!",

But I\u2019ve had it happen quite a few times where I have a close relationship with a mixer and thought it could be an oversight for reasons specific to each instance (not just generally seeing a peak of 0)\u2014 turns out when the non-lim 32 bit print is sent there are sure enough overs in there.\n\nTypically i see it happen when they are going into limiters hot in the REF, obviously when they print non-lim there are overs. Talking big overs, +4db or whatever\n\nBUT \u2014 honestly it doesn\u2019t really sound \u201cclipped\u201d in the 24bit non-lim print \u2014 I\u2019m assuming the overs are just recalibrated to zero but somehow this doesn\u2019t sound bad? Of course, if I get the 32bit I find I can make it sound just as loud but \u201cbetter\u201d with the full waveform represented in the 32bit file.\n\nIt\u2019s an easy fix \u2014 just get a 32 bit print without a limiter (if I can get in touch with who is handling that, which isn\u2019t always the case).\n\nI think (?) I understand what\u2019s happening \u2014 DAWs operate at 64 or 32 and can handle the overs fine in the session, but upon render at 24bit they get chopped (not sure about wording).\n\nTotally fine \u2014 I can and have handled it no problem, just a curiosity on what others are seeing, if I\u2019m even on the mark about this and how (or if) you are handling it.",

Two songs ago he got onto experimenting with AI mastering which he thankfully moved off of because the tracks sounded horrible. \nThis last track we did, he had another ME offer to do a test master on it. I was down and just asked if I could hear it before it goes out. Fast forward, he uploads the track and the first time I hear about it was through socials. So I asked if he went with that ME and how it sounded and got told no, his drummer mate ended up mastering the track. \nSo I just got quite frustrated as him and I have quite an open relationship. Mainly because it didn\u2019t sound that great. There was a bunch of true peak overs which thankfully I\u2019m less stressed about after speaking to Jack\nSo I\u2019m struggling to see if this is ego or just that I don\u2019t trust this person who mastered the track.",

All easy.\n\nSo problem solved now \u2014 but still curious about if people have delivered projects with multiple sample rates as an exercise in learning\n\n@Nick Stetina it\u2019s going to streaming but my default is to deliver the native sample rate the mixes come in at. Most distros take it almost anything, though I\u2019ve seen more requests recently for 44k 16bit for some of these smaller, newer distros. \n\nApple will play it (in ALAC) at what\u2019s delivered, yeah Spotify will covert but it\u2019s making an OGG anyway (which we can check in RX) \u2014 so my preference (and I\u2019m open to have my mind changed) is to deliver what it was created and mixed at for a lot of reasons. That seems to do great for me so far! Is there a reason you only do 44 (if I\u2019m understanding that right?)",

    "content": "+ @Rollmottle , you know what, poor word choice on my part by saying \u201cundoing\u201d, haha. What I really meant was in the event of a revision request. \n\nFor example, I worked on a song this week with a jazz quartet instrumentation and a singer with a bit of a lisp. Super dynamic mix, the upright bass had a lot of wild moments that needed to be reigned in. Always gonna follow my gut on the to first pass, but also recognize the singer\u2019s potential sensitivity to how their lisp comes across on the recording. I just opted to focus on the instrumentals on the first pass in RX, save the file, duplicate it, then work from that and focus on vocals. They approved on the first pass, but if I had to go back to the drawing board on the vocals, for example, I did not want to have to go through every note plucked on the upright bass again and would be thankful to have that \u2018RX_INST\u2019 file on hand.\n\nWhich I guess brings up another workflow question: are you splitting focus when in RX and doing multiple passes, or just play through once addressing whatever it is you hear as you go?",

All is well until the majority of labels I contact all get mastered by the same engineer who charges \u00a310 a track, which I think is such a low rate and seems like a race to the bottom.\n\nIs it worth it at my stage to take on these lower paying gigs? \n\nMy thoughts are:\n- It could be damaging to the clients I already work with that pay my full rate.\n- These bottom clients will never be full rate if they've had a \u00a310 deal for years\n- It gets more work in for me = my name gets spread out a bit more. But, these labels never seem to credit the mastering engineer.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What would you do?",

Gone full time into mastering at the start of this month (using the money I've saved for gear as rent money essentially buying me time to grow the buisness) so money wise is pretty scary.\n\nDefinitely going to pivot what I'm doing and head down the artist/producer/mixer route, you're completely right.

This is for music that I write, produce, record, and mix all myself, so by the time a mix is done I'm usually way too close to it and have lost all sense of perspective. I imagine if I was a fully fledged mix engineer mixing tracks for producers/artists I'd feel less of a need to do this. Not sure if that perspective is helpful... but maybe?",

I'm not disagreeing with any of the above, but I'm struggling a little to reconcile it with my experience as an artist who has sent mixes off for mastering, asked for notes, and genuinely wanted to be told if there was something like \"the kick seems 6db too loud\" so that I reevaluate, see if I missed something, think about why that happened, and maybe send a new version of my mix. It feels strange to me to have this perspective as a client (i.e. this is the service I hope to get and am paying for) and then on the other side of the relationship say something like \"don't provide this information, even though they asked for it, just do the best master you can\". There's a mismatch there that _could_ be interpreted as the ME not providing the service the client wants. Perhaps the contextual difference here is that when I was sending these mixes to mastering, it was not my \"career\", I didn't have a team, or deadlines, or a label involved. Or perhaps I'm just misunderstanding?",

Is there a sort of checklist that I could have in terms of making sure the master file I deliver goes through a similar QC process as a pro master would? Things like dithering, sample and bit rate stuff, fades, and then the realm of things I've never thought about like metadata come to mind. Or an answer could be I shouldn't worry too much about all this and just deliver a file at same sample rate/bit depth as it was and hand over the .wav?

    "content": "Hi all, wanted to see if there are any recs here for a great EDM ME, and any specs on what to send them master chain-wise as someone who is not typically involved in that scene. Long story short, I have a new client (EDM vocalist/DJ) who I\u2019ve known for a while and have a good relationship with, so it made sense for me to do the prod and mix on her new song even though it\u2019s not my usual bag. We were interested, however, in testing out the difference that a top-tier ME with and EDM specialization would make, especially since I\u2019m a bit uncomfortable with the idea of dialing things in for a club soundsystem (I do a lot of Kpop pitches, where I assume most of the listening happens on airpods straight from the Gmail window). Any names or sonic recommendations would be appreciated!",

There is major panning already happening within these tracks\u2026 so I\u2019ve been trialing out imaging tools such as S1 imager, Ozone Imager, T-racks imager, Microshift & Doubler. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s important to be cautious with these plug-ins as they can introduce phasing issues. I\u2019m also finding the stereo sound these plug ins are producing sounds - fake, thin, untasteful and feels as thought is alters the song in negative way. \n\nAt times I thought maybe I\u2019m need more instrumentation within these arrangement to play with panning - but I hear absolutely gorgeous tracks that are simply a vocal and an acoustic guitar that have such a rich deep stereo field (almost as if there were 2 acoustic gtr\u2019s) \n\nI\u2019ve been starting to play with M/S eq and have been having some small wins - but would appreciate and thoughts, views, opinions or direction!\n\nThanks team \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Sometimes I work on albums where the mixes are done in a very short time, and other times it takes longer, so the focus changes over time (which is totally natural). Right now, what I\u2019m doing is setting up a mastering session with all the latest mixes (with limiting applied), doing the track list, and listening to the differences between them\u2014things like timbre, balance, loudness, etc. I make notes of what I hear, then go back to the mix sessions to make small tweaks. After that, I export everything without the final clipping/limiting on the tracks, so I can apply those in the final mastering session and then master the album. Anyone with a different approach is more than welcome to share, as right now I\u2019m wrapping up a lot of albums I\u2019ve worked on throughout the year, and I want to stay as sharp as possible to give them a proper finish.",

This mindset makes me really nervous, like if they want it brighter and the snare to snap a little more and stuff, that should be handled in the mix. I don't want to do endless revisions, but if you tell me after 4 rounds of revisions there's additional stuff you want changed, I'd rather just do it. Why do a stem master?

On one side, it gives them an early indication of direction and an early opportunity to give feedback, which some may enjoy. On the other, it could communicate less confidence on the part of the mastering engineer, and I feel like a big part of what we are trying to do here is make them feel confident about releasing the record.

Would you have let this go out like this? How do you approach it if you get a mix like this?

I suspect this may be where the learning opportunity lies...\n\nI think what matters to me is that 1) the piece is presented in the best way possible to maximise its impact or essence 2) the piece is listenable and that impact is not lost in a wide range of environments / contexts (i was tempted to say \"it translates well\" but I think that's a subtly different thing) 3) the client is happy with the result, and feel confident releasing their art, feeling good about it, feeling it's the best version of what it could be.\n\nI think it's point 3 that gives me pause. You can count my paying mastering clients on one hand, so I'm as \"beginner level\" as it gets, but that said, when i talk to those clients, they share with me that they want a mastering engineer to ensure that their music is going to \"sound right on streaming platforms and translate well to lots of systems\". There's a lot of FUD about loudness normalisation, LUFS, etc. I don't think it's a huge leap to feel that we should also be thinking about common playback devices such as airpods, and bluetooth speakers. For clients who aren't seasoned mixers or record makers, I wonder how they would feel if they listened to their mastered record on a bluetooth speaker and heard that whole parts had practically vanished. Of course I'm also sensitive to not wanting to introduce doubt in their minds unnecessarily.",

AND sometimes they just end up having me remaster it from the mix as well and that replaces the original single that already came out on the DSP... the work usually speaks for itself. BUTTTTTT if i get the previous masters and then the next 8 mixes that need mastered and they go ...just do the next 8. The conversation is honest. Its ... those previous 3 are going to sound dull and less full next to the 8. So we have a choice, I try to dull down the potential of the 8 to fit those 3 or you let me take a run at those 3 to match the new 8. Sometimes they.. go.. lets hear 1... then they go.. OKAY ya.. sometimes they go.. NEVER thought about that... good point .....we want it all to be the best it can be so do what you need to do. The confusing part is later in the credits .. when i have to send muso the proof i did it and not the other ME who clamied it.... lol turns out the labels dont go back and tell other ME they didnt get the final master ....also i have mastered things i dont have credit on which sucks.. but politics... but i know the \"right\" people know who did what so thats all that matters to me. keep getting hired and paid haha. thats what i care about lol. All the above is said much more elegantly and you are right bedside manner is key.",

A good friend of mine is one of the top Lathe techs in North America, and my understanding from him and the cutting engineers I know and have worked with, is that digital clipping can make life hard for lathes. I'm not saying you cannot do it or arguing the merits of digital limiting or anything like that, that's an entirely separate topic. It is however a technical fact that lathes do not get along well with digital clipping and it will make the cutting engineers job harder and generally result in a record which does not sound as dynamic. If that is an acceptable compromise then so be it. As you say, if the artist/client is happy and the bills are paid, then all is well (mostly \ud83d\ude09)",

If you heard the music you would have NEVER guessed this twist in the story. \n@hebakadry is correct that highs are a bigger deal. I guess the point is every project has unique characteristics that require the person cutting it to sometimes make decisions that blur technical and artistic ones together. This is partly why I have a policy of cutting only masters I\u2019ve done.

When they\u2019re in my environment, I find it\u2019s easier to have conversations on the record, and what Im feeling about it and what they feel about it . Even a phone conversation, not even about the track necessarily, but just shooting the shit and them getting to know you, helps a TON with these types of situations when come up. \nHuman connection is everything in the service industry. A lot of people are too busy to talk. And in some cases for legitimate reasons. My clients appreciate that they can reach me, text me etc without dealing with middlemen. When a client feels like they\u2019re sent something off and aren\u2019t getting what they expect out of communication, and THEN getting back something they don\u2019t like. THATS where things go left! \n\nI don\u2019t get fired that often, but like a breakup in a way, I can predict in the way we are communicating pretty much 90 percent of the time that it\u2019s not gonna work out for whatever reason",

Sometimes I need to really limit like 5-6dB of gain reduction and that scares me a lot! At the moment I find that clipping a bit more aggressively before the limiter makes for a cleaner more musical result for the majority of the time rather than relying heavily on the limiter. The music feels more connected. So far I find the Pro L2 in All Round mode being the most transparent limiter followed by the balanced mode in ozone maximiser but as always depends on the song. Again thank you Ruairi and everyone else for all the info you share on here! Really appreciate it!",

I realize this may be a bit of a moving target depending on the engineer and how busy they choose to let themselves be, as well as the clients timeframe; but as I gradually continue to get busier myself, I'm trying to sus out how far I should be comfortable booking out (ie: 2 weeks, a month, etc.) before potential clients might get antsy.",

But I'm recognizing that this kind of approach also ends up digging holes into my pay-to-time-spent-working-on-a-project ratio.

But many of you are saying that I should mostly treat this like emotional support, rather than technical support, in most circumstances. \n\nIt makes me think of how I've learned to turn off my own technically minded 'problem-solving' approach to life issues when I'm trying to support my wife - who just gets annoyed when I try to brainstorm solutions to her problems, and actually just wants to be emotionally supported. I find it super hard to do this, and I have to consciously hold my tongue and say and do all sorts of things to provide her with what she wants, rather than what I would naturally do.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg",

Always preface your statement with \u2018unless we actually go through the process of doing it again, we won\u2019t really know! It may, it may not.  That\u2019s really the truth. And lay out the state of play as it is. \u201cIf we were to do it again\u2026lay out all the variables that need to be considered- how the mixbus was constructed for one\u2026and stay out of The business of giving the mixer edicts.",

    "content": "When doing revisions, does anyone save a whole new project file with a version number appended to the end? Wondering if that might help me stay more organized. Currently working on an album where the client wanted to go back to V1 for release, and I swear I kept track of every move I'd made to get to v2, but for some reason I just couldn't get it to sound exactly like V1 again. It's no problem on their end because they just used the file I'd rendered and uploaded to Samply. But now I have a clip in my montage that doesn't match the released version, which I don't like. I ended up dropping the master on a reference track instead.\n\nI think this issue was partially caused because I tend to send an initial rough master too early in the process and they get demo-itis. For some reason I've always wanted to send clients an initial rough master after I've done the quick \"from the gut\" broad strokes, but before I've totally nailed down the nitty gritty stuff, to see if they like the direction I'm headed. And all too often they end up liking the first version.\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking v2 and making it worse on a regular basis? I dunno... \ud83d\ude02",

    "content": "Hey there. The only way it would work is if it's an all new release, with new ISRC and UPC and everything.. but even then Spotify may see that it's a previously released track for this artist and not allow it for Playlist submissions. If you share the same metadata, track lengths, etc etc.. if it all looks the same, it will likely not be available to that artist for play listing at all.\n\nSo PR, MGMT, Label relationships with Apple, Spotify, etc would be the best fail proof approach I think there. Of if they get a distro deal like with Tone Tree or Symphonic who can help bring new life to the release.\n\nJust leaning on the algos and stuff won't do it in this case, I really thing a human working the release relationally is what it would take.",

    "content": "(copy/paste)\n\nAssuming we're talking about fairly typical rock, pop and Hip Hop then this 3 part strategy covers a lot of ground\n\n1) Make sure the EQ is as balanced as you can get it - most of your perceived loudness comes from the arrangement and mid range focus (2k to 8k). Too much low end will sound bad when you limit. Make sure the relationship between 80, 160 and 320 makes sense (think of them a little like fundamental, 1st and 2nd harmonic).\n\n2) Consider shaving snare transients (and maybe kick transients) with a clipper. This spreads that peak energy harmonically across the spectrum, keeping energy, hiding in the noisey nature of snares and lets the limiter work less hard (I like SIR Standardclip - $25, great metering and responds intuitively). a dB or two of clipping will help the limiter work less.\n\n3) Pro-L2 on the settings below is a great start point for clean and predictable limiting, raising input gain until you get the desired level",

The clients got a rec from a friend and they\u2019re stoked on them. But I just take issue with this type of process. It\u2019s extra work on everyone\u2019s part for likely zero gain.",

If anything I try really hard to avoid it or have a long sobering discussion with the client about it if they are really insistent.",

Almost always there\u2019s no mixer involved, almost always I have done a stereo version before and they felt the need to go deeper and almost always it\u2019s with a client I know rather well.",

    "content": "When it\u2019s worked and the client came away super stoked, that makes it all worth it for me.  Lately, most of the stem work I do is with international artists who self mix, where the exchange rate makes it very hard to hire outside mixers, if they\u2019re hard to find for the particular genre they oscillate in.  So even if I wanted to recommend a mixer it\u2019s not really in the cards and I gotta step in and help out.  Which I\u2019m super happy to\u2026when it\u2019s right.",
