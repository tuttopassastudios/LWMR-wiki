    "content": "I have a different angle you could try. I would focus almost all your energy on becoming a better, more truthful, richer lyricist. That's the only place you'll be original because there's only one you. Paradoxically, it's also the way you'll write songs that have a universal appeal because the more personal you get, the more the underlying universal emotions will resonate with people.\n\nTrying to be analytical about melodies and structure and style when writing has never yielded good songs for me or literally anyone I know. All the best songwriters I've met write all their best songs lyrics first.\n\nAlso, when you have something to say, it's surprising how little you pay attention to the melody. The melodies and structural components seem to just come when your heart is already in the story.\n\nThe only other thing I'd say is learn A+ songs. Learn the lyrics completely and learn the story behind them as much as possible. Then learn to sing them the way the original version is sung. That will expand your vocabulary as a vocalist and reinforce great lyrics.\n\nLastly, technology is going to continue to increasingly replace stylistic innovation. Yeah AI blah blah blah, but already drum machines and synth presets and splice and DAWs. The last thing to be replaced will be you personally writing things from your experience. Songs about your deepest insecurities and songs about your pet gerbil both fall into this category. Explore all of it.",

I feel as if bridges don't get enough love. \n\nWhether listening or writing, I think a good bridge can be extremely satisfying because you tend to get a really interesting emotional counterpoint to the rest of the song, and I love the tension that can come out of that contrast.\n\nMaybe I just love tension in general.",

I\u2019ve got some projects that I\u2019ve put many hours into, just to let them sit on a hard drive for years.\n\nCo-writing has helped a lot, and has taken some ideas to places I never would have thought to go. The feeling that you have some moral obligation to your collaborators to finish is motivating. When you\u2019re making art for yourself, it doesn\u2019t benefit from those positive forces of peer pressure, and there\u2019s a lack of constraints and no sense of urgency. \n\nI think making creative decisions is metabolically expensive. It\u2019s easier to defer all decisions, which is why you see DAW-age producers committing to so little until the mix. In the same way you can defer the entire songwriting process, especially if you have someone else\u2019s project or deadline to prioritize over your own.\n\nTo be both the creative mind and the executive finisher is a lot of exhausting context switching. Some options might be to split these responsibilities with someone else, or to dedicate separate time to each task. If someone hires me to print stems or solder a patchbay, the last thing I want to do is engage in creativity. But when I get inspired to write, I don\u2019t want to stop and troubleshoot the plug-in that\u2019s crashing the session.\n\nMaybe like the divergence/convergence approach would be to set aside an hour or three at the end of your day to finish ideas you\u2019ve already got brewing\u2014set a timer and finish a song, or a verse. Or, even better yet, dedicate the *end* of your day to play and experimentation. Then the next morning, hopefully with fresh perspective, get in the mood to tie up loose ends and prepare your next steps. You\u2019ve demonstrated that you\u2019re good at wearing that hat for other artists, so you can do it for your songs, too. Just maybe not while you\u2019re in the creative flow.\n\nI\u2019m not practicing what I preach, just brain-dumping. I definitely don\u2019t have this figured out.",

Unfortunately being in London almost 100% of my work has been remote, I\u2019ve found myself tracking drums, bass, vocals, trumpet etc all using AudioMovers and while it\u2019s great to finish projects I agree with you that it\u2019s way better to do any or all of the above in person.\n\nThat said maybe the cold call/ intro is more like a \u201chey, here is some of my stuff, let\u2019s jump on a zoom call, if you don\u2019t hate me in the first 30 mins come hang at the studio for a day\u201d \n\nThat all said, if anyone on here wants to jump on and do a session hit me up \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks again Matt, even more keen to push forward now!",

    "content": "His stance against slant rhymes seems to be more about being in favor of things fitting very tightly together and having intentionality and form and structure. He and another friend of mine viewed slant rhymes as mostly a product of laziness, as if the writer couldn\u2019t be bothered to find something that truly fit.  \n\nI countered referencing the hook to an Olivia Rodrigo song where every single rhyme is a slant rhyme, which IMO adds to the value of it because she\u2019s trying to express how things don\u2019t quite fit and how the thoughts in her mind are unresolved, and the rhyme scheme should reflect that to create a unified feeling. \n\nThe lyrics are:\n\nYou\u2019ve got me thinking\nThat two plus two equals five \nAnd I\u2019m the love of your life \nCause if rain don\u2019t fall and sun don\u2019t shine \nThen changing you is possible \nNo, Love is never logical \n\nHere she\u2019s searching and grasping. She\u2019s unresolved. She literally uses a metaphor of the math not adding up. Why would we then make the math add up phonetically? It would weaken the effect. \n\nAlan was meh on it. \n\nI also argued that hard rhymes can be like the phonetic equivalent of a classical Haydn V-I movement that has very little color or tension, and that slight rhymes can be like jazz chords and that adding a 7 and a sharp 11 on top of the tonic chord doesn\u2019t mean you \u201cfailed to resolve\u201d. Someone else at the table was like \u201cwell show me a truly great song built on slant rhymes and we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m open to it\u201d and in my head I was like \u201cI thought I just did\u201d but they didn\u2019t love it.",

    "content": "Hmmm. Fun challenge. So both of these songs seem to be pretty heavy on evocative or surrealistic imagery without an obvious central subject (if there is one at all).\n\nHow about this idea: For each section of your song pull up a movie scene that you know or enjoy. Then write down everything you see without explicitly giving away what movie scene it is. Describe everything. Pick out details. Whether their actually represented in the scene or you're just speculating on something that *could* be. Or make up descriptions of the scenario beyond what's actually spelled out:\n\n*Two people casting glances across the room. One doesn't notice*\n*Hard shadows stretched across the floor*\n*Does he have enough cash in his wallet?*\n*Somebody's running late*\n*The room is thick with tension*\n*Someone did the crime*\n\nI dunno. I'm just spitballing, here.\n\nOR start mashing concepts together. Things that don't normally co-exist. You're bound to get some evocative results. Cedric from *The Mars Volta* fits into this mode pretty well. His lyrics are extremely evocative but after all these years I still can't say for sure what they're actually saying. If there's a coherent thought in his songs it's so far obfuscated that you'd never know anyways.",

For example, I can try break down the drums of a song into a  drum pattern, dynamics, feel, and the drum sound (type of drum kit, machine, and processing on it). \n\nBut with lyrics (or language) - it feels more gray to pinpoint how to take a concept and apply it into my own writing. How do you usually break it down?",

Than do all the background vocals. \n\nThen start muting a couple of the melody parts. Find my verses.\n\nRinse repeat the process above. But now I know the story and I just have to find the melody and the thru line narrative.\n\nDepending on how the verses feel running into the chorus. Or short length of track.

As a songwriter I have this toolbox of melodic and harmonic approaches  that I can use to solve any problem when making a song, or to have direction to create another section. But recently I've been noticing that something that makes a huge impact on songs is how the different sections relate to the tempo of the track. I think this might not happen to people who write to a beat, but I think that when you are playing an instrument, tempo is so fluid that some parts of a song might \"feel\" good and others won't (at a same tempo). When all the sections flow well into another in terms of tempo (and probably how that affects to vocal delivery) it sucks you in as a listener and it is way more singable/enjoyable. And now I'm starting to see this as a priority more than which notes of the scale have more weight on the chorus and stuff like that.",

And as you mentioned, high notes can move the energy and accent the rhythm. Lyrical stress patterns could contribute to the accenting and note selections. Weight sometimes means notes that are held longer than the other sometimes the opposite. Contrasts can do a lot though. Range of movement or the range of the pitches themselves, pacing of the rhythm and rests, breaking the patterns/repetition can help with contrast",

    "content": "Couldn't agree more! I think what I was trying to say is that melodic rhythm is very much related to the tempo of the song and the delivery of the singer. And when tempo changes, even if the ratio remains the same, it has a different impact on how it feels. And, sometimes, because you might not be writing to a click, different sections of a song might \"feel\" cohesive at different tempos. And when you sum everything up it just doesn't translate well. And I've had the experience of trying to work around it but ended up noticing that it didn't have to do with the melodic rhythm in each section, but how it relates to the whole song. And now I try to be more aware of it because I think it might be something that is not easily noticeable when you are writing. I don't know if that makes sense (I'm not a native english speaker and therefore I struggle a bit sometimes \ud83d\ude06 ).",

But to me, having that manic performance really struck home the idea that you\u2019re experiencing a blur of the night just to lead up to an extremely quiet post chorus to make it feel like you woke up alone. Both of those themes also reference the lyrics of course. Idk this doesn\u2019t make that much sense without context, but that\u2019s really been on my mind. I feel like I\u2019m broken for not making everything extremely simple but I like to think that even average listeners feel more from the performance and energy of things changing than just having something that\u2019s super predictable.

Melodically I tend to be like @Rob Domos and make everything as simple and predictable as possible, but sometimes it feels too easy and there is nothing that stands out. Lately my approach has been to use lyrics and chords to spice things up. For example, If I've got an idea for a lyric that I like, most times the metrics of it won't be incredibly predictable, and when I come up with a melody for it will be a bit more interesting than if I started out with the melody. Maybe then, for another section of the song I'll start with the melody and it'll be simpler. I think contrast is key. It really is an interesting topic!",

    "content": "Interesting. We\u2019re basically taking the refrain of a Beatles song and repeating it over and over\u2026 almost like a mantra. Can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s a cover exactly. It\u2019s the same melody but I think because the structure is so different it\u2019s more of an interpolation. Is there an easy way to get permission or do I have to call Paul?\nAlso would be down to just submit it as a cover and relinquish publishing, but if it\u2019s truly not a cover I could see that resulting in a headache\u2026 or is cover just a safer bet overall?",

    "content": "I go off the assumption that this is the only time I'll have this artist focused on this idea, so my priority is always getting a finished lead vocal and some ad libs. Those are the only things that can't be done without the artist there. I'll get the production together as much as it needs to be to get the artist excited about the song. \n\nThe challenge is doing this quickly, without spending unnecessary time going through snares and patches and shit. I find that nearly all of the best songs I've written happen in about an hour long window of excitement. Sometimes you can stretch and get harmonies or punch in some vocals beyond that hour, but the excitement of a great idea is exhausting and it's hard to keep everyone 100% engaged for a long period of time. If I'm on hour 2 of a song and we're still trying to decide if we like a chorus, 100% of the time it's not a good song (in my experience).\n\nA BIG mistake I make (still) is \"oh we have tomorrow we can take a break and come back.\" It's not about being able to get the artist physically back, but getting everyone back into the emotional space. So much of what I need from an artist is the emotional focused to commit 100% to a vocal.",

Nashville folk will often have \"Demo Days\" where a group of Ace players charge a flat fee to perform and record the rhythm section (for instance, could be anything the song needs). They might record 5-10 tracks in a day. I'm sure some have done more. These \"demo day tracks\" are used by songwriters to then pitch their track to recording artists, labels, anyone.  There's also a whole army of producers ready to help songwriters demo-up...  where the songwriter pays a producer to turnkey the track.  Sometimes it's one guy playing everything or a few remote players all chipping in under the producers direction.  \n\nAnd...  these are viewed as a \"very basic demo\" in the eyes of industry vets. A really good \"one take\" by great players with high quality equipment recording the basic tracks is a strong demo but not fully produced. Happens all the time, but the producer (and their team) gets paid by the songwriter (or their team) to produce the track.",

The biggest unlock for me was to write an entire song\u2019s lyrics first, sometimes preceded with some journaling and/or research on the topic so I have real, meaningful things to draw from. I keep track of syllables etc so it lines up.\n\nOnce the lyrics are done and I\u2019m working on the song, I always end up having to change a lot, usually simplify and take out, but it\u2019s an easy problem when you have excess good lyrical content. As opposed to trying to summon something meaningful to fit a certain melody.\n\nSimple stuff like starting with getting the chorus right has also been super helpful, and keeping production to a minimum before the topline is finished.\n\nExcited to read more people\u2019s hacks here",

This is great.\n\nI made a similar transition from producing bands to doing co-writing sessions as a producer. You can still get hired as a producer or engineer (as I still do), but writing sessions are structured with different expectations and potential outcomes. \n\nWhen you participate in songwriting sessions, you are almost never getting paid up front as an engineer or producer. There are some cases where super rich people will pay for songwriting sessions, or artist with bigger budgets might get their label to pay a studio fee, but this will be a tiny minority of your writing sessions. \n\nPhilosophically, the idea is that you're all creating something together that, if it's good enough, it will be released into the world in someway. But your experimenting and will make many ideas that don't cross that threshold. However, if any of the recordings of these song come out you will still get paid as a producer (/ engineer / mixer / whatever else you do on the final version). If no peace of the recording that you made when the song was written gets used, you will still participate as a songwriter on the copyright.",

    "content": "i guess other forms of art like film or books often do require a lot of structure and thought in order to cohesively convey or execute a vision... even if the vision is fundamentally grounded on a seed of feeling or very specific idea. songs and music are so temporal and intuitive that it doesnt really require that necessarily. \n\nfor better and worse, i tend to have this desire to seek out a 'scientific' nature in things. for me as a fan of films, i can often decipher or intuit the internal logic and intentionality that choreographs lights and angles and framing to create a moving feeling/painting. \n\ni do fully agree that fundamentally the only thing that can create this sense of 'spatial awareness' in a medium, or a sense of dialectic/causality between the subtle and intuitive, creative elements is experience and repetition; but i can't help but seek out knowledge or structure/self critique to my approach.\n\ni think to that end, i should collaborate more with people who are experienced so i can accelerate my own learning if that's what i seek. i find myself always searching for this 'internal' awareness of intentionality, searching for the forces and patterns that make a system or experience exist and change how they do.\n\ni am alwasy looking for this feeling of purpose or understanding of which steps are wanted/needed for me to take what ive created closer to its essence or my original vision. i think people understand this at the level of more technical creative aspects... for example mixing. ultimately the art is still to have a creative vision and executing that, but it's the experience and awareness to have intentionality and wisdom in how to execute that separates raw creativity/talent from a professional level of execution no? I think the same can be applied to more abstract skills like writing/songwriting.\n\ni'm going to commit to writing new material everyday for a month and see what happens!",

    "content": "@Brian Reynolds if it gives context, im speaking from a place of doing zero production. i fully agree with @oaklandmatt about not trying to produce or really do any editing while writing. i primarily work off premade instrumentals, and am frankly only interested in the idea/feeling in front of me. in essence its usually a barely consious continuous freestyle. the best ones at least, come up on their own, i am there to maintain the moment and my presence in it. (and to turn on the recorder lol).\n\nso i was speaking almost entirely from an exclusively songwriting pov, and especially taking idea/demo with appeal/feeling to an actual song structure and consumable product/commodity frankly",
