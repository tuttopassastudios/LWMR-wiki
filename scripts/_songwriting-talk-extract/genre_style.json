    "content": "I always tailor it to the artist in some way. It's a combination of making fresh ideas specifically for them and taking existing ideas that could work (sometimes reworking existing ideas). I never go into a session like an actual blind date where I don't know anything about them.\n\nThe challenge is always do I make something that sounds like what they've done, or do I make something that sounds like where they're going? That's impossible to answer. I've had success in major label POP artist sessions by having a 100 year old piano and specifically not playing tracks. Meaning, you never know if an artist is tired of doing the same shit. Because I have confidence in my skill as a producer, I'm happy to get an A+ ballad because I know I can turn it into whatever production I want. \"In The Name Of Love\" is my most successful example of this. It's an emotional 3 chord piano ballad that was produced into a festival EDM anthem. \n\nI've had the most success being prepared for all options. Mostly because that makes me flexible for what an artist is feeling that day, but also because the more stuff I make, the more music I'm making. If I prep for a session, I'm not working cold. The prep is also like a psychological and creative warm up for me. Prep makes me a better improviser.",

    "content": "the answer largely depends on how A&R driven the project is. sometimes the A&R is really running the show (like with a young pop boy band or something) and sometimes the A&R doesn't really matter and the artist is the whole identity. \n\na VERY loose way i often think about it is like this: if you're going to lean toward the A&R, do it on the production, not the songwriting. every great song i've been a part of writing (and i mean literally 100% of them) have been about capturing an emotional moment or excitement that is happening in the room with the people in the room. if you start thinking about \"what does the A&R want the lyrics to be like?\" you're gonna lose that.",

    "content": "Ok this is one of my favorite topics ever.\n\nHappy to go deeper, but the gist is this: I believe people connect to the underlying emotion, even if their analytical brain isn't reading or understand the lyrics. If the emotion is authentic, the song has a MUCH better chance of connecting. Without that emotion, it is almost impossible. \n\nThe more I write songs, the older I get, the more I work with the greatest songwriters, the more I think that writing an authentic emotion is everything. \n\nA favorite example (I have 100 more, just ask): \n\nParty In The USA. Silly pop song? Or deep truth about the power of music being able to transcend loneliness? Go into the lyric and you realize it's Jessie J writing about her first time coming to Los Angeles: \n\nStepped off the plane at LAX with a dream and a cardigan... am I gonna fit in... everybody looks so famous... I'm feeling homesick, too much pressure and I'm nervous... but then my favorite song comes on the radio... I know I'm gonna be ok... it's a party in the USA\"\n\nTbh I tear up every time I think about this song. Yeah people might not analyze the lyric, but the reason this song will play for the next 50 years (and not the 1mil other simple songs about having a party) is the deep, authentic, universal emotion underlying the record.",

    "content": "You're absolutely right that trying to copy existing hits rarely makes great songs. He's 100% correct on that point.\n\nI'm saying that songwriters often fall into the trap of trying to be \"original.\" They mistakenly think this means they should try to invent new phrases or not use \"generic\" words or try to do something \"interesting\" with the chords. Instead of doing the only original thing that is possible which is tell your story and express your taste. This is actually much more difficult to do because it's incredibly vulnerable.\n\nYou can compose fully original compositions this way. But it's also interesting how much groundbreaking music comes from direct appropriation of existing popular music. \n\nFrom folk music (\"Blowin In The Wind\" is a melody from another song) to hip hop (all of sampling) to producers and DJs making careers from remixes, playing around with current or past hits can also yield incredible new music.",

Unfortunately being in London almost 100% of my work has been remote, I\u2019ve found myself tracking drums, bass, vocals, trumpet etc all using AudioMovers and while it\u2019s great to finish projects I agree with you that it\u2019s way better to do any or all of the above in person.\n\nThat said maybe the cold call/ intro is more like a \u201chey, here is some of my stuff, let\u2019s jump on a zoom call, if you don\u2019t hate me in the first 30 mins come hang at the studio for a day\u201d \n\nThat all said, if anyone on here wants to jump on and do a session hit me up \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks again Matt, even more keen to push forward now!",

His instincts for great melody and rhythm, paired with lyrics that sound good, is unmatched. And I say \"sound good,\" because though I think many of the lyrics of his songs are meaningful (especially with the best lyric co-writers), the choice of words and how they are emphasized and enunciated is what separates him from everyone else. It's like Michael Jackson. \n\nDo some YouTube searching on artists talking about working with Max Martin. You can learn a LOT about writing vocal from him.",

    "content": "Hmm, probably the likes of @BatMeckley and co could speak to this too, but the social skills ain't always the thing.\n\nI've been in rooms with shy/quieter people who are just incredible at what they do. In one case, on a very high profile session, one of the beatmakers literally didn't speak to anyone, ever. He was 19 at the time, literally only opened his mouth to very politely ask me for my email address so he could fly the beat into Pro Tools to cut vocals. But he was making absolute fire, and even though he didn't speak, you could feel a good vibe off him.\n\nI've also been in rooms with *unbelievably* obnoxious characters (the occasional particularly unpleasant example of that LA type we were discussing recently). Utterly repugnant as people, but their work is undeniable.\n\nI know who I prefer to be in a room with (and that really does count for a lot, in my experience), but in the speed dating world of pop music writing that a lot of people go through, you get all sorts. \n\nNot everyone is super charismatic of course, but that's just the world. Either way, 90% of the people I've met at the highest level are really delightful.\n\nAlso, my experience has been that the more accomplished the artist/writer/producer, the more lovely they've been. They've got nothing to prove, and perhaps at a certain level, anyone who's not truly undeniable has already been filtered out of those rooms by being a jerk on the way there.",

Just like the same E major chord could be delivered in different voicings and different style of playing or instruments even. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just about paying attention to it more. I generally pay more attention to music than words by default, so that might be a factor that plays into it. \n\nTechnically- with drums for example, you can use the same tools, try to play it or sequence it with the feel as close to it as possible, and break down what\u2019s on it in terms of processing. If I go further, I can look at how the drums are interacting with the rest of the ensemble. If I just want to rip off the drums from a song, the first three will pretty much get me there. \n\nD\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo is an album I constantly go back to study for the band interaction. Questlove is usually playing straight eighth notes, and very simple pattern. but how open the hihat is, and where he\u2019s hitting, and when he makes the choices to pop the hihat out or kind of let it hide behind the instrumentation is very interesting. Perhaps subtle spontaneous decisions like that isn\u2019t really replicable but I just take it in physically and try to see why he made this by looking at what other instruments are doing. You can just pay attention to how he plays hi hat and go wild playing just the hat along",

In case the implementation provides a better answer, it's two small moments that last 1 second each. \n\nThe answer could easily be that I'm overthinking it, it doesn't matter that much, and that I should trust my instinct here.

Nashville folk will often have \"Demo Days\" where a group of Ace players charge a flat fee to perform and record the rhythm section (for instance, could be anything the song needs). They might record 5-10 tracks in a day. I'm sure some have done more. These \"demo day tracks\" are used by songwriters to then pitch their track to recording artists, labels, anyone.  There's also a whole army of producers ready to help songwriters demo-up...  where the songwriter pays a producer to turnkey the track.  Sometimes it's one guy playing everything or a few remote players all chipping in under the producers direction.  \n\nAnd...  these are viewed as a \"very basic demo\" in the eyes of industry vets. A really good \"one take\" by great players with high quality equipment recording the basic tracks is a strong demo but not fully produced. Happens all the time, but the producer (and their team) gets paid by the songwriter (or their team) to produce the track.",
