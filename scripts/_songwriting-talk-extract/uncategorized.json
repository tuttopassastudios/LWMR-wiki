I really like to hear it direct and actively dislike when I perceive that people are sugarcoating things with me. But something I've realized lately is that I've curbed my own communication directed towards people in favor of a lighter touch and now I often have problems in creative scenarios being super direct with artists when I ought to be.\n\nIn short, I think I've overcorrected.\n\nI think this is a result of having worked with so many artists over the years who wilt under the directness. Not everyone is like that, but I've had enough bad experiences communicating super directly that I've ended up hedging my style in favor of something far more soft.",

So. They hated them lol (they asked if I could give them one more modern and then played me a song I\u2019d worked on a decade ago). Wanted me to write a third, to which we responded \u201cif you want to pay us for a third we\u2019ll squeeze it in but otherwise just revisions on these two\u201d. Meeting ended with an understanding we\u2019d reconvene next day. \n\nNext day, we got the head of the department in. Very well spoken, very complimentary. Said they actually really liked the second song, could we just change the first half entirely. \u201cYou know what, we\u2019ve had a lot of success together sure\u201d. Couple seconds later\u2026 \u201ccould you also maybe totally rewrite the second half\u201d. \n\nWe politely told them to go fuck themselves.",

At worst, you might stand back when you\u2019re done and realise you\u2019ve wound up too close to something. So what? Change it, or start something new.

Still had about 5 tracks to do, though\n\nI took an hour to watch/listen to some concert videos - the watch part was important so I wouldn't be tempted to get distracted on my phone or something - and then got back to work. Got the other 5 done in a few hours.\n\nAll that is to say I think it's good to keep in mind how important it is to consume as much music as you put out, if not more.\n\nAnyone have any good thoughts about this? I'm likening it to the notion of \"information diet\"",

    "content": "i think this reflects a bit more pragmatically my position as well. i defenitely dont make enough or have enough experience to execute how id like... but i do still create, and i think my questions kind of alludes to that gap between ideas and product... which on some level can be critiqued objectively and subjectively. more reason for me to seek outside ears as well as be principled around 'finishing' and not just creating as you say. thanks for your input as well",

    "content": "So I\u2019ve noticed that almost every writer I know (myself included) has said some version of \u201cI need to be writing more,\u201d with an implied \u201cI feel anxious that I\u2019m not doing enough.\u201d I think sometimes that\u2019s a reasonable way to feel, but writing (like all creative endeavors) is something you could technically always be doing, which I think makes it hard to know when you\u2019re doing enough. I think this is specifically relevant to writers trying to pursue writing as a career.\n\nCurious for thoughts on this. I definitely feel that kind of thing come and go, and have a hunch that it has to do with how \u201ctuned in\u201d I\u2019m staying to look for songs and writing material in day to day life. I think that it\u2019s challenging to identify as a writer but feel like you\u2019ve gotten out of the swing of approaching life as a writer or artist.\n\nHave many more thoughts on this but will leave it there for brevity\u2019s sake. Question is basically what is \u201cenough\u201d and why is this such a common anxiety for writers.",
