After some discussion we've instituted a new forum #song-a-week for what will be the first of a weekly songwriting exercise that we now invite you to participate in.\n\nThis is an opportunity to flex your songwriting muscles and share your work with your peers. Every Sunday evening we'll pick a songwriting prompt for the coming week. It may be a theme, or perhaps a popular song that we'll all use as a jumping-off point for inspiration. Participants will have between Monday and Fri of the following week to write and share their song demo. Then we do it all over again the following week.\n\nThe forum is located right beneath #\u270dsongwriting-talk on the channel sidebar. Everyone is welcome to participate starting tomorrow (Monday).",

Much of the time, you won't use any of them on any given day. But good news: they're useful for future days.\n\nI've had all of that prepared and then the artist and I just chat for five hours, then write a song on a piano.\n\nI've had all that prepared and then cut song after song because the artist goes \"what else do you have???\"\n\nAnecdote that might be helpful: I've been in with an artist all week. Me, another producer/writer, and her. The other producer/writer has his rig set up and he also writes topline. We usually bounce back and forth depending on what the song requires. We've all worked together before and we had the whole week blocked out so there's no pressure to perform on day one. But we did three songs on the first day because she just came in firing. The first song she came in with a title and we worked from scratch and knocked it out in an hour. The other producer made the track quick with some existing drum loops he had prepped for her, adding keys and horns as we wrote. Then she asked \"do you have anything to play?\" I played her a track hook I had prepared. She liked it and we powered through that one in another hour. Then we broke for lunch. We caught up. As we were finishing she mentioned this one kinda stupid and sassy idea she tried to bring into another session but the producers didn't like it. So we wrote that one and it was fire. I tapped out a tempo as she rapped the hook idea and just make a skeleton beat on the fly.\n\nBeing way over prepared is rarely going to hurt you.",

That's the only place you'll be original because there's only one you. Paradoxically, it's also the way you'll write songs that have a universal appeal because the more personal you get, the more the underlying universal emotions will resonate with people.\n\nTrying to be analytical about melodies and structure and style when writing has never yielded good songs for me or literally anyone I know. All the best songwriters I've met write all their best songs lyrics first.\n\nAlso, when you have something to say, it's surprising how little you pay attention to the melody. The melodies and structural components seem to just come when your heart is already in the story.\n\nThe only other thing I'd say is learn A+ songs. Learn the lyrics completely and learn the story behind them as much as possible. Then learn to sing them the way the original version is sung. That will expand your vocabulary as a vocalist and reinforce great lyrics.\n\nLastly, technology is going to continue to increasingly replace stylistic innovation. Yeah AI blah blah blah, but already drum machines and synth presets and splice and DAWs. The last thing to be replaced will be you personally writing things from your experience. Songs about your deepest insecurities and songs about your pet gerbil both fall into this category. Explore all of it.",

I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks. \n\nI think it's related to several aspects of the morning routine, and they all compound. \n\n*I'm playing music before I'm on my phone, so I'm outputting music before my brain starts reacting.\n\n*doing scales w piano and voice opens up my vocabulary on both instruments and makes me much more comfortable to sing/play ideas when writing\n*doing these to a metronome has improved my timing on all instruments (not just piano and vocal)\n*learning a great song and singing it every morning has massively improved my lyrical writing/ improvisation (probably the hardest part of songwriting) by just reinforcing good *sounding* words.\n*singing and recording the same song every morning for a few days or a week makes me really THINK about vocals and vocal production. How I'm singing the words, how to push certain vowels in a certain part of my voice, etc \n\n@Slow Hand  @Ross Fortune @Will Melones @OJ",

    "content": "Yes exactly! I've found that the best songs are never calculated, they're always just felt as they're being created. They are magical/ incalculable moments. As soon as people start analyzing \u2013 \"is this too generic?\" \"maybe we should have a part like **insert artist**\" \u2013 the songs loses its magic.\n\nBut the paradox is that you can't  just sit around and wait for them to happen. You have to be in motion. So often times building habits and processes (which are calculated) is a great way to keep oneself in the motion of creating things. Piano scales, learning songs, writing a song a day, etc., are just some of the many ways to do this.\n\nAnd the other aspect is also correct. These are skill building exercises that help the quick translation of creative ideas. It's the emotional and psychological side of workflow. Just like technical workflow \u2013 where you want the shortest time between idea an execution \u2013 same goes for writing. If you are constantly writing lyrics and singing melodies and playing instruments, when that emotional magical idea arrives, you can translate it more quickly into lyrics, melody, and music.",

It's a combination of making fresh ideas specifically for them and taking existing ideas that could work (sometimes reworking existing ideas). I never go into a session like an actual blind date where I don't know anything about them.\n\nThe challenge is always do I make something that sounds like what they've done, or do I make something that sounds like where they're going? That's impossible to answer. I've had success in major label POP artist sessions by having a 100 year old piano and specifically not playing tracks. Meaning, you never know if an artist is tired of doing the same shit. Because I have confidence in my skill as a producer, I'm happy to get an A+ ballad because I know I can turn it into whatever production I want. \"In The Name Of Love\" is my most successful example of this. It's an emotional 3 chord piano ballad that was produced into a festival EDM anthem. \n\nI've had the most success being prepared for all options. Mostly because that makes me flexible for what an artist is feeling that day, but also because the more stuff I make, the more music I'm making. If I prep for a session, I'm not working cold. The prep is also like a psychological and creative warm up for me. Prep makes me a better improviser.",

It sounds like they were writing and rewriting it for almost a year and it almost didn't make the album. They also emphasized the amount of time it took to record; Billie mentioned that it took a bunch of days just to figure out the delivery of the first line and at one point Finneas was like \"oh yeah, that 10 second vocal stack tucked way in the background took us 7 hours.\" I feel like we all hear stories of great songs being written and recorded really quickly and at least for myself I sometimes find it frustrating and discouraging when things aren't coming together like that. I think this is partly because I'm comparing myself to a made up notion that all of the best artists/writers/producers are able to consistently finish a great song in a single session. But I guess this video is reminding me that sometimes the quality that makes these people great is their perseverance and willingness to face discomfort and frustration and keep going long enough to finish an idea.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bkjEO_Zj2g&ab_channel=BillieEilish",

    "content": "Depending on the kind of wall that you\u2019re hitting with her, there are a few simple approaches that you can suggest that will get her thinking about the different dimensions of melody and how to play with it:\n\nA) Expansion - How long is the melody? It is a small fragment, or a full sentence? Stretch it out over a longer period of time. Sing it half as fast. Hold certain notes for emphasis.\n\nB) Diminution - Compress parts of the melody into faster runs. Make it shorter. Remove notes. Simplify the melody to its melodic essence.\n\nC) Repetition - Take a fragment of the melody and play it again. And again. And again.\n\nD) Modulation - Take a melodic idea and transpose it to different keys. The first movement of Beethoven\u2019s 5th Symphony is built entirely off of a simple four-note motif. He got a lot of mileage from such a small element.\n\nE) Dynamics - Play with volume or intensity. Encourage her to go from soft to loud, or loud to soft. Accent certain notes for emphasis. This one is really powerful. For inspiration suggest that she try voicing her dynamics like a great horn player might. Get her to clip her notes very short or to make them \u201cbloom\u201d or be soft and round. Make them bark or be breathy.\n\nF) Be Another Instrument - Encourage her to try writing as another instrument with her voice. Sing a bass line. Sing a horn part. Sing percussively like Michael Jackson or James Brown would.\n\nG) Role Playing - Give her a character and a persona to inhabit. Make her sing the same thing as different personalities or people. Pick a melody and then make her sing it in the style of three singers that she\u2019d know.",

If you\u2019re not familiar with his work, he\u2019s 98 years old and has written lyrics for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Aretha Franklin to Quincey Jones to half of the artists your grandma listened to. \n\nAnyways, some good takeaways from last night\u2019s convo:\n\n\u201cWriters these days are more interested in immediate appeal than they are in a great song. They aren\u2019t the same thing. A great song is only a great song if people will want to cover it in 30 years\u201d \n\nHe cares immensely that whatever is being said in a song is worth saying. Does the message have strong intrinsic value?  \n\nHe\u2019s verrrry quick to say he doesn\u2019t like a song.\n\nHe has a strong preference for melody being written before the lyrics, which is particularly interesting consider his career is as a lyric guy. \n\nHe has a strong dislike for slant rhymes. (I disagreed and it turned into a whole family convo about phonetic tension and release)\n\nHe\u2019s still writing every single day without fail. Today he\u2019s writing on an upcoming Pat Metheny record. \n\nHe\u2019s never heard of Drake or Olivia Rodrigo. Mind you his wife was the president of ASCAP for 15 years so this is particularly mind blowing. It shows me how siloed different worlds can be even when they are so similar and near to one another. What wisdom does one silo have on lock that the other is missing? What rules have been taught to us by people in one silo that don\u2019t apply in the silos we ourselves are working in?

I\u2019ve just been writing with friends, using those tracks to get with smaller artists, and pushing from there.\n\nAlso, to add to the cold call grind. There\u2019s a really solid formula I\u2019ve learned in marketing to get higher open rates, and my brother who\u2019s launching a clothing brand just found out a really silly formula to get that even better. He\u2019s getting clothes sent out to major label artists right now for free (aside from the cost of shipping and production) because he\u2019s speaking the right language and sending clothes that people actually want. Same thing can be applied to songs. Might make a little outline and post it in here for everyone because it\u2019s not only super important for the entry level grind, but it helps in day to day communication as well!!",

Almost everyone I know, and seemingly everyone that asks questions here, just needs to write lyrics and melody over and over and over.\n\nIf you want to get reps to become a producer, that's awesome.

I\u2019m in mastering now, so while I do a lot of collaboration it\u2019s not quite what you\u2019re getting at here but I\u2019ve got a decent amount of experience in the room/tracking/producing. \n\nTo me it is a matter of developing trust and belief with another person. My approach is to be brutally honest with people and let the chips fall where they may. When things are amazing, meh, or bad. As @BatMeckley said\u2026you want the $10k mic. Don\u2019t waste the time with anything in the middle.\n\nSo in short \u2014 I\u2019d just tell them exactly what you wrote above. But I tend to be more on the extremes \u2014 I\u2019d like to think that people come away from working with me with a deep-seated belief in themselves and their potential but also honest feedback about very specific things we can do better. I actively seek to challenge my collaborators (which I\u2019m sure you do as well). I\u2019ve found people really respond to this if it\u2019s done with the clear intention to help both of us improve and with the curiosity of the potential in the art!\n\nIn short, I\u2019m an extreme encourager but also a harsh critic (in a kind way). I never let someone give up on themselves if I can help it and show love for them by very specifically calling out how I recognize their potential but see areas for improvement!\n\nI feel that I\u2019ve always been able to tell when people do things like \u201clead with a compliment\u201d or whatever. So that\u2019s my POV on this whole topic\u2026I just like people to be straight with me. When I have dealt with artists who clearly need the validation you\u2019re speaking about\u2026.I\u2019ll specifically call it out with something like \u201cstop looking for validation you have the talent to do this now start believing in yourself\u201d\u2026etc. Seems sort of harsh but it really can cut to the chase and open up a deeper level of trust and communication.\n\nSometimes people don\u2019t like this\u2026and that\u2019s all good too. Always lead with kindness and things work out. Depth > quantity",

If the emotion is authentic, the song has a MUCH better chance of connecting. Without that emotion, it is almost impossible. \n\nThe more I write songs, the older I get, the more I work with the greatest songwriters, the more I think that writing an authentic emotion is everything. \n\nA favorite example (I have 100 more, just ask): \n\nParty In The USA. Silly pop song? Or deep truth about the power of music being able to transcend loneliness? Go into the lyric and you realize it's Jessie J writing about her first time coming to Los Angeles: \n\nStepped off the plane at LAX with a dream and a cardigan... am I gonna fit in... everybody looks so famous... I'm feeling homesick, too much pressure and I'm nervous... but then my favorite song comes on the radio... I know I'm gonna be ok... it's a party in the USA\"\n\nTbh I tear up every time I think about this song. Yeah people might not analyze the lyric, but the reason this song will play for the next 50 years (and not the 1mil other simple songs about having a party) is the deep, authentic, universal emotion underlying the record.",

    "content": "I'll give a point by point analysis, cuz why not?\n\nFirst off, I love Irving Berlin. One of the greatest ever. White Christmas, God Bless America, Always, Cheek to Cheek. A master of the craft. \n\nThat being said, adhering to portions of this list could lead a songwriter in 2024 exactly in the wrong direction. Keep in mind two things: one, great artists are rarely great explainers of what makes them great. And two, his career ended in the late 1950s. This means his golden era was pre-Motown, pre-Beates, pre-television, etc.\n\nOk, my thoughts:\n\n1. This doesn't apply any more. He's speaking in relation to a time when music was more complicated. Music is MUCH simpler now. For example, White Christmas has a much larger vocal range than every Selena Gomez song. Also, 99% of songs today are recorded by someone writing it. It's much more important for the singer/songwriter to sing the song in their vocal range than to worry about some future audience. People rarely write songs and then hire a demo singer any more.\n\n2. (and 7 and 8) The best advice on here. Simplify. \"Kill your children.\" Remove things you love in order to make the song more concise.\n\n3. No. The culture changed, there are a million counter examples since Motown/Beatles. Sure, you can write a song without gender (\"you\"), but saying songs SHOULD be genderless is just wrong.\n\n4. Don't write frivolous songs? I'm all about authenticity and connecting emotionally to a song, but this is strangely phrased and doesn't seem very instructive. \n\n5. Every time I've seen people try and follow this, they write bad songs. As the great David Foster said \"There are only 12 notes and 26 letters, and Beethoven and Shakespeare already did it better than you.\" You're unlikely to find original chords, melodies, or words. The only original thing is your own life experience. Don't be \"original,\" be honest.\n\n6. Kinda. I guess I mostly stick to this. But also, there are thousands of great counterexamples after 1960.\n\n7, 8, 9. All great",

We can waste a lot of time in life trying to give people what we think they want from us when it doesn't line up with our own thoughts or desires. Being honest with ourselves and open with others in this way can help to remove a lot of internal struggles that cause us distress. Of course I'm simplifying a nuanced point and everyone's personal context will vary. Nonetheless I do want to give a little positive feedback because while I'm far from a people-pleaser I do, from time to time, have to catch myself shying away from expressing how I really feel on a subject. Again it's nuanced and seems very plain and simple to say so, but being honest in your emotions with yourself and others to the best of your current abilities is going to serve everyone better at the end of the day.

Ideas I wouldn\u2019t have thought of as being good for a song. Gets me out of writing the same song too many times, and always makes me realise we have way more songs in us than we thought. Make a weapon out of your empathy and have fun - you can step into anyone\u2019s shoes and try thinking what song you might write if you were there.

Understand that it's ok to figure out what a song means after you write it.\n\n5. Understand that we're trying to make trees, not tables. (As in sometimes it's not healthy to keep refining something till it's too straight edge and the vitality is gone from it)\n\n6. Said it already but saying it again, don't check your phone before you write\n\n7. I don't always write lyrics. Sometimes i write a melody, sometimes a chord progression, sometimes lyrics. Every now and then i do a session of what i call Lego writing, where i try to see what lyrics i wrote before fit with what melody/chord progression etc. \n\n8. Oh and did i mention, it ruins my creativity to check my phone before i make anything? \n\nThis is what works for me, hope it helps you!",

Choose an interval of time that you want to spend practicing a song (10 min, 15 min, 20 min) and practice Song #1 for that amount of time. Then - even if you're not proficient or haven't yet committed the song to memory - move on to practicing Song #2 and let the first song process and consolidate in your memory while you work on Song #2. \n\nWash, rinse, repeat until you go through the entire rotation of songs.  If some songs are significantly more difficult to learn or memorize then come back to them more often. The point is to constantly be checking back in on the songs that you're trying to learn just as you're on the threshold of forgetting them.",

I\u2019ve got some projects that I\u2019ve put many hours into, just to let them sit on a hard drive for years.\n\nCo-writing has helped a lot, and has taken some ideas to places I never would have thought to go. The feeling that you have some moral obligation to your collaborators to finish is motivating. When you\u2019re making art for yourself, it doesn\u2019t benefit from those positive forces of peer pressure, and there\u2019s a lack of constraints and no sense of urgency. \n\nI think making creative decisions is metabolically expensive. It\u2019s easier to defer all decisions, which is why you see DAW-age producers committing to so little until the mix. In the same way you can defer the entire songwriting process, especially if you have someone else\u2019s project or deadline to prioritize over your own.\n\nTo be both the creative mind and the executive finisher is a lot of exhausting context switching. Some options might be to split these responsibilities with someone else, or to dedicate separate time to each task. If someone hires me to print stems or solder a patchbay, the last thing I want to do is engage in creativity. But when I get inspired to write, I don\u2019t want to stop and troubleshoot the plug-in that\u2019s crashing the session.\n\nMaybe like the divergence/convergence approach would be to set aside an hour or three at the end of your day to finish ideas you\u2019ve already got brewing\u2014set a timer and finish a song, or a verse. Or, even better yet, dedicate the *end* of your day to play and experimentation. Then the next morning, hopefully with fresh perspective, get in the mood to tie up loose ends and prepare your next steps. You\u2019ve demonstrated that you\u2019re good at wearing that hat for other artists, so you can do it for your songs, too. Just maybe not while you\u2019re in the creative flow.\n\nI\u2019m not practicing what I preach, just brain-dumping. I definitely don\u2019t have this figured out.",

No agonizing over lyrics or Melodies or whatever, if it rhymes and makes some kind of sense, move on with it. \n2) first year: ever song needed a key change or modal shift. Second year: shifting or alt time signatures. Third year: some other esoteric tool I wanted to learn etc\u2026\n3) the moment you\u2019re done, record a voice memo and send it to someone.

They don't really get stuck anywhere. If something isn't working (even if they suggested it), they're comfortable moving forward. Just forward momentum, very little negative energy.\n\nAnd so much of that is *simply doing it a lot*. It's great to talk about tips and tricks (and yes, morning routines), but mostly it's just putting in time where you're enjoying doing it. \n\nThat's why I think learning songs is so important. It's actually not really about intellectualizing or analyzing what great songs are doing. It's much more just practicing being in the feeling of singing and playing great music. It's the same feeling you're after when you write. By learning great songs and singing them, you get comfortable in that feeling and you're better able to connect to it when writing.",

The point is to relieve yourself of any editing and force yourself to quickly write lyrics and melodies. \n\nIt's doing two separate and important things: building muscle memory and teaching to work on instinct.\n\nBuilding songwriting muscle memory is just like learning a language. You're practicing over and over until you learn how to express yourself emotionally. This is the basics component. You'll learn what notes you can hit and what words rhyme and how rhythms bounce. You'll build a foundation that will become second nature.\n\nRelated but distinct, you will learn how to move quickly. It turns out most great songs come in an unthinking way. Until you learn how to write without editing and thinking about what you're doing, you are less likely to write those great songs.\n\nI'm speaking from a lot of personal experience, but also whether it's Hemmingway's \"write drunk edit sober,\" or the Rick Rubin, Pharrell, etc. belief that great songs come from some power outside of ourselves (\"Source\" or God or whatever), learning to create without being analytical is super super important.",

I've been binge-listening to Conversations and in one episode, someone suggested something that might be fun.\n\nIt's a game of telephone/Chinese whispers (is that name for it cancelled?) but with songs - so the first person in the chain writes a song, then the second person listens and rewrites it in their own style, and so on and so on. The key point being that if it's your turn to write, you only get to listen to the song before you ONCE before you write yours.\n\nI really like this idea, I think it'd be cool to see what ideas we get from each other, what stands out the most from each person's interpretation, and so on and so on.\n\nThoughts?",

    "content": "I've always been inspired by the working relationship between Elton John and Bernie Taupin. \n\nBernie (who strictly writes lyrics) would mail completed lyrics to Elton, who would sit at the piano and write to them. I can see several advantages  here:\n\nA) You have a complete subject, theme, and narrative arc.\n\nB) The dramatic arc of the lyric informs the shape of the music, which can give the lyric additional support and also shake the writer out of their usual approach.\n\nC) The lyric can be stretched or compressed until it finds it's proper cadence and allow the singer (Elton) to find the best melodic fit to support the lyrics.",

If each song works best with their voice and thematically, why complicate it?\n\nWe're also in an era where because everyone has access to EVERYTHING on the internet, there's this desire to be more broad. But the things that last are often deeper, not broader. If G is the key, stick with it and go deeper",
