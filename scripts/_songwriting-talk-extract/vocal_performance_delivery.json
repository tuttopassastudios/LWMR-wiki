    "content": "I have a different angle you could try. I would focus almost all your energy on becoming a better, more truthful, richer lyricist. That's the only place you'll be original because there's only one you. Paradoxically, it's also the way you'll write songs that have a universal appeal because the more personal you get, the more the underlying universal emotions will resonate with people.\n\nTrying to be analytical about melodies and structure and style when writing has never yielded good songs for me or literally anyone I know. All the best songwriters I've met write all their best songs lyrics first.\n\nAlso, when you have something to say, it's surprising how little you pay attention to the melody. The melodies and structural components seem to just come when your heart is already in the story.\n\nThe only other thing I'd say is learn A+ songs. Learn the lyrics completely and learn the story behind them as much as possible. Then learn to sing them the way the original version is sung. That will expand your vocabulary as a vocalist and reinforce great lyrics.\n\nLastly, technology is going to continue to increasingly replace stylistic innovation. Yeah AI blah blah blah, but already drum machines and synth presets and splice and DAWs. The last thing to be replaced will be you personally writing things from your experience. Songs about your deepest insecurities and songs about your pet gerbil both fall into this category. Explore all of it.",

(recently it's been Tom Petty Wildflowers at the piano). Then I look at my phone and start my day.\n\nHard to know for sure if it's causal, but my songwriting abilities have sped up. I'm quicker in sessions, both with topline and tracks. \n\nI think it's related to several aspects of the morning routine, and they all compound. \n\n*I'm playing music before I'm on my phone, so I'm outputting music before my brain starts reacting.\n\n*doing scales w piano and voice opens up my vocabulary on both instruments and makes me much more comfortable to sing/play ideas when writing\n*doing these to a metronome has improved my timing on all instruments (not just piano and vocal)\n*learning a great song and singing it every morning has massively improved my lyrical writing/ improvisation (probably the hardest part of songwriting) by just reinforcing good *sounding* words.\n*singing and recording the same song every morning for a few days or a week makes me really THINK about vocals and vocal production. How I'm singing the words, how to push certain vowels in a certain part of my voice, etc \n\n@Slow Hand  @Ross Fortune @Will Melones @OJ",

    "content": "Yes exactly! I've found that the best songs are never calculated, they're always just felt as they're being created. They are magical/ incalculable moments. As soon as people start analyzing \u2013 \"is this too generic?\" \"maybe we should have a part like **insert artist**\" \u2013 the songs loses its magic.\n\nBut the paradox is that you can't  just sit around and wait for them to happen. You have to be in motion. So often times building habits and processes (which are calculated) is a great way to keep oneself in the motion of creating things. Piano scales, learning songs, writing a song a day, etc., are just some of the many ways to do this.\n\nAnd the other aspect is also correct. These are skill building exercises that help the quick translation of creative ideas. It's the emotional and psychological side of workflow. Just like technical workflow \u2013 where you want the shortest time between idea an execution \u2013 same goes for writing. If you are constantly writing lyrics and singing melodies and playing instruments, when that emotional magical idea arrives, you can translate it more quickly into lyrics, melody, and music.",

I don\u2019t need or even love the sound of my own voice, but it makes more sense to me when I\u2019m the context of others. \n\nI used to think that was a weakness, (thanks Ayn Rand,) but now I employ it thoughtfully and it\u2019s a bit of a superpower. \n\nNot saying you should think of yourself this way, but the artists I know who are successful on a large scale are obsessed with themselves in a way I was never comfortable with.

    "content": "Watched this video last night of Billie and Finneas talking about writing \"Birds of a Feather.\" The main thing that stood out to me was hearing them discuss how long it took and how much they disliked the song at first. It sounds like they were writing and rewriting it for almost a year and it almost didn't make the album. They also emphasized the amount of time it took to record; Billie mentioned that it took a bunch of days just to figure out the delivery of the first line and at one point Finneas was like \"oh yeah, that 10 second vocal stack tucked way in the background took us 7 hours.\" I feel like we all hear stories of great songs being written and recorded really quickly and at least for myself I sometimes find it frustrating and discouraging when things aren't coming together like that. I think this is partly because I'm comparing myself to a made up notion that all of the best artists/writers/producers are able to consistently finish a great song in a single session. But I guess this video is reminding me that sometimes the quality that makes these people great is their perseverance and willingness to face discomfort and frustration and keep going long enough to finish an idea.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bkjEO_Zj2g&ab_channel=BillieEilish",

    "content": "Depending on the kind of wall that you\u2019re hitting with her, there are a few simple approaches that you can suggest that will get her thinking about the different dimensions of melody and how to play with it:\n\nA) Expansion - How long is the melody? It is a small fragment, or a full sentence? Stretch it out over a longer period of time. Sing it half as fast. Hold certain notes for emphasis.\n\nB) Diminution - Compress parts of the melody into faster runs. Make it shorter. Remove notes. Simplify the melody to its melodic essence.\n\nC) Repetition - Take a fragment of the melody and play it again. And again. And again.\n\nD) Modulation - Take a melodic idea and transpose it to different keys. The first movement of Beethoven\u2019s 5th Symphony is built entirely off of a simple four-note motif. He got a lot of mileage from such a small element.\n\nE) Dynamics - Play with volume or intensity. Encourage her to go from soft to loud, or loud to soft. Accent certain notes for emphasis. This one is really powerful. For inspiration suggest that she try voicing her dynamics like a great horn player might. Get her to clip her notes very short or to make them \u201cbloom\u201d or be soft and round. Make them bark or be breathy.\n\nF) Be Another Instrument - Encourage her to try writing as another instrument with her voice. Sing a bass line. Sing a horn part. Sing percussively like Michael Jackson or James Brown would.\n\nG) Role Playing - Give her a character and a persona to inhabit. Make her sing the same thing as different personalities or people. Pick a melody and then make her sing it in the style of three singers that she\u2019d know.",

    "content": "I'll give a point by point analysis, cuz why not?\n\nFirst off, I love Irving Berlin. One of the greatest ever. White Christmas, God Bless America, Always, Cheek to Cheek. A master of the craft. \n\nThat being said, adhering to portions of this list could lead a songwriter in 2024 exactly in the wrong direction. Keep in mind two things: one, great artists are rarely great explainers of what makes them great. And two, his career ended in the late 1950s. This means his golden era was pre-Motown, pre-Beates, pre-television, etc.\n\nOk, my thoughts:\n\n1. This doesn't apply any more. He's speaking in relation to a time when music was more complicated. Music is MUCH simpler now. For example, White Christmas has a much larger vocal range than every Selena Gomez song. Also, 99% of songs today are recorded by someone writing it. It's much more important for the singer/songwriter to sing the song in their vocal range than to worry about some future audience. People rarely write songs and then hire a demo singer any more.\n\n2. (and 7 and 8) The best advice on here. Simplify. \"Kill your children.\" Remove things you love in order to make the song more concise.\n\n3. No. The culture changed, there are a million counter examples since Motown/Beatles. Sure, you can write a song without gender (\"you\"), but saying songs SHOULD be genderless is just wrong.\n\n4. Don't write frivolous songs? I'm all about authenticity and connecting emotionally to a song, but this is strangely phrased and doesn't seem very instructive. \n\n5. Every time I've seen people try and follow this, they write bad songs. As the great David Foster said \"There are only 12 notes and 26 letters, and Beethoven and Shakespeare already did it better than you.\" You're unlikely to find original chords, melodies, or words. The only original thing is your own life experience. Don't be \"original,\" be honest.\n\n6. Kinda. I guess I mostly stick to this. But also, there are thousands of great counterexamples after 1960.\n\n7, 8, 9. All great",

We can waste a lot of time in life trying to give people what we think they want from us when it doesn't line up with our own thoughts or desires. Being honest with ourselves and open with others in this way can help to remove a lot of internal struggles that cause us distress. Of course I'm simplifying a nuanced point and everyone's personal context will vary. Nonetheless I do want to give a little positive feedback because while I'm far from a people-pleaser I do, from time to time, have to catch myself shying away from expressing how I really feel on a subject. Again it's nuanced and seems very plain and simple to say so, but being honest in your emotions with yourself and others to the best of your current abilities is going to serve everyone better at the end of the day.

They don't really get stuck anywhere. If something isn't working (even if they suggested it), they're comfortable moving forward. Just forward momentum, very little negative energy.\n\nAnd so much of that is *simply doing it a lot*. It's great to talk about tips and tricks (and yes, morning routines), but mostly it's just putting in time where you're enjoying doing it. \n\nThat's why I think learning songs is so important. It's actually not really about intellectualizing or analyzing what great songs are doing. It's much more just practicing being in the feeling of singing and playing great music. It's the same feeling you're after when you write. By learning great songs and singing them, you get comfortable in that feeling and you're better able to connect to it when writing.",

Unfortunately being in London almost 100% of my work has been remote, I\u2019ve found myself tracking drums, bass, vocals, trumpet etc all using AudioMovers and while it\u2019s great to finish projects I agree with you that it\u2019s way better to do any or all of the above in person.\n\nThat said maybe the cold call/ intro is more like a \u201chey, here is some of my stuff, let\u2019s jump on a zoom call, if you don\u2019t hate me in the first 30 mins come hang at the studio for a day\u201d \n\nThat all said, if anyone on here wants to jump on and do a session hit me up \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks again Matt, even more keen to push forward now!",

Scared of exposing myself and what i'm feeling even to the cowriters or people that I'm sharing music with. Fuck, and I'm even shy about sharing it with my girlfriend and my family. Slowly growing out of it by training myself to be emotionally honest and vulnerable. And I also recognized that this issue is not only in songwriting but also in playing music and just expressing myself in general. ** If anyone is also struggling with this, you are not alone.

A great song is only a great song if people will want to cover it in 30 years\u201d \n\nI think about this a lot. My natural tendency (for better or worse) is to sit on records/songs that I've made for myself. No rush. I'll often ask myself \"Am I missing the window of opportunity here by not releasing?\" and my answer is often some version of \"If it's a good record today then, it'll still be a good record tomorrow\". Ideally it's release is not dependent on catching a wave before the popularity runs out.\n\nOf course, I'm unlikely to seize upon the cultural zeitgeist with this behavior, and there's a lot of reasons to not do what I do, but Alan's line of thinking feels right for my needs.",

For example, I can try break down the drums of a song into a  drum pattern, dynamics, feel, and the drum sound (type of drum kit, machine, and processing on it). \n\nBut with lyrics (or language) - it feels more gray to pinpoint how to take a concept and apply it into my own writing. How do you usually break it down?",

His instincts for great melody and rhythm, paired with lyrics that sound good, is unmatched. And I say \"sound good,\" because though I think many of the lyrics of his songs are meaningful (especially with the best lyric co-writers), the choice of words and how they are emphasized and enunciated is what separates him from everyone else. It's like Michael Jackson. \n\nDo some YouTube searching on artists talking about working with Max Martin. You can learn a LOT about writing vocal from him.",

The other end is the artist who is compelled to do it and it has to turn it off in order to live a normal life.\n\nMost people here are somewhere in between. For most of us, the key is to do a combination of two things:\n\n1. Find every way possible at all times to joyfully write. Direct yourself toward it with how live. Write silly things for fun, have a guitar you like to play next to the place you always like to sit, write emotional things for catharsis, write with other people for the collaborative joy, sing in the shower, write on different instruments that feel inspiring, etc etc \n\n2. The harder part is developing habits and practices that keep you consistent. It's easy to write when it's fun. It's harder to write when it's not fun, and that's the time to make sure you're doing it. Daily practices, schedules, deadlines (self imposed or otherwise) are the best way to do this.",

As a songwriter I have this toolbox of melodic and harmonic approaches  that I can use to solve any problem when making a song, or to have direction to create another section. But recently I've been noticing that something that makes a huge impact on songs is how the different sections relate to the tempo of the track. I think this might not happen to people who write to a beat, but I think that when you are playing an instrument, tempo is so fluid that some parts of a song might \"feel\" good and others won't (at a same tempo). When all the sections flow well into another in terms of tempo (and probably how that affects to vocal delivery) it sucks you in as a listener and it is way more singable/enjoyable. And now I'm starting to see this as a priority more than which notes of the scale have more weight on the chorus and stuff like that.",

Weight sometimes means notes that are held longer than the other sometimes the opposite. Contrasts can do a lot though. Range of movement or the range of the pitches themselves, pacing of the rhythm and rests, breaking the patterns/repetition can help with contrast",

    "content": "Couldn't agree more! I think what I was trying to say is that melodic rhythm is very much related to the tempo of the song and the delivery of the singer. And when tempo changes, even if the ratio remains the same, it has a different impact on how it feels. And, sometimes, because you might not be writing to a click, different sections of a song might \"feel\" cohesive at different tempos. And when you sum everything up it just doesn't translate well. And I've had the experience of trying to work around it but ended up noticing that it didn't have to do with the melodic rhythm in each section, but how it relates to the whole song. And now I try to be more aware of it because I think it might be something that is not easily noticeable when you are writing. I don't know if that makes sense (I'm not a native english speaker and therefore I struggle a bit sometimes \ud83d\ude06 ).",

    "content": "I deal with (unintentional) inconsistent tempo and some time even time signature/pulse pretty often when working with songwriters and artists. It seems to solve the problem when you tap your feet to the melody. Then you would realize that the tempo has changed. And count 1-2-3-4 or whatever the meter is. So you don\u2019t end up unintentionally having an extra beat because of words and disrupt everything else. A lot of writers ask people for beats first for this reason, but if the melody doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own- relying on the beats will do more harm than good in my opinion. They often end up being mediocre melodies from my experience because there\u2019s already tons of subdivisions and grooves in the beat and the topliner is relying on that to drive the rhythmic feel. But also beats need to come in with pocket so there are space for the vocal melody to fit in. It would be good for writers to start without a beat or instrumentals and it would be good for beatmakers to practice leaving vocal pockets when starting with a beat first",

I feel like I\u2019ve been doing this for awhile and just started noticing recently when @Rob Domos  told me my run on sentence of a chorus was terrible (I still love you) because it wasn\u2019t perfectly symmetrical with the first half of the chorus. But to me, having that manic performance really struck home the idea that you\u2019re experiencing a blur of the night just to lead up to an extremely quiet post chorus to make it feel like you woke up alone. Both of those themes also reference the lyrics of course. Idk this doesn\u2019t make that much sense without context, but that\u2019s really been on my mind. I feel like I\u2019m broken for not making everything extremely simple but I like to think that even average listeners feel more from the performance and energy of things changing than just having something that\u2019s super predictable. I don\u2019t think people particularly like simple songs over songs that make them feel something.",

A lot of this melodic intuition will come with time, familiarity and having a feel for what\u2019s possible.\n\nHow is her ear? I\u2019ve worked with plenty of great singers with little-to-no comprehension for theory. While it can help, I find that for some personality types being too technical and trying to get them to learn theory is a turnoff and is never going to happen. Where does she fit on this spectrum?\n\nDo your best to assure her that she can open up and not be perfect right away. It sounds like she might be clamming up a little bit because she feels uncertain or unconfident. I always try to give my singers a place where they will feel comfortable throwing out any idea. Even horrible ones. It\u2019s okay to fail or fall on your face.  Maybe she needs some reassurance in order to open up. Let her know that she doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Many singers do better when they have a safe space to open up and attempt new things. Even Prince would tell his engineer to leave the room every time when it became time to track his vocals. Hendrix would hide himself behind a wall of gobos where nobody could see him.",

And they should be, because it's elegant and it's exciting.\n\nMy concern is that they may rest on their feelings of accomplishment and not give it that extra push and exploration that I believe it needs to truly shine.\n\nWhat do you find is a good way to guide collaborators towards exploring an idea further and pushing themselves harder to really make something exceptional? I feel there are only so many ways that I can say \"I really like what you've done, but let's explore some more stuff\" without exhausting them or undermining the praise that I am giving them. How do I show them what's possible without micromanaging and writing it myself? It should come from within them and feel like it's theirs.",

I don\u2019t do it anymore, I just master but I am playing with a lot of these ideas applied to my own workflow\u2026i.e. finishing things, focusing on my intuitive flow state\u2026letting things just \u201ccome\u201d to me.\n\nI saw you mentioned you\u2019re applying the practice of scales/learning songs first thing in the morning, etc. I\u2019m assuming that these things just \u201cfind\u201d their way into your workflow when the time is right and you have grasped them.\n\nWhen you\u2019re creating, how often are you actively trying to fit the song into some predetermined mold that you\u2019ve set out? Or are you mostly just accepting what comes?\n\nI saw a great Bill Evans documentary where he said something along the lines of \u201cjust play what you can, and what you are, do not worry about if it\u2019s complicated/advanced/etc\u2026it\u2019s more authentic to play something simple that you feel than something complicated just for the sake of it\u201d\u2026he was talking about jazz improv but I\u2019ve tied it with much success into my work\u2026when it\u2019s time to go I\u2019m only using things I know intuitively and not trying to force myself to be \u201cbetter\u201d than what I really am in that moment. I set aside other time to raise my skill set/potential with specific things (like scales, but for mastering haha)\n\nJust curious if this kind of stuff is on your mind and something you\u2019re actively pursuing. \n\nI think it ties really deeply into the notion of \u201cjust write\u201d\u2026the skills and good music will come. \n\nBut your perspective is so valuable because you\u2019re working on records with deadlines/commercial implications/expectations/etc",

Often you have to sacrifice one virtue to gain another, but there are certainly valuable aspects of music that have been lost over time with popular music. Our melodies and harmonies no longer have long arcs where different points in the journey express different points on an emotional rollercoaster, which was a staple aspect of most classics from 80 years ago. Hell even 30 years ago Disney songs had beautiful arcs. Sing \u201cpart of your world\u201d from the little mermaid to yourself and feel the rollercoaster of the arc in that hook. It\u2019s magical. I think that\u2019s a lot of what makes a song like Bohemian Rhapsody so impactful and we have close to none of it these days.",

Could be a simple guitar chord progression with a little something on top, could be riff or banging drum patterns. Important thing here for me is to continue moving on to next ideas if I don\u2019t get an immediate response (which is usually singing on top) and continue to work my way into it. \n\nI like to have full drums ready to go somewhere on my computer. So I can just import it in, and it will get people moving. Splice drum loops are fine too. Some sort of instant vibe is needed in my experience. Splice really helps with that, because then you don\u2019t have people looking at the back of your head trying to dial in drums or synth patch for more than 5 minutes.",

And I typically don\u2019t touch lyrics anymore because I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m not that great at lyrics yet and if I don\u2019t have a line (which I usually don\u2019t\u2026.), it\u2019s better to leave it be for the longevity of relationship because lyrics can be one of the most personal things in music making because\u2026 it is literal. If you are more lyrics person, I think you can get a lot of value out of hanging out. \n\nFirst thing is creating safe space- and it really depends on person to person. Some people never open up, some people can open up immediately. In my experience, the more experienced they are - the more they tend to be the latter. I think how much time you spend on it can be dependent on this. You mentioned wanting to be more intentional, one idea that came to my mind is communicating this from the get go. Obviously there are going to be times where bring this up can be weird in the beginning of the session, but it should get them to think about opening up as part of work at the very least. It needs to be done carefully of course\n\nThe other part of it is understanding the person themselves. Their general vibe and energy. It\u2019s easier to tell with some folks, and it\u2019s harder to know what kind of person it is with some other folks. regarding this, I find diving into work right away helps feel it out. my job is often to constantly create ideas and inspirations. I can often gather some information from how they respond to different ideas. \n\nLastly, I used to spend a lot of time hanging up until very recently and I found it\u2019s so much more productive to just work and bond through that experience. Nature of work calls for connecting on a personal level, but it doesn\u2019t require it. I\u2019ve been trying to take it easy on getting closer with people, and focusing on the overall experience of collaboration and it has been making sessions more productive. So I plan on sticking with this way for a bit and see how it goes!",

Those are the only things that can't be done without the artist there. I'll get the production together as much as it needs to be to get the artist excited about the song. \n\nThe challenge is doing this quickly, without spending unnecessary time going through snares and patches and shit. I find that nearly all of the best songs I've written happen in about an hour long window of excitement. Sometimes you can stretch and get harmonies or punch in some vocals beyond that hour, but the excitement of a great idea is exhausting and it's hard to keep everyone 100% engaged for a long period of time. If I'm on hour 2 of a song and we're still trying to decide if we like a chorus, 100% of the time it's not a good song (in my experience).\n\nA BIG mistake I make (still) is \"oh we have tomorrow we can take a break and come back.\" It's not about being able to get the artist physically back, but getting everyone back into the emotional space. So much of what I need from an artist is the emotional focused to commit 100% to a vocal.",

    "content": "Kind of a weird question for y'all. What do you think about using moments of silence in a song? The song I'm working on right now has it as a placeholder in a small spot. However, within the specific context it's in, I honestly like the choice and am tempted to keep it. That said, since I've never had any of my songs do that, it's harder to trust my gut instinct on this one.  Thus, I wanted to get some other perspectives on the tactic. I've also rarely heard songs that implement it.",

I love silences in songs and when I\u2019ve heard this technique in recorded tunes it\u2019s predominantly been in indie rock tunes from bands like The Strokes and Catfish & The Bottlemen & they have a pause for like a bar (i can find the songs where they do this if you\u2019d like, can\u2019t remember them off the top of my head haha). \n\nAlso, it\u2019s becoming a thing in live performances too!!

Regardless, one of my good friends and I have committed to a sort of \"exposure therapy\" in getting together once a week or so to make stuff. My friend is an excellent guitar player and we've worked together in various capacities for a long time, but every time we get together the stuff he brings to the table is just balls out riffs and fanciful effects/tone that don't really translate to a seedling of a song. I have a hard time hearing where to take things or having a clear feeling about the sounds.",

Also love how its about a collective experience about missing a former lover in the physical world and thinking about them.\n\nAnd in classic fashion I've been signing the second line as, \"All these you shaped thoughts\" as opposed to apparently she is singing \"Always\". It should have \"always\" been \"all these\". Only realized my error when Googling the lyrics for this.",
