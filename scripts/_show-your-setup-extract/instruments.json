He wired up all my pedals, synths, and preamps to a couple of patch bays so I can throw signal all around the room in any order (complete with right-angle cables so I can use them with the desk doors closed). He also built MIDI lines to send clock from my DAW to the pedals and we upgraded the room to Mio MIDI-over-Ethernet units. Several other creature comforts that allow me to think less, like routing a headphone connection underneath the right side of my desk instead of the left where my interface is, adding a second one by the piano, and ready-to-go cables for guitars, synths and microphones already plugged in where they need to be.\n\nI'm going to run out of reasons not to call this studio \"done\" soon.",

Sure they might sing differently\u2026 but isn\u2019t that part of the point? I\u2019m interested in which microphone brings out the best in the singer and is inspiring to use.

Had to find a nice vegan friendly restaurant open at 11:30 PM which was a fun task. The engineer who ran the session is one of the few I\u2019m chill with, so he very briefly introduced me to swizz as \u201cEvan, the runner who makes some dope synth pop\u201d (alicia was warming up, but swizz was real down to earth and nice. very focused) and i actually got to catch a couple glimpses of what they were doing in the studio when I wasn\u2019t calling restaurants and polling my vegan friends for food recs. We actually spent more time communicating with engineers out East to get files fixed and communicating with a personal assistant of some kind who stopped by before to make sure things were going smoothly. \n\nAll that to say what little I did actually see was sick. Swizz goes crazyyyy on an MPC, man. Wow. That was fun to hear.\n\nAlso @cian riordan was right. I\u2019ve never heard our nearfields work that hard like ever. It was belligerently loud. Fletcher-Munson be damned lmao. I\u2019m sure they fired up the bigger shit when I left (unfortunately running does not pay the bills, or anyone really).",

    "content": "If you're doing vocals on hardwood or tile floor, rugs are great for nabbing first reflections off the floor. Most of what is bouncing back into the microphone is in that slappy high end area and will likely sound bad. With a guitar cab, the microphone will sit quite a bit lower to the ground -- so in theory this idea is even more useful. However, program-material depending, its likely whatever is coming out of the speaker is going to drastically overpower what gets slapped up from the floor. If there's a rug around I'll typically use it for these situations.",

Dividing the space with a wall like that essentially makes the back wall anechoic and uses the \u201cother room\u201d as a chamber to let low end that makes it though bounce around, lose energy, and be refiltered as it renters the room so it doesn\u2019t make it back to listening position. There is much more to it of course. It also catches stray reflections, etc so they don\u2019t make it back to listening.\n\nKeep in mind my room is designed to sound as good as possible in the listening position for mastering so reflections that help it feel fun/good for clients on a sofa aren\u2019t helpful to me! \n\nSynths are around because I like to continually remind myself how difficult finishing a record is and I find staying connected to playing makes me make much more musical mastering decisions!",

I do mostly production and session work as a bassist (and some mixing) and a big part of my motivation to treat this room and improve my monitoring has been to try to get to a point where I can confidently make better critical decisions early in the arranging/recording process. With that said I have enough limitations here (room size, work flow needs, etc) that having all of my keyboards in an ideal listening position has been a relatively low priority. I do have a headphone extension cable that can reach most places in the room and do a fair amount of work like that. Also recently switched to a wireless keyboard and mouse which has nothing to do with listening but has been extremely nice for being able to record myself in different parts of the room.",

This way I can keep the fireplace and windows from being covered up, and have some gobos to move around when needed for tracking. The small desk to the left of the mix position will be a rack for gear, the large rectangular thingy in the upper right will be an upright piano. I'll pack in some DIY tube traps around the monitors, and hang two 4'x2' panels I already own over the mix position. I'll also put two slightly smaller panels over the drums, and two more on the wall behind the drums. The french doors and the sliding doors to the closet behind the couch will have heavy curtains.",

I tested the HEDDs, Airpod Max, Audeze LCD-X and own the M50s and HD650s. \n\nI was looking for the headphone that gave me the best assortment of detail, fun, space, and \u201etranslation\u201c to speakers out of the box (without extra eq or another amp to power it outside of my UAD interface). \n\nFor my taste the Focals fit that perfectly. Even hooked up to my laptop directly the sound was extremely fun, detailed and useful in making decisions. \n\nAlso the look, comfort, travel case and extra pads are a nice touch. Only negative for me was the cable being a bit too short in a recording/moving around in a studio setting. But I wouldn\u2019t use them for that anyways. \n\nAirPod Max (with noise canceling) would probably be second. They just lack the finer details and deep bass for me. \n\nThen the LCD-x (they are technically better than the Airpods but I wouldn\u2019t prefer the LCDs in a real world setting. Only in the studio with some eq added).\n\nHEDDs I so heavily disliked it wasn\u2019t even funny. The UAD Interface can\u2019t power them properly and they just sounded like a crappy and weird set of nearfield speakers playing from either side of your ear. Can\u2019t even explain it.",

    "content": "So here\u2019s the roundup on my dumb drum thing. This is a scrappy little experiment on my part to see if I can get a convincing drum sound in my little drum room. Before starting this, I had the idea in my mind that if a room is good for mixing, it must be good for recording! *Insert Game Show Buzzer* I ran into many of the things I didn\u2019t like about the Barefoot Studio B Live room \u2014 and those things were exaggerated by a factor of 10. First of all, my room is very dead by design. It treats me great in mixing, but made for a real challenge when trying to get *some* sort of drum personality. I was also working with a pretty shitty old premier kit that hadn\u2019t seen the light of day in half a decade. Shitty cymbals, very quickly tuned heads \u2014 I wasn\u2019t setting myself up for success\u2026 but whatever.\n\nThe setup was a little ridiculous (minus a few utilitarian pieces):\nKick: Beta 52 -> Scully 280\nSnare: SM57 -> Scully 280\nOH Mono: Coles 4038 -> Ampex 351 -> 1176 (not compressing, just to trim gain before \u2018tools)\nOH L/R: U67s -> UTA pre (thanks Matt!)\nKick Room: U47 -> UTA Pre (again\u2026)\n\nThis is where I ended up, without mixing, and with some quick playing and utility EQ/balancing. No compression except a limiter to bring up the level. While the actual drums themselves don\u2019t sound amazing, I really struggled with getting any sort of energy out of the drums\u2026 it all just got sucked out. \n\nHere are the results if you care (don\u2019t judge my shitty playing)\n\nI think if it do this again I would:\n1) Have a better sounding kit. Turns out, shit in.. shit out. I knew this. We all know this. But here I am.\n2) Maybe put some sheets of plywood around to create some surface in the room. Just give it some life.\n3) Not use the Scully. It\u2019s so hard to get them to not sound distorty\u2026 I just don\u2019t have enough pres on hand to have clean path for everything. Mix studio living.\n\nSo it goes\u2026",

    "content": "I have a Hilo goes AES to speakers and as my send/capture for the Massive Passive...you can't see it here but there is a rack under the screen where it sits. I have a side car off the side (the walls look pretty tight but they are actually the unf*ck mass loaded vinyl L things, so the room opens up more behind them). The sidecar is back from those...its got a apogee symphony taking the ins for my synths (also not really pictured -- just hangarounds from my production days for the fun of it sometimes), Hazelrigg VLC in there too.\n\nThere is sorta a whole room behind the listening position...its 30 feet long with a floating wall for absorption about 15 feet in so the studio is like 13x15 but acoustically its larger if that makes sense.\n\nI do use streamdeck...but mainly to switch quickly between the hot ref in Wavelab and my master. I've gotten deep into Applescript which essentially handles all of the other Wavelab processes...it's almost finished but my streamdeck will essentially just launch those applications to do what I need. So I'd say it's very useful, but the coding I've been able to do will render it sorta meaningless for me (though convienent, I use it for other things like navigating websites when doing client outreach, etc which is very handy and makes my workflow like an order of magnitude quicker).\n\nChair is hag capisco. I love it. Had a serious back injury when I was younger so I'm pretty dialed into having things be ergonomic and I find it's great. Actually kinda rather uncomfortable...in a good way. You can't really slouch. Took some getting used to but it's interesting",

Please just let me know if there\u2019s a better thread for this sort of thing. \n\nI\u2019d be extremely grateful for any feedback! Here\u2019s some info: \n\n- I am currently moving my home studio to this basement space that is about 400 SQ feet. Concrete floor and walls except for the front wall shown in this picture - that is drywall as it separates the rest of the basement. \n\n- The ceiling joists are exposed and are about 7.5\u201d deep. \n\n- My primary function for this room will be mixing, but I will also be doing smaller overdubs like piano and vocals. \n\nCurrently, after painting the walls and floor, my plan is as follows: \n- Stuff the ceiling joists with insulation \u2014 probably Safe N Sound\u2026 thoughts on that choice? \n\n- Cover the joists with fabric from Gilford of Maine. \n\n- Figure out how to drill into concrete \ud83d\ude02 Then put panels everywhere. Most of my panels are about 4\u201d thick and are comprised of the safe n sound insulation. \n- Put some big rugs down but also leave a bit of the concrete exposed if possible cuz I like the look. Haha \n\n- My monitoring set up is NS10M\u2019s (don\u2019t laugh) with an Avantone CLA-100 amp and a PreSonus T10 sub. I\u2019ve got an Apollo 8 Duo and Apollo Twin X Quad. \n\nThat concludes my plan so far. Am I on the right track? \ud83d\ude33 \n\nI really appreciate any feedback you\u2019re willing to give. \ud83d\ude4f",

    "content": "My roommate just moved out of the house I\u2019m renting in Weho. I\u2019m thinking about moving my studio from the upstairs to the smaller downstairs room. Although the upstairs has more space, managing the temperature has been almost impossible. When the ac is off, you have very little time to record before it gets uncomfortably warm in there. My landlord (who is also an engineer) put in a swamp cooler that was meant for a bigger room in an attempt to manage the temp. Unfortunately, I think this bigger AC creates more humidity as it\u2019s filling up a smaller room than it is supposed to. I got a dehumidifier but it\u2019s not sufficient. \nThat being said, the room I\u2019m considering moving to downstairs has a door that connects to our two-way bathroom with our shower. Would I be better off finding a way to seal the downstairs door that connects to the bathroom and manage the humidity in the bathroom OR should I see if I can manage a better AC/ de humidifier situation upstairs. Any thoughts are welcome - I\u2019ll create a thread as well to not spam the channel. Thanks!",

    "content": "Yup! They're very similar in that regard, but still different. You can generally think of RM as the fast version of tremolo (volume modulation), in the way that FM synthesis is the fast version of vibrato (pitch modulation). Both techniques generate side bands through modulation rates that are in the audible range (> 20 Hz).\n\nThe difference between RM and tremolo is that tremolo is a uni-polar modulation and ring modulation is bipolar, which will generate different side bands. I'm a little fuzzy on the math of it these days, but if I remember correctly RM will generate negative side bands which are reflected at 0 Hz and start to travel back up the spectrum, whereas with AM they disappear when they get to 0 Hz.\n\nPop 'em in a frequency analyzer and watch the side bands go! Especially the RM. It's pretty informative.",
