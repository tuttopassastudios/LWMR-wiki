Desktop interface/monitor controller is the MT48, and my MacBook is sitting in the storage gap of my desk acting as the second screen. And I\u2019ve got a little 16U rack off to the side holding some gear for production related stuff.",

    "content": "Very very cool studio. Lots of guitars in absurd tunings and an upright piano. Comfy couch on a back wall with at least a foot of treatment. Room sounds (and looks) gorgeous, even without the pmc\u2019s on. Two of my fav guitar pedals on the desk within arms reach. Lots of natural light, chair has the flip up arms which is key for a guitar player. Literally on the same block as one of my fav stores/galleries. Lots to like about this place. \n\nI\u2019m always inspired by rooms clearly made for someone specific. I hate the all things to all people approach, which usually mean \u201cgreat at nothing specific\u201d. This room is a great reflection of @LAPhill. \n\nFun fact: no monitor controller. Neat.",

I mostly use my outboard pre\u2019s and those all have little labs attenuators before the console so I have a ton of control over the headroom. I also use it to buss stuff down like kick mics and guitar amps to keep track counts down.",

Idk about perfect but it\u2019s definitely a great room and the speakers aren\u2019t bad. Lots of nice things about them, very immersive. Only thing is the monitoring is going through a Neve 8816 Summing Mixer as the monitor controller and I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s super clean/transparent.",
