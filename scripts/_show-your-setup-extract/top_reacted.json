He wired up all my pedals, synths, and preamps to a couple of patch bays so I can throw signal all around the room in any order (complete with right-angle cables so I can use them with the desk doors closed). He also built MIDI lines to send clock from my DAW to the pedals and we upgraded the room to Mio MIDI-over-Ethernet units. Several other creature comforts that allow me to think less, like routing a headphone connection underneath the right side of my desk instead of the left where my interface is, adding a second one by the piano, and ready-to-go cables for guitars, synths and microphones already plugged in where they need to be.\n\nI'm going to run out of reasons not to call this studio \"done\" soon.",

I am new to the community and happy to have finally taken the jump into the discord after being an avid listener since the beginning.\n\nJust finished building my studio about half a year ago. I run a hybrid setup where everything is always connected and ready to go. All recording paths are accessed via an XLR patch-bay. Mixbus/Mastering gear is controlled by a Dangerous Liaison. Conversion is done via MADI and AES/EBU. Headphone CUE\u2019s are analog and via AVB. I like having everything connected and mic\u2019ed up because I notice that I only use the stuff that I can access quickly while producing/mixing. I went through a lot of trial and error building and working in this studio (been in this location for 1.5 years) so if anyone needs any input I would be happy to help!",

Also whats that ribbon mic pointing at? looks like its just setup in the middle, doing nothing. You should try two mics on the congas... I hear Neumann mics are good for this. Also make sure that ceiling fan is off, could create wierd flutters. Cool studio though, bet it sounds great.",
