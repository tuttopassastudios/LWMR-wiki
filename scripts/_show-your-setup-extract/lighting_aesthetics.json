    "content": "Hey guys! I am new to the community and happy to have finally taken the jump into the discord after being an avid listener since the beginning.\n\nJust finished building my studio about half a year ago. I run a hybrid setup where everything is always connected and ready to go. All recording paths are accessed via an XLR patch-bay. Mixbus/Mastering gear is controlled by a Dangerous Liaison. Conversion is done via MADI and AES/EBU. Headphone CUE\u2019s are analog and via AVB. I like having everything connected and mic\u2019ed up because I notice that I only use the stuff that I can access quickly while producing/mixing. I went through a lot of trial and error building and working in this studio (been in this location for 1.5 years) so if anyone needs any input I would be happy to help!",

That being said I\u2019m keeping my two two 6\u2019s and the Neumann 420\u2019s are filling the role that I\u2019m looking for, which is a full range cabinet.  The 420\u2019s frequency spectrum feels very top to bottom and very open.  The low end detail is very zoomed in. I definitely can hear more detail. The mid range also feels very detailed and the top end is nice and open but they are as bright as the PMC\u2019s but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing any information.  After listening to various songs on the 420\u2019s I thought damn these sound nice, and at the same time I thought but is that good? Like how will they respond actually working on them. Will they help my mixes or will they just sound good? So far they have been revealing and translating quite well. I was concerned about the 300-500hz. Feeling a little tucked in when listening to  finished mixes but as I put them to work I felt like they did show that info as well.  I really dig them and will likely buy them. But I think they might be a bit big for a single set of speakers and will still want to work on some  near fields. They definitely show me different things.",

Couple (long) notes\u2026I\u2019m sure @Nomograph Mastering can expand if he chooses:\n\nUnf*ck designed the room. Ruairi you are incredible at this and I\u2019m very grateful. The subtleties in the trade offs when designing a room are something I urge everyone to consider deeply as I learned when working with them!\n\n1. Studio is built in my basement\u202613 feet long x 30 wide x 8 tall (including treatment). Back wall divides it length wise and makes the studio part 12x15 approx.\n\n2. All treatment is built in\u2026entire ceiling is stuffed with 9 inch pink fluffy, couple inch rockwool in the walls, tuned mass loaded vinyl behind the \u201chousings\u201d to L and R of listening position. Back wall is 6 inches of safe n sound in a frame built of 2x8s (by contractor) with a 24\u201d door. It\u2019s standing by friction just slid tight to ceiling. Quite precise measuring required to do that and make it sturdy so a door can open well\n\n3. Since I get asked a lot\u2026the wall finishes are acoustic felt board. Went that direction because install was way better than a fabric wall (they are firm and can be cut with an exacto knife). Also they are absorptive with no reflections\u2026caveats apply if that\u2019s good for a given space though (rather than the acoustically transparent fabric).\n\n5. @BatMeckley can confirm hard front wall was farrrr superior for me. I had a soft one (felt) against Ruairi advice since I preferred the aesthetic lol, but room was too dead. Uncomfortable. When I switched I could hear much more depth and energy but everything still as crisp and clear. Highly recommend! \n\nHope this helps some people on here. FYI we started my room from concrete block, bare bones so could frame things to hold treatment needed.\n\nWill circle back with some better pics when I\u2019m home. This community has helped me greatly.\n\nCheers friends!",

The room plays a big part in how these speakers sound.\n\n- Cian\u2019s monitors are closer together than mine and he sits closer than I do. Where I think I get a wider view of music in my room, in his room it feels more tightly focused. If we put it in terms of a frame on a wall, my frame feels like 5\u2019 x 7\u2019 and his feels like it\u2019s 3\u2019 x 5.\u2019 Which makes sense given what we respectively do.\n\n- There was a noticeable difference in presentation of the midrange, His room seems like it is helping focus the midrange in a different way than mine does. I feel like my room is less opinionated, with maybe a bit of bias to the low end, his feels a biased toward the midrange without the same bias toward the low end. Which again, makes a lot of sense given what we respectively do.\n\n- The low end in his room is definitely tighter where mine is a bit less controlled. Both are totally viable and satisfying in different ways and either presentation wouldn\u2019t get in your way.\n\n- Vibe check is high. I covet his ceilings.",

I just got off the heels of two weeks using it as a main vocal mic so I kept it up. Context:  was recording a soprano which I've always found can make mics I think sound good sound awful... I rarely ever do shoot outs like this but felt like an appropriate opportunity. For this singer it came down to the 67 and the m930 and the 67 ended up edging out the m930 because it was slightly too detailed bordering on clinical (her words)... but love to see that lil' guy hold it's own. @herbie @chris_donlin",

Remove the treatment from the center there and put them right up against the wall. Where they are now, they look really wide and you'll still be feeling the effects of the gap between their position and back wall. You might be getting even more boundary effect from them being so close to the side walls as well. It might be counterintuitive to remove the treatment from the middle, but it really will probably help more than not. Yes, then you will have to deal with the big screen right in the sweet spot, but one step at a time lol.",

    "content": "Idk exactly how this applies to monitoring specifically, but if it helps to do a bunch of thinking up front so you do less thinking later when the clock is ticking and things that matter are on the line, I'm all for that, I think we all should be. I've been led to doing so by my own pathological tendencies but I don't think that approach is without legitimate merit.\n\nIn my view it connects to the theme that's come up a few times, most recently re: @cian riordan's monitoring situation vis-a-vis spending 10k to *remove doubt*. If something is going to take a psychological toll on you and prevent you from doing good work, or *nag at your soul*, then I sincerely believe you should go down the rabbit hole and understand what you're working with.\n\nIt's the same reason I value doing testing. Why I put in the time to confirm @BatMeckley's observations about Melodyne and write it up. Why I dug into the tech specs for Ableton Warp with @ALXCPH. Why many others in here have done deep dives on various things, like @Slow Hand did also with Ableton Warp. \n\nDoes it sometimes stray into sweating minutiae that don't really matter? Absolutely. But - and here's the part that I think is critical - **we are making things**, and hopefully trying to make the best things we can. You're gonna have a hard time working out what's important and what is not important if you don't go deep once in a while, but you'll have an even harder time if you don't then come up for air and see if the minutiae are relevant to your *work* or not. (This is the trap I see audiophiles fall into, being as, you know, they're not making work like we are.)",

    "content": "@Zack Hames I remember shopping for an engagement ring. I was ready to spend $12k on the right ring, and feeling real grown up about it. But the first thing Michelle did was go to a local showroom and figure out exactly what she wanted, not thinking about budget. Just size, shape, color, & setting. \n\nI waited till the spring sale and went down to have a look and see what was what. It was $27k before tax. \n\nI can\u2019t stress enough that Michelle is not bougie; she didn\u2019t pick the fanciest or biggest or \u201cmost expensive\u201d rock; she just found what she liked. \n\nI legit guffawed. And told the salesperson thank and was ready to leave. She looked at me and said \u201cwell what\u2019s your budget?\u201d I said $12.5. And tbh I was really fucking proud of that number walking in to the store, but when the saleswoman heard it she wasn\u2019t just crestfallen, she was annoyed. Like I was wasting her time. To say it took the wind outta my sails was an understatement. \n\nA few months later I told the story to the right friend, who new the right guy. Long story short I got almost the exact same ring for $4k. (The Diamond business is a fucking war zone, literally.) \n\nAnyway, point is, don\u2019t let these bougie Motherfuckers make you feel bad about being able to spend $20k building out your dream studio. That\u2019s a big number in almost every world. \n\nYou might not be able to do it the way you imagined, but you\u2019re gonna get there. 100% you\u2019ll end up with a great sounding room with a killer vibe, cause you know what you want and you\u2019ll keep working till it\u2019s right.",

    "content": "So I'm currently doing all of this (removed screen as well). I'm not sold just yet. \n\nFew issues: the listening position is still best in my old spot (about 34% into the room). So I have to pump more sound than before to get the same \"feeling\". Phantom center is also not as clear.\n\nAlso, the idea of getting a triangle gets thrown out the window. I'm further away than they are apart. Bass of course is bigger (even with a -6db roll-off) but I'm not sure if it's actually useful. And it seems like the walls are now vibrating more (already had a neighbor asking what I'm up to).\n\nAnd for some reason records that sounded great to me before now sound unlistenable and harsh in the upper mids. Not sure if this is true just yet though (see Walking on a Dream by Empire of the Sun). If this is what other people are also hearing maybe it's the detail I've been missing in the mids. Some songs are really painful.\n\nOn the plus side, the room is a bit \"deader\" and even now because I moved the treatment to the back (where previously there wasn't much). Also, reverb tails are very clear now. Before I couldn't really hear FX until I overdid them and dialed back. I'll try doing a mix like this and see if I intuitively make better decisions.",

Getting the smallest door possible mattered to me because I was after the absolute best sonic experience possible at the listening position only (hence the couch was largely irrelevant since it\u2019s only ever me in my room, wouldn\u2019t need to be changed, etc). But I did measure everything before I put the wall in!\n\nMy guess is your set up has much more to take into account so the extra 6 inches of door or whatever is useful to you!\n\nLight\u2026yes this was HUGE for me too. My previous studio had huge windows which were terrible for sound but amazing for my mood. So I went overboard to make sure it can be very bright with the lighting in ceiling (it changes with the time ala how Jon was talking about white light being better in morning, etc) \n\nSorry if the front wall discussion was confusing \u2014 it WAS felt but is now 3/4 inch sheets of Baltic Birch\u2026so it\u2019s hard!",

Listen to the pros @Nomograph Mastering or better hire @Gerhard Westphalen or something depending on the scope of what you're doing. Doing what I did could be worse isolation for all I know, for me I was after the best acoustic response possible and isolation wasn't a consideration\n\nAlso it looks like you have nice recessed electrical already installed down there too...something to think about it is a non-trival cost (in either time or money) to rip down, stuff and redo all that, or even just remount the lights",

    "content": "so OLED is where every pixel is its own backlight, microLED is that but without burn-in (but also like $100k for one), and miniLED is an in between. Essentially it's a QLED (lots of colors and bright af) with a ton of backlight zones/full array local dimming. Essentially it has great color depth and brightness without OLED problems, though it doesn't quite match the pixel response (but is still quite fast) and it's not quite as many backlight zones (since not every single pixel is its own backlight like on OLED and microLED). Hopefully that's not too much word vomit lol\n\nAt the end of the day, I have an OLED in the living room and a miniLED as a computer monitor and for everyday use as a monitor this is great. The advantages you'd gain of going with an actual monitor that has DisplayPort are good if your computer doesn't have HDMI 2.1 since you'd then be able to hit 120Hz at 4k and it would feel quite buttery smooth",

I tested the HEDDs, Airpod Max, Audeze LCD-X and own the M50s and HD650s. \n\nI was looking for the headphone that gave me the best assortment of detail, fun, space, and \u201etranslation\u201c to speakers out of the box (without extra eq or another amp to power it outside of my UAD interface). \n\nFor my taste the Focals fit that perfectly. Even hooked up to my laptop directly the sound was extremely fun, detailed and useful in making decisions. \n\nAlso the look, comfort, travel case and extra pads are a nice touch. Only negative for me was the cable being a bit too short in a recording/moving around in a studio setting. But I wouldn\u2019t use them for that anyways. \n\nAirPod Max (with noise canceling) would probably be second. They just lack the finer details and deep bass for me. \n\nThen the LCD-x (they are technically better than the Airpods but I wouldn\u2019t prefer the LCDs in a real world setting. Only in the studio with some eq added).\n\nHEDDs I so heavily disliked it wasn\u2019t even funny. The UAD Interface can\u2019t power them properly and they just sounded like a crappy and weird set of nearfield speakers playing from either side of your ear. Can\u2019t even explain it.",

    "content": "So here\u2019s the roundup on my dumb drum thing. This is a scrappy little experiment on my part to see if I can get a convincing drum sound in my little drum room. Before starting this, I had the idea in my mind that if a room is good for mixing, it must be good for recording! *Insert Game Show Buzzer* I ran into many of the things I didn\u2019t like about the Barefoot Studio B Live room \u2014 and those things were exaggerated by a factor of 10. First of all, my room is very dead by design. It treats me great in mixing, but made for a real challenge when trying to get *some* sort of drum personality. I was also working with a pretty shitty old premier kit that hadn\u2019t seen the light of day in half a decade. Shitty cymbals, very quickly tuned heads \u2014 I wasn\u2019t setting myself up for success\u2026 but whatever.\n\nThe setup was a little ridiculous (minus a few utilitarian pieces):\nKick: Beta 52 -> Scully 280\nSnare: SM57 -> Scully 280\nOH Mono: Coles 4038 -> Ampex 351 -> 1176 (not compressing, just to trim gain before \u2018tools)\nOH L/R: U67s -> UTA pre (thanks Matt!)\nKick Room: U47 -> UTA Pre (again\u2026)\n\nThis is where I ended up, without mixing, and with some quick playing and utility EQ/balancing. No compression except a limiter to bring up the level. While the actual drums themselves don\u2019t sound amazing, I really struggled with getting any sort of energy out of the drums\u2026 it all just got sucked out. \n\nHere are the results if you care (don\u2019t judge my shitty playing)\n\nI think if it do this again I would:\n1) Have a better sounding kit. Turns out, shit in.. shit out. I knew this. We all know this. But here I am.\n2) Maybe put some sheets of plywood around to create some surface in the room. Just give it some life.\n3) Not use the Scully. It\u2019s so hard to get them to not sound distorty\u2026 I just don\u2019t have enough pres on hand to have clean path for everything. Mix studio living.\n\nSo it goes\u2026",

The sidecar is back from those...its got a apogee symphony taking the ins for my synths (also not really pictured -- just hangarounds from my production days for the fun of it sometimes), Hazelrigg VLC in there too.\n\nThere is sorta a whole room behind the listening position...its 30 feet long with a floating wall for absorption about 15 feet in so the studio is like 13x15 but acoustically its larger if that makes sense.\n\nI do use streamdeck...but mainly to switch quickly between the hot ref in Wavelab and my master. I've gotten deep into Applescript which essentially handles all of the other Wavelab processes...it's almost finished but my streamdeck will essentially just launch those applications to do what I need. So I'd say it's very useful, but the coding I've been able to do will render it sorta meaningless for me (though convienent, I use it for other things like navigating websites when doing client outreach, etc which is very handy and makes my workflow like an order of magnitude quicker).\n\nChair is hag capisco. I love it. Had a serious back injury when I was younger so I'm pretty dialed into having things be ergonomic and I find it's great. Actually kinda rather uncomfortable...in a good way.

I know there's a lot more that goes into it than just doors, my room is literally concrete so the doors are by and large the weakest link.\n\nI have the ability to do double doors with an air gap. Does anyone have recommendations that aren't incredibly expensive for doors or types of doors i should use for this? I am planning exterior door so it's all sealed with weatherstripping and the Threshold, etc. \n\nAre basic exterior Fiberglass doors, if doubled with an airlock / gap, enough to be decent? I'd love to not spend thousands and thousands on doors.",

I literally have hollow doors with like inches of  gap beneath, anything is going to be a drastic improvement.\n\n@LAPhill I'll see if I can get solid core, I am simply going to use \"exterior doors\" that are ideally pre-hung so everything is sealed, threshold, weatherstripping, etc.\n\nThanks for letting me suss this out on here, I just needed to know if I was *Fucked*. If I can get some doors for less than $1000 and there's an improvement i'll be happy. I can get make believe 9k doors later.",

I was looking into those monitor stands that have those clip-on/screw-on things to attach them to a desk, but those clips are all made for desks and tables, so horizontal planks. For my bedframe they would need to be angled down, since the planks are vertical. Is there any product out there or anything I could piece together to make this work?",

I'm personally on the @Rollmottle train (also @cian riordan aesthetic is similarish)...I just agree aesthetically that I like the brighter/cleaner/warmer vibe. Of course your tastes may differ, but my lights dim like @montrose recording  said...it's really nice when it's getting later in the day to have some more dim lighting to match the outside a bit. \n\nAlso really love to keep things ultra simple visually...the least amout of things around (even cords, etc) but again that's just me. Different things inspire us all.\n\nAlso big fan of keeping the digital environment very organized, as few things open as I need. I still certainly can get distracted like the rest of us. One thing I underestimated about running a full time mastering shop is just the number of interactions per day that are needed...and that can definitely take you out of the flow so I tend to keep it very contained...say only respond at certain points of the day and generally I deliver all my files at the end of the day in one batch. I'm sure some similar type of thing can be achieved for us all no matter the process. Still a work in progress over here of course!\n\nMy final thought is that the best focus enabler I've found is just good old fashioned hard-nosed exercise. Getting up early, squatting heavy, hard sprints...taking things to the limit (safely) really allow me personally to retain a very real sense of resilience and focus. And increase and double-down on discipline -- which in turn increases motivation often for me!\n\nBest of luck! As far as I can tell, retaining focus in our current age is an eternally ongoing (and extremely valuable) skill to work on",

Some science I don't really understand behind that. There's a huberman lab out there somewhere about it. I backlit my screen display with blue leds as well. Honestly one of the best things when I actually stick to it is trying to never sit for longer than an hour. Even just a 5 minute stand up walk around helps me immensely. Related I drink a ton of water and forces me to get up to go to the bathroom more often.",
