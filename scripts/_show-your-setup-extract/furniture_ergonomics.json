He wired up all my pedals, synths, and preamps to a couple of patch bays so I can throw signal all around the room in any order (complete with right-angle cables so I can use them with the desk doors closed). He also built MIDI lines to send clock from my DAW to the pedals and we upgraded the room to Mio MIDI-over-Ethernet units. Several other creature comforts that allow me to think less, like routing a headphone connection underneath the right side of my desk instead of the left where my interface is, adding a second one by the piano, and ready-to-go cables for guitars, synths and microphones already plugged in where they need to be.\n\nI'm going to run out of reasons not to call this studio \"done\" soon.",

Then I was like\u2026 hey I should use this opportunity to get the house super dirty and build a full back wall bass trap like I\u2019ve been meaning to. Then\u2026 you know your shooting stuff in rew, and your like, hey I wonder what it looks like without my big desk. Then you move the desk and it\u2019s insanely better looking on the REW graph. Then you realize you have some old wood and a closet shelf that was gonna get tossed so you make a tiny desk and spend (waste?) 15 hours over the weekend that should have been spent on mixing renovating the studio room and moving things and taking measurements till you don\u2019t know what a anything even sounds like anymore . Anyway I feel like a Total psychopath because this is what I did Friday and Saturday all day and night. Desk is obviously in progress and I need to figure out a shelf for the hilo etc. thinking off to the side and low so I can reach it easily but it\u2019s not reflecting stuff. Also the back wall frame is full of pink fluffy now and covered in interm fabric till I figure out what I want it too like like.",

You might be getting even more boundary effect from them being so close to the side walls as well.

Once I got that locked in, I used my Bosch double laser thingy mounted to a tripod to reference to the room centerline and then also cast a horizontal line across the room, across the front of the speaker platform. Since both stands and platforms were now actually level, it was easy to see that the platform of the right speaker stand was slightly out vs. the left. So I had to very gingerly and carefully fuck with the platform to get it lined up. Then fine tuning of leveling with the feet. Then, using the double laser thing at the centerline, I verified the height at the speaker platforms by using that translucent target thing to make sure the cross-line it was casting, hit the target as expected (it did) . I did have to do a bunch of nudging of the right speaker stand to match its position from the right and rear wall to match the left speaker's position, which was a pain int he ass.\n\nDefinitely an ordeal and was made much easier with the tools I have. Pretty satisfying seeing identical measurements from the same reference points on either speaker stand.",

But I can't deny that my heros made great shit on them. There seem to be 2 common denominators I've seen for ns10 people. Either you came up in big studios and they were always there as a reliable reference and you learned them over time. In this context part of the sound of the ns10 is actually the desk reflection. Or you learned from a mentor who worked on them and picked up all the voodoo tricks that helped make them translate. Anybody who had a real mentor likely understands ns10s because they were ubiquitous to genX and before. I'm trying to understand if there's any use to a 25 year old now who's never been in a big studio or had a mentor and wants to do good work. I was the first to discourage someone from getting them yesterday in monitoring. Was my take wrong?",

So I have to pump more sound than before to get the same \"feeling\". Phantom center is also not as clear.\n\nAlso, the idea of getting a triangle gets thrown out the window. I'm further away than they are apart. Bass of course is bigger (even with a -6db roll-off) but I'm not sure if it's actually useful. And it seems like the walls are now vibrating more (already had a neighbor asking what I'm up to).\n\nAnd for some reason records that sounded great to me before now sound unlistenable and harsh in the upper mids. Not sure if this is true just yet though (see Walking on a Dream by Empire of the Sun). If this is what other people are also hearing maybe it's the detail I've been missing in the mids. Some songs are really painful.\n\nOn the plus side, the room is a bit \"deader\" and even now because I moved the treatment to the back (where previously there wasn't much). Also, reverb tails are very clear now. Before I couldn't really hear FX until I overdid them and dialed back. I'll try doing a mix like this and see if I intuitively make better decisions.",

I think you could get better ergonomics and potentially better sound from other studio design options, but the flexibility is great. They are definitely not a magic bullet to get a \u201cflat room\u201d either and placement / quantity can affect things greatly. \n\nAndrew Maury was the one who inspired my initial purchase! He does fantastic work on them and was definitely a great resource as I was looking into them. He shared this video with Greg from Kush audio which was very convincing at the time  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P7pOA4eeuS0&t=72m13s\n\nI also have friends who have had good success building diy tube traps \u2014 which can be pretty affordable.",

Will of course need to adapt as I get in the room and listen, but I'm excited *and* need to minimize downtime between studios, so I'm mapping stuff out as best I can so I can hit the ground running.\n\nI'm thinking I'll build some fiberglass/rockwool panels on stands (the four panels freestanding by the mix position) and mimic some of the idea behind the attack wall: kill reflections closer to the listening position rather than at the walls. This way I can keep the fireplace and windows from being covered up, and have some gobos to move around when needed for tracking. The small desk to the left of the mix position will be a rack for gear, the large rectangular thingy in the upper right will be an upright piano. I'll pack in some DIY tube traps around the monitors, and hang two 4'x2' panels I already own over the mix position. I'll also put two slightly smaller panels over the drums, and two more on the wall behind the drums. The french doors and the sliding doors to the closet behind the couch will have heavy curtains.",

I have a side car off the side (the walls look pretty tight but they are actually the unf*ck mass loaded vinyl L things, so the room opens up more behind them). The sidecar is back from those...its got a apogee symphony taking the ins for my synths (also not really pictured -- just hangarounds from my production days for the fun of it sometimes), Hazelrigg VLC in there too.\n\nThere is sorta a whole room behind the listening position...its 30 feet long with a floating wall for absorption about 15 feet in so the studio is like 13x15 but acoustically its larger if that makes sense.\n\nI do use streamdeck...but mainly to switch quickly between the hot ref in Wavelab and my master. I've gotten deep into Applescript which essentially handles all of the other Wavelab processes...it's almost finished but my streamdeck will essentially just launch those applications to do what I need. So I'd say it's very useful, but the coding I've been able to do will render it sorta meaningless for me (though convienent, I use it for other things like navigating websites when doing client outreach, etc which is very handy and makes my workflow like an order of magnitude quicker).\n\nChair is hag capisco. I love it. Had a serious back injury when I was younger so I'm pretty dialed into having things be ergonomic and I find it's great. Actually kinda rather uncomfortable...in a good way.

There's also a program called freedom (probably similar to focus app mentioned) I just got and will be experimenting with. Have a program called flux that changes the color hue of my screen as the day progresses to make it easier on the eyes. I think blue light earlier in the day and yellow ish light later in the day? Some science I don't really understand behind that. There's a huberman lab out there somewhere about it. I backlit my screen display with blue leds as well. Honestly one of the best things when I actually stick to it is trying to never sit for longer than an hour. Even just a 5 minute stand up walk around helps me immensely.
