    "content": "Hey guys! I am new to the community and happy to have finally taken the jump into the discord after being an avid listener since the beginning.\n\nJust finished building my studio about half a year ago. I run a hybrid setup where everything is always connected and ready to go. All recording paths are accessed via an XLR patch-bay. Mixbus/Mastering gear is controlled by a Dangerous Liaison. Conversion is done via MADI and AES/EBU. Headphone CUE\u2019s are analog and via AVB. I like having everything connected and mic\u2019ed up because I notice that I only use the stuff that I can access quickly while producing/mixing. I went through a lot of trial and error building and working in this studio (been in this location for 1.5 years) so if anyone needs any input I would be happy to help!",

    "content": "Okay here we go\u2026\n\n@ALXCPH found a couple on my camera roll. Excuse quality, one is when I showed my parents the studio for first time. Couple (long) notes\u2026I\u2019m sure @Nomograph Mastering can expand if he chooses:\n\nUnf*ck designed the room. Ruairi you are incredible at this and I\u2019m very grateful. The subtleties in the trade offs when designing a room are something I urge everyone to consider deeply as I learned when working with them!\n\n1. Studio is built in my basement\u202613 feet long x 30 wide x 8 tall (including treatment). Back wall divides it length wise and makes the studio part 12x15 approx.\n\n2. All treatment is built in\u2026entire ceiling is stuffed with 9 inch pink fluffy, couple inch rockwool in the walls, tuned mass loaded vinyl behind the \u201chousings\u201d to L and R of listening position. Back wall is 6 inches of safe n sound in a frame built of 2x8s (by contractor) with a 24\u201d door. It\u2019s standing by friction just slid tight to ceiling. Quite precise measuring required to do that and make it sturdy so a door can open well\n\n3. Since I get asked a lot\u2026the wall finishes are acoustic felt board. Went that direction because install was way better than a fabric wall (they are firm and can be cut with an exacto knife). Also they are absorptive with no reflections\u2026caveats apply if that\u2019s good for a given space though (rather than the acoustically transparent fabric).\n\n5. @BatMeckley can confirm hard front wall was farrrr superior for me. I had a soft one (felt) against Ruairi advice since I preferred the aesthetic lol, but room was too dead. Uncomfortable. When I switched I could hear much more depth and energy but everything still as crisp and clear. Highly recommend! \n\nHope this helps some people on here. FYI we started my room from concrete block, bare bones so could frame things to hold treatment needed.\n\nWill circle back with some better pics when I\u2019m home. This community has helped me greatly.\n\nCheers friends!",

    "content": "I think the attack wall solves the problem for people that can't build their room from scratch. As someone that just built a studio, building fake walls with insulation & membranes tucked behind aint cheap. And it's permanent. Having tube traps (or the ASC pressure traps, or whatever they are) are not a panacea -- but rather a scalable, portable method of getting an untreated room in the ballpark. I've found with tube traps that more is not necessarily better and you just don't know till you get in there and shoot it. My friend Andrew Maury raves about his. He's gets amazing results and he loves moving around his setup every few months just because he likes tweaking... and the attack wall allows him to do this. So -- if you're building a studio from the ground up, there are absolutely better options. But if you're hopping around from space to space and don't feel like spending $10-15k on framing, fabric, rockwool, & building limp mass membranes... these are a terrific option.",

    "content": "It took me about a week to make 28 3ft traps for an attack wall. I did add some diffusion to them with mass loaded vinyl strips on half the surface  so it was a little more involved than the standard tubes. Well worth it though! Like @cian riordan said it\u2019s gonna be itchy, long sleeves, jeans and a mask and gloves will be your friends. Also a cold shower when you\u2019re done. It\u2019ll close up your pores so the fibers can\u2019t work as deep. The longest part of the process was using a jigsaw to cut the wooden caps for each end, this is absolutely needed for the traps to work properly and I\u2019d recommend using a good quality construction adhesive like the gorilla stuff. Tried a bunch of diff ones and that was the only one that could get the job done.",

    "content": "So here\u2019s the roundup on my dumb drum thing. This is a scrappy little experiment on my part to see if I can get a convincing drum sound in my little drum room. Before starting this, I had the idea in my mind that if a room is good for mixing, it must be good for recording! *Insert Game Show Buzzer* I ran into many of the things I didn\u2019t like about the Barefoot Studio B Live room \u2014 and those things were exaggerated by a factor of 10. First of all, my room is very dead by design. It treats me great in mixing, but made for a real challenge when trying to get *some* sort of drum personality. I was also working with a pretty shitty old premier kit that hadn\u2019t seen the light of day in half a decade. Shitty cymbals, very quickly tuned heads \u2014 I wasn\u2019t setting myself up for success\u2026 but whatever.\n\nThe setup was a little ridiculous (minus a few utilitarian pieces):\nKick: Beta 52 -> Scully 280\nSnare: SM57 -> Scully 280\nOH Mono: Coles 4038 -> Ampex 351 -> 1176 (not compressing, just to trim gain before \u2018tools)\nOH L/R: U67s -> UTA pre (thanks Matt!)\nKick Room: U47 -> UTA Pre (again\u2026)\n\nThis is where I ended up, without mixing, and with some quick playing and utility EQ/balancing. No compression except a limiter to bring up the level. While the actual drums themselves don\u2019t sound amazing, I really struggled with getting any sort of energy out of the drums\u2026 it all just got sucked out. \n\nHere are the results if you care (don\u2019t judge my shitty playing)\n\nI think if it do this again I would:\n1) Have a better sounding kit. Turns out, shit in.. shit out. I knew this. We all know this. But here I am.\n2) Maybe put some sheets of plywood around to create some surface in the room. Just give it some life.\n3) Not use the Scully. It\u2019s so hard to get them to not sound distorty\u2026 I just don\u2019t have enough pres on hand to have clean path for everything. Mix studio living.\n\nSo it goes\u2026",

    "content": "I have a Hilo goes AES to speakers and as my send/capture for the Massive Passive...you can't see it here but there is a rack under the screen where it sits. I have a side car off the side (the walls look pretty tight but they are actually the unf*ck mass loaded vinyl L things, so the room opens up more behind them). The sidecar is back from those...its got a apogee symphony taking the ins for my synths (also not really pictured -- just hangarounds from my production days for the fun of it sometimes), Hazelrigg VLC in there too.\n\nThere is sorta a whole room behind the listening position...its 30 feet long with a floating wall for absorption about 15 feet in so the studio is like 13x15 but acoustically its larger if that makes sense.\n\nI do use streamdeck...but mainly to switch quickly between the hot ref in Wavelab and my master. I've gotten deep into Applescript which essentially handles all of the other Wavelab processes...it's almost finished but my streamdeck will essentially just launch those applications to do what I need. So I'd say it's very useful, but the coding I've been able to do will render it sorta meaningless for me (though convienent, I use it for other things like navigating websites when doing client outreach, etc which is very handy and makes my workflow like an order of magnitude quicker).\n\nChair is hag capisco. I love it. Had a serious back injury when I was younger so I'm pretty dialed into having things be ergonomic and I find it's great. Actually kinda rather uncomfortable...in a good way. You can't really slouch. Took some getting used to but it's interesting",

Please just let me know if there\u2019s a better thread for this sort of thing. \n\nI\u2019d be extremely grateful for any feedback! Here\u2019s some info: \n\n- I am currently moving my home studio to this basement space that is about 400 SQ feet. Concrete floor and walls except for the front wall shown in this picture - that is drywall as it separates the rest of the basement. \n\n- The ceiling joists are exposed and are about 7.5\u201d deep. \n\n- My primary function for this room will be mixing, but I will also be doing smaller overdubs like piano and vocals. \n\nCurrently, after painting the walls and floor, my plan is as follows: \n- Stuff the ceiling joists with insulation \u2014 probably Safe N Sound\u2026 thoughts on that choice? \n\n- Cover the joists with fabric from Gilford of Maine. \n\n- Figure out how to drill into concrete \ud83d\ude02 Then put panels everywhere. Most of my panels are about 4\u201d thick and are comprised of the safe n sound insulation. \n- Put some big rugs down but also leave a bit of the concrete exposed if possible cuz I like the look. Haha \n\n- My monitoring set up is NS10M\u2019s (don\u2019t laugh) with an Avantone CLA-100 amp and a PreSonus T10 sub. I\u2019ve got an Apollo 8 Duo and Apollo Twin X Quad. \n\nThat concludes my plan so far. Am I on the right track? \ud83d\ude33 \n\nI really appreciate any feedback you\u2019re willing to give. \ud83d\ude4f",

But it was only separated by a cheap, chincy glass door -- so whenever you'd do drums in there it was always a bit of a guessing game how it really sounded. But it was worth it for the character of the room. I remember when I first started building studios I was so obsessed with trying to get the best isolation... now I'd almost prefer a big open studio with clear sightlines and just use baffles or gobos to do spot isolation on mics.",

I ended up putting a 2 ft wide strip across the front of roxul behind the speakers. I put up some plywood to A/B it when I was finalizing the room and found the imaging to be tighter with a little bit of soft stuff behind the speakers. Now granted, the soft stuff is flush with the wall so the speakers are still as far back as you can go. But just food for thought. I was in another room recently that had great treatment, similar speakers, but a fully bare front wall and I definitely heard a less defined stereo image. Just my experience and preference.",
