> "Waves is in a unique position. They're one of the longest-enduring plugin developers. They still offer and support plugins that people purchased 25 years ago. I remember when individual Waves plugins like RComp cost $300/apiece and entire bundles cost $3,000+."

- Widely used across all DAWs

### SoundToys
Creative effects and character processing:
- M1 compatible (Slow Hand, 2021)
