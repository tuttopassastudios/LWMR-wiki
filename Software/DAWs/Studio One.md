# Studio One

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> PreSonus Studio One is a modern DAW that has gained a growing user base thanks to its intuitive drag-and-drop workflow, built-in [[Melodyne]] integration via ARA, and a streamlined single-window interface. Users frequently cite it as a strong middle ground between the creative flexibility of [[FL Studio]] or [[Ableton Live]] and the professional mixing environment of [[Pro Tools]].

## Detail

### Overview
Studio One was first released in 2009 by PreSonus and has evolved rapidly through major versions. It introduced native [[ARA]] integration with Melodyne before most competitors, making pitch correction a seamless part of the editing workflow. The DAW operates on a song/project paradigm — songs are individual sessions, while projects handle mastering and album assembly in an integrated environment.

### Strengths
- **Drag-and-drop everything** — effects, instruments, audio files, and presets can all be dragged directly onto tracks, channels, or the arrangement
- **Built-in Melodyne** — ARA integration provides pitch editing directly in the timeline without round-tripping
- **Fat Channel** — channel strip modeled after PreSonus digital consoles, offering EQ, compression, and gate per channel
- **Pipeline** — dedicated plugin for hardware inserts with automatic latency compensation
- **Integrated mastering** — the Project page allows mastering an album without leaving the DAW

> "Started with FL and Logic (mainly FL cause I couldn't use a Mac outside of school) then after four or five years switched slowly to Studio One once I wanted to get a bit more 'professional'."

### Limitations
- **Stock instruments** — the bundled virtual instruments are considered weaker than those in [[Logic Pro]] or [[Ableton Live]], pushing users toward third-party plugins
- **Smaller ecosystem** — fewer tutorials, templates, and community resources compared to the larger DAWs
- **Plugin compatibility** — occasional issues with certain third-party plugins, particularly older 32-bit tools
- **Market perception** — still seen by some as a "newcomer" despite over 15 years of development

### Community Sentiment
Studio One users in the community are enthusiastic and often come from [[FL Studio]], [[Logic Pro]], or [[Cubase]] backgrounds. The transition stories highlight the drag-and-drop workflow and Melodyne integration as primary draws. The DAW is particularly popular among independent producers and singer-songwriters who want a professional mixing environment without the learning curve of [[Pro Tools]].

### Integration with Other Tools
- **[[ARA]]** — native support for Melodyne and other ARA-compatible plugins
- **Pipeline** — hardware insert plugin with automatic round-trip latency compensation
- **AAF/OMF** — session exchange with [[Pro Tools]] and other DAWs
- **PreSonus hardware** — tight integration with PreSonus audio interfaces and the StudioLive mixer line

## Practical Application
- Use the Project page for mastering workflows instead of exporting to a separate mastering DAW
- Take advantage of built-in Melodyne for vocal tuning directly in the timeline
- Set up Pipeline for hardware inserts to integrate outboard gear with automatic compensation
- Use the drag-and-drop browser to audition and load effects, instruments, and presets quickly
- Invest in quality third-party instruments to supplement the stock library

## Common Mistakes
- Ignoring the Project page — it is one of Studio One's unique advantages for mastering
- Not setting up Pipeline correctly for hardware inserts, leading to latency issues
- Expecting the stock instrument library to compete with [[Logic Pro]]'s bundled content
- Not exploring the macro and shortcut customization options available in the DAW
