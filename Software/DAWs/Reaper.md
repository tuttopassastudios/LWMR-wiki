## Weaknesses (Community Consensus)
- **Learning curve** — requires significant setup time to be productive
- **UI/UX** — default interface is less polished than competitors; "an over-optimized GUI nightmare" (Slow Hand, jokingly)
- **Smaller professional adoption** — rarely required for studio positions
- **Setup investment** — need to customize extensively before matching other DAWs' out-of-box workflows

## Mixing Workflow
- Fully customizable routing and channel configuration
- JS plugins (built-in scripting effects) for custom processing
- SWS extensions add significant mixing functionality
- Flexible track types — any track can be audio, MIDI, or both

## Recording Workflow
- Excellent for vocal production, recording, and mixing (ALXCPH)
- Lane-based comping
- Flexible I/O routing for complex recording setups
