# Cubase

## Summary
> [!abstract]
> Cubase (and its sibling Nuendo) is Steinberg's professional DAW, recognized in the community for superior export/render workflows, excellent MIDI sequencing, VariAudio pitch editing, and strong video/post-production capabilities (especially Nuendo). Community members who use Cubase often come from post-production backgrounds or value its detailed stem export features.

## Strengths (Community Consensus)
- **Export/render workflow** — considered superior to Ableton's; export features are a noted strength (austenballard)
- **Routing flexibility** — right-click to create aux/buses with naming, considered easier than other DAWs (mixedbywong_my)
- **MIDI sequencing** — detailed sequencing capabilities, custom instrument note-mappings in piano roll (Slow Hand)
- **VariAudio** — built-in pitch editing comparable to Melodyne
- **Video support** — Cubase Pro handles multiple videos; Nuendo is a post-production standard (mixedbywong_my)
- **Direct Offline Processing** — flexible offline effect rendering
- **Control Room** — advanced monitoring and output routing

> "Mixing in Cubase seems easier in terms of routing and creating buses. Just right click and make new aux/buses and rename before it's created."

## Weaknesses (Community Consensus)
- **Steinberg Download Manager** — installer/manager app frustrates users (Will Melones)
- **Smaller community** — fewer users in the community compared to Pro Tools and Ableton
- **Learning curve** — dense feature set can be overwhelming
- **Perpetual license cost** — more expensive upfront than Logic

## Mixing Workflow
- Traditional mixer with flexible bus/aux creation
- Control Room feature for advanced monitoring setups
- Direct Offline Processing for non-destructive offline rendering
- Comprehensive automation system

## Recording Workflow
- Lane-based comping system
- Multiple video track support (Cubase Pro and Nuendo)
- Strong for post-production workflows where video sync is critical

> "If you're working with videos, you need a DAW that'll handle multiple videos. Logic can't do it. Only PT Ultimate lets you do more than 1 video track. Cubase Pro/Nuendo handles multiple videos."

## Key Features
- **VariAudio** — integrated pitch correction and editing
- **Direct Offline Processing** — apply and manage offline effects non-destructively
- **Control Room** — sophisticated monitoring section with multiple outputs
- **Expression Maps** — custom instrument articulation mapping for the piano roll (Slow Hand)
- **Nuendo** — extended version with additional post-production features

> "I like the way you can make custom instrument note-mappings for the piano roll in Cubase. It's so helpful when using sampler instruments that use key-switching to change instrument articulations."

## Known Issues
- Download manager and licensing system considered cumbersome (Will Melones)
- Smaller user base means fewer community resources and tutorials

## Community Tips
- Nuendo is the better choice for audio post-production and sound design
- Cubase Pro required for multiple video tracks
- Consider Cubase if coming from a post-production background or if export workflow is a priority
