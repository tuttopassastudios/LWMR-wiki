# Lexicon

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Lexicon reverbs are among the most iconic effects processors in recording history. With 14 mentions across 7 threads, the community discusses the various PCM series hardware units (PCM 70, 80/81, 90/91) and the classic 224. These algorithmic reverbs define the sound of countless records. The hardware units are valued as "preset machines" since their button-based interfaces don't lend themselves to real-time tweaking. The PCM 60 is noted as the reverb heard on Notorious B.I.G. records.

## Key Characteristics

- **PCM 70**: Mono to stereo; classic
- **PCM 80/81**: Stereo; step up from 70
- **PCM 90/91**: Higher-end stereo reverb
- **PCM 60**: "The Wallace one" — associated with Notorious B.I.G.
- **224**: Legendary studio reverb; Chase Bliss made a pedal version
- **LXP-1**: Affordable entry-level Lexicon hardware
- Button-based interfaces make them best used as preset machines
- Hardware units range from affordable (LXP-1) to expensive vintage pieces
- "They all pretty much rip" across the PCM line

## Use Cases

- Studio reverb processing — the definitive algorithmic reverb sound
- Preset-based reverb selection during mixing
- Hardware delay (LXP-1 and similar units)
- Signature reverb on vocal tracks and instruments

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Best used as dedicated preset machines — pick a preset and commit
- PCM units pair well with other rack effects in a studio setup
- Not ideal for real-time parameter tweaking due to button-based interface

## Comparable Alternatives

| Product | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| [[Eventide]] SP2016 | Different algorithmic reverb character |
| Valhalla VintageVerb | Affordable plugin alternative inspired by classic algorithms |
| [[UAD Plugins]] Lexicon emulations | Software versions of Lexicon algorithms |
| Yamaha SPX90 | Budget rack effects alternative |
| Strymon BigSky | Modern reverb pedal with classic algorithm types |

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting to tweak Lexicon rack units in real time like a plugin — they work best as preset machines
- Not considering that any Lexicon PCM unit will sound good — "they all pretty much rip"
- Overlooking the LXP-1 as an affordable entry into hardware Lexicon reverb
