# Eventide

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Eventide is a legendary audio company known for pioneering digital effects processing. With 24 mentions across 17 threads, the community discusses both their hardware (H9 pedal, H9000 rack, classic SP2016 reverb) and plugin emulations. The SP2016 reverb is described as a "desert island reverb," while the H3000 harmonizer is used for chorus and pitch-shifting effects. The company has a mixed reputation regarding support — one member paid $700 for a plugin that lost support, while others praise the hardware's versatility.

## Key Characteristics

- **SP2016 / 2016 reverb**: Iconic algorithmic reverb; "desert island reverb" (cian riordan)
- **H3000**: Classic harmonizer; used for chorus, pitch shifting, and widening effects
- **H9**: Versatile multi-effects pedal; recommended as modular synth companion
- **H9000**: Professional rack-mount multi-effects processor
- **Omnipressor**: Legendary dynamics processor with plugin emulation
- Legacy of pioneering digital effects processing
- Mixed support history — discontinued plugin support has burned some users

## Use Cases

- Reverb processing (SP2016 algorithms)
- Chorus and widening effects (H3000)
- Modular synth effects pairing (H9 pedal)
- Creative dynamics processing (Omnipressor)
- Studio and live effects processing (H9000)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- SP2016: Second preset often works immediately on BGVs — "grabbed the second preset I flipped to, perfect on BGVs, moved on"
- H3000: Effective for chorus/widening on synths, guitars, and overdubs
- H9: Pairs particularly well with small modular synth setups

## Comparable Alternatives

| Product | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| [[Lexicon]] | Alternative classic algorithmic reverb |
| Valhalla plugins | Affordable reverb alternatives |
| Strymon pedals | Alternative effects pedals for modular/guitar |
| Chase Bliss pedals | "Tried and tested pairings with modular synths" |
| OTO BIM/BAM | Boutique delay/reverb alternatives |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying expensive Eventide plugins without checking long-term support commitment
- Not exploring the H9 as a studio tool — it's not just for guitarists
- Overlooking that Eventide has dropped support for previously expensive plugins
