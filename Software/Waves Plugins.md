# Waves Plugins

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Waves is one of the largest and most ubiquitous plugin manufacturers, with 94 mentions across 60 threads. The community has a complicated relationship with Waves — many members use specific Waves plugins daily (J37 tape, MV2, CLA series) while criticizing the company's licensing practices and frequent sales that devalue their products. The licensing is tied to MAC addresses, creating issues when changing computers.

## Key Characteristics

- Massive plugin library covering virtually every processing category
- J37 tape machine emulation is a long-time favorite for tape saturation
- MV2 upward/downward compressor has specific fans
- Frequent deep sales — plugins often available at 80-90% off
- Licensing tied to MAC address of computer motherboard
- Must deauthorize before trading in/selling computer — "they won't release those licenses for you once you give up the computer"
- Can keep licenses on a USB drive as alternative

## Use Cases

- Tape machine emulation (J37)
- Dynamic processing (MV2, CLA compressors)
- Broad utility across mixing workflows
- Budget-friendly plugin collection building during sales

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- J37: Long-time go-to for tape machine emulation in the mix
- MV2: Quick upward compression for vocals and instruments
- Watch for sales — "pay attention to their IG they put it on sale all the time"

## Comparable Alternatives

| Plugin | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [[UAD Plugins]] | Higher-end emulations; different ecosystem |
| [[FabFilter]] | Better UI/workflow; different philosophy |
| [[Plugin Alliance]] | Growing alternative ecosystem |
| [[Slate Digital]] | Subscription model covers many similar tools |
| [[Soundtoys]] | More character/creative effects |

## Common Mistakes

- Not deauthorizing Waves licenses before trading in your computer
- Buying plugins at full price when deep sales happen regularly
- Not keeping licenses on a physical USB drive for portability

## Mixing Context (from #mixing-talk)

In #mixing-talk (2,441 plugin discussion messages), Waves plugins are discussed with the community's characteristic mix of appreciation and frustration:
- **Specific plugins still valued:** Despite the brand's reputation issues, specific Waves tools (J37 tape, MV2, CLA compressors, H-Delay) remain in many members' mixing workflows
- **H-Delay for mixing:** Used for slapback and timed delays in vocal mixing chains
- **"Don't buy at full price" consensus:** The community universally advises waiting for sales, which happen frequently and deeply discount individual plugins
