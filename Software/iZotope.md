# iZotope

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> iZotope is best known for Ozone (mastering suite) and RX (audio repair). With 37 mentions across 29 threads, the community discusses Ozone's mastering tools extensively. Ozone's IRC IV maximizer in transient mode is considered by some to be the definitive final limiter. The tape emulator, stabilizer module, and soft clipper are highlighted as strong features. The AI mastering assistant generates mixed reactions — impressively accurate but philosophically debated.

## Key Characteristics

- **Ozone**: Mastering suite with limiter, EQ, dynamics, tape emulation, and AI assistant
- **IRC IV Maximizer** (transient mode): "Absolute beast" as final limiter
- **Ozone tape emulator**: Effective for mix bus tape saturation
- **Stabilizer**: Like "soothe/spiff and Gullfoss had a child" — spectral dynamic processing
- **Soft Clipper**: Praised as potentially "my favorite clipper I've ever used" with light/medium/hard modes
- **AI Mastering Assistant**: "REALLY good" but debated philosophically
- **RX**: Industry standard for audio repair and noise reduction
- Spectral recovery for distortion is a valued feature

## Use Cases

- Mastering chain (Ozone suite)
- Final limiting (IRC IV Maximizer in transient mode)
- Mix bus tape saturation (Ozone tape emulator)
- Spectral dynamic processing (Stabilizer)
- Soft clipping before final limiter
- Audio repair and restoration (RX)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- IRC IV Maximizer in transient mode as final limiter
- Stabilizer with careful application — "transparency of ozone's spectral shaper module"
- Soft clipper: light mode for subtle peak management, hard mode for aggressive clipping
- Tape emulator on mix bus as alternative to dedicated tape plugins

## Comparable Alternatives

| Plugin | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [[FabFilter]] Pro-L | Alternative limiter |
| Gullfoss | Stabilizer is described as an improvement over Gullfoss |
| Soothe 2 | Different approach to spectral processing |
| [[Slate Digital]] FG-X | Alternative mastering limiter |
| StandardClip | Alternative clipper |

## Common Mistakes

- Relying on AI mastering assistant for client work without critical evaluation
- Overusing the Impact (transient shaper) module — "just not doing anything I couldn't already do before"
- Using Stabilizer too aggressively — it can "smear the sound"
- Buying at full price — significant discounts available during sales and crossgrade options

## Mastering Context (from #mastering-talk)

iZotope Ozone is the most frequently mentioned mastering tool in #mastering-talk (206+ mentions across 22,909 messages). The community has a nuanced view:

- **Ozone as a learning tool:** Widely recommended for developing mastering engineers as a way to learn signal flow and hear what different processing does
- **IRC modes:** The IRC (Intelligent Release Control) limiter modes are actively discussed, with different modes suited to different material — IRC IV in transient mode is considered the most transparent
- **"Ozone preset jockeys" critique:** Professional mastering engineers criticize over-reliance on presets and the AI mastering assistant; Nomograph Mastering uses this term to describe engineers who apply presets without developing critical listening
- **Specific modules praised:** Soft Clipper, tape emulator, and Stabilizer are highlighted as strong individual modules that rival dedicated plugins
- **AI mastering assistant:** Generates mixed reactions — impressively accurate for ballpark settings, but philosophically debated for client work
