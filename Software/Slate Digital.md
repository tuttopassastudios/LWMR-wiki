# Slate Digital

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Slate Digital encompasses both a plugin subscription service and hardware (Slate Pro Audio). With 68 mentions across 51 threads, Slate is discussed in two distinct contexts: the VTM (Virtual Tape Machine) plugin was a long-time community favorite for mix bus tape saturation, and the Slate Pro Audio Dragon compressor is praised as offering exceptional value compared to UA 1176 reissues. Steven Slate's approach of offering affordable alternatives to expensive hardware resonates with the community.

## Key Characteristics

- **Slate VTM**: Virtual Tape Machine plugin; long-time mix bus tape saturation standard
- **Slate Pro Audio Dragon**: Hardware 1176-style compressor; "100000x more bang for your buck" vs UA reissue
- Subscription model (All Access Pass) provides broad plugin access
- Mix bus processing tools (VTM, FG-X limiter) are the most discussed
- Plugin quality has improved significantly over the years

## Use Cases

- Mix bus tape saturation (VTM)
- Hardware compression (Dragon as affordable 1176 alternative)
- Subscription-based access to a wide range of processing tools
- Tracking chain alternatives to expensive vintage hardware

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- VTM on the mix bus for tape saturation character
- Dragon can be set to sound "exactly like the UA reissue if you want it to"

## Comparable Alternatives

| Plugin/Gear | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| [[UAD Plugins]] | Higher-end emulations; more expensive per plugin |
| [[Waves Plugins]] | Similar breadth; different business model |
| [[Acustica Audio]] | Convolution-based alternative; more CPU-intensive |
| Goodhertz Tupe | Alternative tape saturation plugin |
| Universal Audio 1176 (hardware) | The original that the Dragon emulates |

## Common Mistakes

- Dismissing Slate Pro Audio hardware because of the "Slate" name association with budget plugins
- Not considering the Dragon before spending $2,500+ on a UA 1176 reissue
- Overlooking VTM in favor of newer tape emulation plugins
