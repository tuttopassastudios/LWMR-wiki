# Soundtoys

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Soundtoys is a highly regarded effects plugin developer with 31 mentions across 26 threads. Their plugins are known for character, musicality, and ease of use. Decapitator (saturation), Microshift (stereo widening), and EchoBoy (delay) are the most frequently mentioned. The Decapitator's default 'A' setting is modeled after the [[Ampex Tape Machines|Ampex 351]], making it one of the most used saturation plugins in the community.

## Key Characteristics

- **Decapitator**: Analog saturation modeler; default 'A' setting based on Ampex 351
- **Microshift**: Stereo widening via pitch shifting; "heavy chorus abuser" tool
- **EchoBoy**: Versatile delay with multiple echo styles
- **Effect Rack**: Combines multiple Soundtoys effects in a single interface
- Part of the "essentials" plugin set alongside FabFilter, Valhalla, and Arturia
- Plugins prioritize musical character over clinical precision

## Use Cases

- Saturation and distortion (Decapitator)
- Stereo widening on vocals and instruments (Microshift)
- Creative delay effects (EchoBoy)
- Vocal processing (Little AlterBoy for pitch/format shifting)
- Guitar and synth effects processing

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Decapitator 'A' mode for Ampex-style saturation
- Microshift on background vocal bus for width and blend
- EchoBoy for styled delay effects across genres

## Comparable Alternatives

| Plugin | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [[UAD Plugins]] | Hardware emulations with different character |
| Valhalla plugins | Complementary reverb/modulation effects |
| [[Plugin Alliance]] | Various saturation and effects alternatives |
| Goodhertz plugins | Similar "musical character" philosophy |
| Arturia FX Collection | "Don't sleep on Arturia FX, shit is inspiring" |

## Common Mistakes

- Not exploring beyond Decapitator — the full Soundtoys bundle has many versatile tools
- Using Microshift as a substitute for proper stereo technique instead of a complement
- Paying full price — significant sales happen regularly

## Mixing Context (from #mixing-talk)

In #mixing-talk, Soundtoys plugins are discussed within the saturation (1,930 messages) and reverb/delay (1,796 messages) categories:
- **Decapitator as mixing saturation:** Used on vocals, drums, bass, and the mix bus for adding warmth and harmonics. The 'A' mode (Ampex 351 model) remains the community favorite
- **EchoBoy as primary delay:** The community's most recommended delay plugin for mixing -- slapback, timed delays, and creative effects
- **Saturn 2 for bus saturation:** Multiband saturation on buses allows frequency-targeted harmonic enhancement -- discussed as an alternative to full-band tape emulation
