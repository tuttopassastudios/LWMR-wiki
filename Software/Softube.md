# Softube

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Softube is a Swedish plugin developer with 28 mentions across 17 threads, known for high-quality hardware emulations and the Console 1 hardware/software mixing system. Their plugins are available in both native and UAD formats. The Model 72 (Minimoog emulation) is praised for synth duties, while their compressor emulations (CL1B, Summit TLA-100) are valued mixing tools. Native and UAD versions are functionally identical.

## Key Characteristics

- **Model 72**: Minimoog emulation; "does the Minimoog thing very well"
- **CL1B emulation**: Tube-Tech optical compressor plugin
- **Summit TLA-100 emulation**: Popular compressor plugin
- **Console 1**: Hardware mixing controller with integrated plugin chain
- **Weiss series**: Mastering-grade processing
- Available in both native and UAD formats — "should be identical as long as it's the same plugin/version"
- Consistently high build quality across the plugin line

## Use Cases

- Minimoog-style synthesis (Model 72)
- Vocal compression (CL1B, Summit TLA-100)
- Complete mixing workflow via Console 1
- Mastering processing (Weiss series)

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Model 72 for production requiring Moog-style bass and lead sounds
- CL1B on vocals for smooth optical compression
- Console 1 for tactile mixing workflow

## Comparable Alternatives

| Plugin | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [[UAD Plugins]] | Same plugins often available in both ecosystems |
| [[Acustica Audio]] | Convolution-based alternative; more CPU-heavy |
| Arturia Mini V | Alternative Minimoog emulation |
| [[Plugin Alliance]] | Various compressor emulations |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying the UAD version when the native version sounds identical and doesn't require UA hardware
- Not exploring the full Softube lineup beyond the well-known compressor emulations
