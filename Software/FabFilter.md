# FabFilter

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> FabFilter is a widely used plugin suite known for its clean, precise processing and excellent user interfaces. With 38 mentions across 21 threads, Pro-Q (EQ), Pro-C (compressor), and Pro-L (limiter) are staples in many workflows. However, the community has a notable split: some members argue FabFilter's EQ is objectively inferior to alternatives like Kirchhoff or Equilibrium, while others maintain that "the choices made with an EQ matter more than the specific EQ being used."

## Key Characteristics

- **Pro-Q**: Industry-standard parametric EQ with exceptional visual feedback
- **Pro-C**: Versatile compressor with multiple compression styles
- **Pro-L**: Popular limiter for mastering and mix bus
- Excellent user interfaces and visual feedback — best-in-class for surgical work
- "Clean" processing philosophy — transparent by design
- Cross-platform compatibility and stability

## Use Cases

- Surgical EQ work requiring visual precision
- General-purpose compression across the mix
- Mastering chain (Pro-L limiter, Pro-Q for precision EQ)
- System essentials that "just work" across all DAWs

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Pro-Q dynamic EQ bands for transparent problem-solving
- Pro-L for final limiting in mastering chain
- Linear phase mode in Pro-Q for mix bus applications

## Comparable Alternatives

| Plugin | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Kirchhoff EQ | "Splitting hairs" between Kirchhoff and Equilibrium; Rob Domos considers it superior to FabFilter |
| Tokyo Dawn Equilibrium | Another high-quality alternative |
| [[UAD Plugins]] | Hardware-modeled EQs offer different character |
| [[Plugin Alliance]] | Various EQ options with more analog character |

## Common Mistakes

- Using FabFilter EQ when a more characterful EQ would better serve the source material
- Over-relying on visual feedback instead of trusting ears
- Not exploring alternatives that may offer better sonic results despite less polished UIs

## Mixing Context (from #mixing-talk)

In #mixing-talk (2,441 plugin discussion messages, 2,247 EQ messages), FabFilter plugins are among the most frequently referenced:
- **Pro-Q3 as spectral analyzer:** cian riordan's tip (27 reactions) -- setting Pro-Q3's sidechain to display the lead vocal bus spectrum while EQing other tracks, allowing visual frequency comparison
- **Dynamic EQ bands:** Pro-Q3's dynamic EQ functionality is the community's preferred tool for surgical, frequency-specific compression -- preferred over multiband compressors for precision work
- **Pro-C2 versatility:** Multiple compression styles in one plugin, with the community favoring it for transparent bus compression when hardware isn't available
- **Pro-L2 for limiting:** Slow Hand's pinned link to a Pro-L2 analysis demonstrates the community's detailed investigation of limiter behavior

## Mastering Context (from #mastering-talk)

In #mastering-talk (22,909 messages), FabFilter Pro-L is one of the most referenced final limiters alongside iZotope Ozone's Maximizer:

- **Pro-L as mastering limiter:** Widely used as a final limiter in mastering chains; multiple professional mastering engineers include it in their workflow
- **Pro-Q in mastering:** Used for surgical and corrective EQ, though some engineers prefer more characterful EQs (Equilibrium, Kirchhoff) for mastering due to FabFilter's intentionally transparent sound
- **Pro-L ceiling debate:** The community discusses setting true peak ceiling at -1.0 dBTP vs lower values; Rollmottle argues for lower ceilings to prevent intersample peaks during codec conversion
