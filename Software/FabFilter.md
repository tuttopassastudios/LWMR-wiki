# FabFilter

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> FabFilter is a widely used plugin suite known for its clean, precise processing and excellent user interfaces. With 38 mentions across 21 threads, Pro-Q (EQ), Pro-C (compressor), and Pro-L (limiter) are staples in many workflows. However, the community has a notable split: some members argue FabFilter's EQ is objectively inferior to alternatives like Kirchhoff or Equilibrium, while others maintain that "the choices made with an EQ matter more than the specific EQ being used."

## Key Characteristics

- **Pro-Q**: Industry-standard parametric EQ with exceptional visual feedback
- **Pro-C**: Versatile compressor with multiple compression styles
- **Pro-L**: Popular limiter for mastering and mix bus
- Excellent user interfaces and visual feedback — best-in-class for surgical work
- "Clean" processing philosophy — transparent by design
- Cross-platform compatibility and stability

## Use Cases

- Surgical EQ work requiring visual precision
- General-purpose compression across the mix
- Mastering chain (Pro-L limiter, Pro-Q for precision EQ)
- System essentials that "just work" across all DAWs

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Pro-Q dynamic EQ bands for transparent problem-solving
- Pro-L for final limiting in mastering chain
- Linear phase mode in Pro-Q for mix bus applications

## Comparable Alternatives

| Plugin | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Kirchhoff EQ | "Splitting hairs" between Kirchhoff and Equilibrium; Rob Domos considers it superior to FabFilter |
| Tokyo Dawn Equilibrium | Another high-quality alternative |
| [[UAD Plugins]] | Hardware-modeled EQs offer different character |
| [[Plugin Alliance]] | Various EQ options with more analog character |

## Common Mistakes

- Using FabFilter EQ when a more characterful EQ would better serve the source material
- Over-relying on visual feedback instead of trusting ears
- Not exploring alternatives that may offer better sonic results despite less polished UIs
