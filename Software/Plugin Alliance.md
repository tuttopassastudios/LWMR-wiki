# Plugin Alliance

## Summary

> [!abstract]
> Plugin Alliance is a distribution platform and developer collective (primarily Brainworx) with 14 mentions across 12 threads. They offer a wide range of plugins including hardware emulations, creative effects, and mixing tools. The Boss chorus emulation and ADA flanger are specifically called out by community members. Licensing can be kept on a USB drive for portability, which is recommended by members who have dealt with computer transitions.

## Key Characteristics

- Large catalog of plugins from multiple developers under one platform
- **Boss chorus emulation**: Praised by community members
- **ADA flanger**: Described as "fucking silly" (in a good way) for heavy-handed modulation
- Licensing supports USB drive storage for portability
- Subscription model available alongside individual purchases
- Regular sales with significant discounts

## Use Cases

- Chorus and modulation effects (Boss chorus, ADA flanger)
- Hardware emulation across mixing chain
- Supplementary plugins to fill gaps in existing collections
- Portable license management via USB

## Settings & Sweet Spots

- Boss chorus on guitars and background vocals
- ADA flanger for dramatic modulation effects
- Keep licenses on a physical USB drive for easy computer transitions

## Comparable Alternatives

| Plugin | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [[UAD Plugins]] | Higher-end emulations; different ecosystem |
| [[Waves Plugins]] | Similar breadth; different pricing model |
| [[Soundtoys]] | More character-focused effects |
| [[Softube]] | Alternative hardware emulation developer |
| Arturia FX Collection | Alternative creative effects suite |

## Common Mistakes

- Not keeping Plugin Alliance licenses on a USB drive — makes computer transitions painful
- Missing sales — significant discounts happen frequently
- Not deauthorizing before trading in computers
