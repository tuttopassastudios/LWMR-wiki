I ve printed with & with out the insert (with the hardware bypassed) & calculated the sample difference (1746 samples to be exact) which results to 36.375 ms delay. I then add this value to the H/W insert delay matrix, but when I record the insert it is still delayed.  Has anyone any hind about this ? I am probably doing something wrong.",

Sending to a return from a nested track (\"drum rack\" within =DRUMS= here) is slightly delayed and causes phase, but sending from the parent track =DRUMS= is fine. Means parallels will have to be done per track, using Audio Effect Racks, but that's pretty fine in most real life instances.",
