    "message_content": "This takes a bit of work but if you have O-C tendencies like I do, it's a few hours well spent. I made .vstpreset files for every plugin I use (and .adv preset files for stock devices) and organized them like so. I keep an 'Unused' folder in each subfolder so I can quickly access something I don't use regularly, but also keep my usual choices pared down and easy to find. Also I have a separate color grouping for 'favorites'. I've done a similar layout in the Logic plugin manager.",
