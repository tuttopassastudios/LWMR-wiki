# Session View

## Definition

One of two primary views in [[Ableton Live]] (alongside Arrangement View). Session View presents a grid of clip slots organized by track, allowing non-linear, clip-based triggering and arrangement. It is designed for improvisation, live performance, and sketching ideas without committing to a linear timeline.

## Context

Session View is a key differentiator for Ableton Live compared to other DAWs, which typically only offer a linear arrangement/timeline view. In Session View, users launch clips independently or in groups (scenes), making it ideal for live performance, DJ sets, and creative production workflows.

### Key Features
- **Clip slots** — each track has a vertical column of slots that can hold audio or MIDI clips, triggered independently
- **Scenes** — horizontal rows of clips that can be launched simultaneously for structured live performance
- **Follow actions** — automated clip sequencing rules (e.g., play next clip after 4 bars) for generative/evolving arrangements
- **Recording into Arrangement** — users can improvise in Session View while recording the output into Arrangement View, capturing a live performance as a linear arrangement

### Workflow Considerations
- Session View is preferred for **idea generation and sketching** — quickly auditioning combinations of loops, beats, and parts
- Arrangement View is preferred for **final arrangement and mixing** — linear timeline with precise automation
- Many producers start in Session View and record their arrangement performance into Arrangement View
- Live performance sets are typically built entirely in Session View with scene launches and follow actions
