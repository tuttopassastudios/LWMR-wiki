# Logical Editor

## Definition

A powerful MIDI and project manipulation tool built into [[Cubase]]. The **Logical Editor** operates on MIDI data within a part (filtering, transforming, and generating MIDI events), while the **Project Logical Editor (PLE)** operates at the project level (selecting, hiding, soloing, and manipulating tracks, parts, and events across the entire session).

## Context

The Logical Editor is widely considered one of Cubase's killer features, enabling batch MIDI operations, custom macro building, and advanced MIDI transformations that other DAWs cannot replicate without scripting. Community experts LAPhill and SoundsLikeJoe maintain extensive preset libraries covering MIDI velocity curves, note filtering, CC manipulation, and track organization. Jeff Dunne integrates Logical Editor presets with Stream Deck for one-touch macro execution. Greg Ondo (Steinberg) has shared community presets as a starting point for new users.

Common use cases include:
- Batch-editing MIDI velocity curves across multiple parts
- Filtering specific MIDI CC data
- Selecting all notes in a specific range
- Track visibility presets (show/hide by name, color, or type)
- Automating repetitive session organization tasks
