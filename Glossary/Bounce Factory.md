# Bounce Factory

## Definition

A [[SoundFlow]]-based stem bouncing and export automation tool for [[Pro Tools]] that automates the tedious process of soloing, bouncing, and naming individual stems from a session.

## Context

Bounce Factory is one of the most discussed SoundFlow tools in the #pro-tools channel. kylem documented a detailed 6-step workflow using Bounce Factory for stem delivery. Tristan, a SoundFlow power user, compared Bounce Factory against custom SoundFlow scripts he wrote for stem printing — noting that custom scripts offer more flexibility for specific workflows but Bounce Factory is the easier entry point. The tool is part of the broader SoundFlow ecosystem and requires a SoundFlow subscription. Alternatives include Forte (a newer export tool reported as promising but buggier) and fully custom SoundFlow scripts. See also Nic's Logic Bouncer for the equivalent Logic Pro tool built on SoundFlow.
