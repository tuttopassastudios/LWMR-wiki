# AU

## Definition

Audio Units, Apple's native audio plugin format for macOS. Used by [[Logic Pro]] as its sole plugin format, and supported alongside [[VST]] by [[Ableton Live]] and [[Reaper]] on Mac.

## Context

AU plugins are exclusive to macOS. [[Logic Pro]] requires all third-party plugins to be in AU format. During the Apple Silicon transition, AU plugins needed to be recompiled for M1-native support, as Logic Pro did not support running under Rosetta.
