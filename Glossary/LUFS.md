# LUFS

## Definition

Loudness Units relative to Full Scale — a standardized measurement of perceived audio loudness used for streaming platform targets (typically -14 LUFS for Spotify/Apple Music).

## Context

LUFS has become the primary loudness metric in modern mastering workflows, replacing peak-based measurements for delivery compliance. Streaming platforms normalize playback volume based on integrated LUFS values, meaning tracks mastered significantly louder than the target are turned down rather than gaining a competitive advantage. Most mastering limiters and metering plugins display LUFS readings (short-term, momentary, and integrated).
