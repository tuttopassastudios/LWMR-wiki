# MIDI Controller

## Definition

Hardware device that sends MIDI data to control software instruments, DAW parameters, or other MIDI-compatible gear. Includes keyboards, pad controllers, and knob/fader units.

## Context

MIDI controllers are fundamental input devices for DAW-based music production, allowing performers to play virtual instruments and control parameters in real time. Common examples include keyboard controllers (Akai MPK, Arturia KeyLab), pad controllers (Akai MPC, Native Instruments Maschine), and hybrid units combining keys, pads, and encoders.
