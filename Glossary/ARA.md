# ARA

## Definition

Audio Random Access — a plugin extension protocol that allows deep integration between DAWs and audio editing tools like [[Melodyne]] and [[iZotope RX]], enabling direct editing of audio within the DAW timeline.

## Context

ARA (now in its ARA 2 iteration) eliminates the need for offline rendering or real-time capture when using compatible editors. With ARA, a plugin like [[Melodyne]] can directly access the audio file on the DAW timeline, display its own editing interface inline, and apply changes non-destructively. ARA 2 is supported by [[Pro Tools]], [[Logic Pro]], [[Cubase]], [[Studio One]], and [[Reaper]], among others.
