# Time Stretch

## Definition

The process of changing the duration of an audio signal without affecting its pitch, used for tempo matching, creative effects, and audio quantization.

## Context

Time stretching is a core capability in every modern DAW, implemented through various algorithms optimized for different material types (drums, vocals, polyphonic content). Each DAW has its own implementation — [[Pro Tools]] uses [[Elastic Audio]], Ableton Live uses [[Warp Mode|Warp]], Logic Pro uses Flex Time, and Cubase uses AudioWarp. Algorithm quality varies, and extreme time stretching introduces audible artifacts that can be used creatively or avoided depending on the application.
