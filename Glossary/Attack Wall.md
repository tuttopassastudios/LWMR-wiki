# Attack Wall

## Definition

A configuration of [[ASC Tube Trap|ASC tube traps]] arranged around the mix position to create a controlled acoustic environment. The attack wall typically consists of tube traps placed behind, beside, and sometimes above the listener, forming a portable "room within a room" that provides consistent monitoring conditions regardless of the room's acoustic properties.

## Context

The attack wall concept is significant in the community as a solution for engineers who rent studio space or frequently work in different rooms. jantrit's DIY attack wall is one of the most referenced builds in #show-your-setup — he built a portable version for his rented space that "changed my mixing life absolutely" and allowed him to hear his Adam A7X monitors clearly for the first time in 11 years of use across 6 different rooms.

The community also discusses attack walls humorously — cian riordan jokes about discount codes for "an Attack Wall, a Trinnov, and a handgun" — but the underlying consensus is that portable treatment is a legitimate professional solution.

I didn't want to invest in a proper build out and lose the space so everything here can be packed up and moved if need be." — jantrit, #show-your-setup, 2021-08-07
