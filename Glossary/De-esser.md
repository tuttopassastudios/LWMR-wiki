# De-esser

## Definition

Audio processor that reduces sibilance (harsh "s" and "sh" sounds) in vocal recordings by applying frequency-specific dynamic compression, typically in the 4-10kHz range.

## Context

De-essers are a standard part of vocal processing chains in DAW mixing workflows. They can operate in wideband mode (compressing the entire signal when sibilance is detected) or split-band mode (only compressing the targeted frequency range). Common de-esser plugins include FabFilter Pro-DS, Waves DeEsser, and stock de-essers included in most DAWs.
