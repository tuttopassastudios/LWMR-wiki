# VCA

## Definition

Voltage Controlled Amplifier. In modern DAWs, a VCA fader controls the output level of assigned tracks without creating an audio routing path. Unlike a [[Bus]] or [[Aux Track]], a VCA adjusts the fader positions of its member tracks proportionally, preserving individual track send levels and automation relationships.

## Context

VCA faders originated on large-format analog consoles as a way to group-control channel levels without summing the audio. In DAWs, VCAs are available in [[Pro Tools]], [[Cubase]], [[Logic Pro]], and others. They are particularly useful for controlling group levels (e.g., all drum tracks) while maintaining each track's individual send levels to reverb and delay buses.
