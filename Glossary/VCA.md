# VCA

## Definition

Voltage Controlled Amplifier. In modern DAWs, a VCA fader controls the output level of assigned tracks without creating an audio routing path. Unlike a [[Bus]] or [[Aux Track]], a VCA adjusts the fader positions of its member tracks proportionally, preserving individual track send levels and automation relationships.

## Context

VCA faders originated on large-format analog consoles as a way to group-control channel levels without summing the audio. In DAWs, VCAs are available in [[Pro Tools]], [[Cubase]], [[Logic Pro]], and others. They are particularly useful for controlling group levels (e.g., all drum tracks) while maintaining each track's individual send levels to reverb and delay buses.

## VCA Compressors (from #mixing-talk)

In #mixing-talk, "VCA" also refers to a **compressor topology** — Voltage Controlled Amplifier compressors. The [[SSL Bus Compressor]] is the defining VCA compressor, known for fast, precise, and clean dynamic control. Nomograph Mastering's compressor guide identifies VCA as one of the four main compressor types (alongside FET, opto, and variable-mu), each with distinct sonic characteristics. VCA compressors excel at "glue" — making bus groups feel cohesive — and are the community's go-to for mix bus and drum bus compression.

See [[Compression Techniques]] for the full topology breakdown.
