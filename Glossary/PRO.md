# PRO

## Definition

Performing Rights Organization — an entity that collects performance royalties on behalf of songwriters and publishers when their compositions are performed publicly (radio, streaming, live venues, TV, etc.). The major US PROs are ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. International equivalents include PRS (UK) and SOCAN (Canada).

## Context

The #biz-talk community emphasizes that registering compositions with a PRO is essential for collecting performance royalties. Unregistered works earn zero performance royalties regardless of how widely they're played or streamed. PRO registration is separate from both copyright registration and mechanical royalty collection — songwriters need to handle all three to capture their full income. If co-writers use different PROs, both should register the work with their respective organizations.
