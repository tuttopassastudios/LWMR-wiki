# Routing Folder

## Definition

[[Pro Tools]]' folder track type that can sum the outputs of child tracks contained within it, functioning as both an organizational container and an audio bus — combining the visual organization of folders with the signal routing of aux/bus tracks.

## Context

Routing Folders were a significant addition to Pro Tools, addressing the long-standing request for folder tracks that could also handle audio summing. Matthew The Cooke explored folder-as-aux-bus workflows in #pro-tools, discovering both capabilities and limitations — internal routing preservation when moving tracks in and out of folders can be challenging. The community discussed whether Routing Folders fully replace the traditional aux bus workflow, with the consensus being that they supplement it but don't entirely replace dedicated bus routing for complex sessions. This contrasts with [[Cubase]]'s and [[Logic Pro]]'s folder track implementations, which have longer histories of folder-based audio summing.
