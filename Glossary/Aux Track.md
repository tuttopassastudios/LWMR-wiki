# Aux Track

## Definition

An auxiliary track used for audio routing purposes, typically serving as a destination for sends (reverb, delay, and other time-based effects) or as a [[Bus]] for group processing. Called "Return Tracks" in [[Ableton Live]] and "Aux Tracks" in [[Pro Tools]] and [[Logic Pro]].

## Context

Aux tracks are fundamental to efficient mixing workflows. Rather than placing a reverb plugin on every individual track, engineers route multiple tracks via sends to a single aux track hosting the reverb, saving CPU and providing centralized control. Aux tracks are also used for parallel processing techniques such as parallel compression, where a compressed duplicate signal is blended with the dry signal.
