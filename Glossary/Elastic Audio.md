# Elastic Audio

## Definition

[[Pro Tools]]' built-in time-stretching and pitch-shifting engine that allows non-destructive manipulation of audio timing without cutting and moving regions.

## Context

Elastic Audio is used for timing correction, tempo conforming, and quantizing audio to the grid in [[Pro Tools]]. It offers multiple algorithm modes (polyphonic, rhythmic, monophonic, X-Form) suited to different material types. Elastic Audio can be applied in real-time or rendered for higher-quality offline processing via X-Form.
