# Pre-delay

## Definition

The time gap between the original dry signal and the onset of the reverb effect. Pre-delay is measured in milliseconds and is a critical parameter in reverb processing that determines how "close" or "far" a source sounds from the listener. Longer pre-delay separates the source from the reverb wash, maintaining clarity and presence; shorter pre-delay blends the source into the reverb for a more immersive, ambient feel.

## Context

Pre-delay is extensively discussed in #mixing-talk's reverb conversations (within 1,796 reverb/delay categorized messages). The community's practical guidance:

- **Vocals:** 40-80ms pre-delay keeps the vocal upfront and intelligible while still adding depth and dimension
- **Drums:** Shorter pre-delay (0-20ms) for a more intimate, "room" feel; longer for a more dramatic, spaced-out effect
- **General rule:** The pre-delay should be short enough that the reverb feels connected to the source, but long enough that the source retains its definition

In practice, pre-delay prevents reverb from smearing the attack and articulation of the dry signal, which is why it's particularly important on vocals and percussive sources.
