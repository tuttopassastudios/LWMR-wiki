# Melodyne

## Definition

Pitch correction and audio editing software by Celemony, known for its polyphonic pitch editing capabilities and [[ARA]] integration with DAWs.

## Context

Melodyne is a standard tool in vocal production workflows, offering note-level control over pitch, timing, and formants. Its [[ARA]] integration allows direct editing within the DAW timeline in supported hosts like [[Pro Tools]], [[Logic Pro]], [[Cubase]], and [[Studio One]], eliminating the need for offline processing.

## Professional Workflow (from #production-talk)

BatMeckley — Grammy-nominated vocal producer who has worked with Dr. Luke and Rob Cavallo — describes a detailed Melodyne workflow that is the channel's most authoritative pitch correction resource:

> "I would say it's not one or the other. I might do some big timing moves first, just to have the vocal 80% of the way there. I'm talking actually nudging things around, not stretching. Then I'll consolidate and drop into Melodyne. In Melodyne I'll turn the whole thing and also really pay attention to the timing. At this stage it's a lot more stretching and/or compressing notes, or more importantly PARTS of words. Like I'll separate the consonant, and time compress that and bring up the volume so ccchhhhhhhhair becomes CHaaaaiiirrrr."

Key professional insights:
- **Melodyne handles both pitch AND timing** — timing manipulation within Melodyne is equally important to pitch correction
- **Separate consonants from vowels** for more natural-sounding corrections — compress/time-stretch word parts independently
- **Use Melodyne after manual timing nudges** — do rough timing alignment in the DAW first, then fine-tune in Melodyne
- **Comp back untuned bits** — preserve natural phrasing by selectively reverting corrections on notes that sound better raw
- **Demand for Melodyne training is high** — BatMeckley's proposal for a group Melodyne session received 33 reactions, and Slow Hand's request for learning resources received 32

### Melodyne vs Auto-Tune

The #production-talk community uses both tools with distinct roles:
- **Melodyne** — detailed pitch/timing work, polyphonic editing, surgical corrections
- **Auto-Tune** — real-time tone shaping, creative effect (the "Auto-Tune sound"), Classic mode for vintage artifacts
- BatMeckley: "on a lot of the Luke records I worked on we were using Melodyne for tune and Auto-Tune for tone"
