# XLR

## Definition

A professional audio connector standard using a 3-pin (or more) circular connector for balanced audio signals. XLR cables carry audio on two signal conductors plus a ground, providing common-mode noise rejection that makes them resistant to electromagnetic interference over long cable runs.

## Context

XLR is the standard connector for professional microphones, preamps, mixing consoles, and studio monitors. In #newbie-questions, beginners frequently ask about XLR vs 1/4" (TRS) vs USB connections:

- **XLR microphones** connect to audio interfaces or preamps and require an interface with XLR inputs (and [[Phantom Power]] for condensers)
- **USB microphones** bypass the need for an interface but offer less flexibility and lower quality than XLR setups
- **TRS/TS (1/4")** cables are used for instruments, line-level signals, and headphones

Expert consensus in #newbie-questions: start with an XLR microphone and a proper audio interface rather than a USB mic — the investment pays off as you grow.
