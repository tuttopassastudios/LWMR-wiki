# Bit Depth

## Definition

The number of bits used to represent each audio sample in a digital audio system. 16-bit is the CD standard, 24-bit is the professional recording and mixing standard, and 32-bit float is used for internal DAW processing. Bit depth determines the theoretical dynamic range of the audio signal.

## Context

Each additional bit of depth adds approximately 6dB of dynamic range. 16-bit audio provides ~96dB of dynamic range, while 24-bit provides ~144dB. Recording at 24-bit is standard practice as it provides ample headroom and low noise floor. When delivering final masters at 16-bit (for CD or certain streaming formats), [[Dithering]] should be applied to preserve detail.
