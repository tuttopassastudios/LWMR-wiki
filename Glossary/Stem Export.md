# Stem Export

## Definition

The process of rendering grouped submixes (such as drums, bass, vocals, guitars, and effects) as individual audio files for delivery to mixing engineers, mastering engineers, or collaborators. Stems differ from multitracks in that stems are pre-mixed subgroups, while multitracks are individual raw tracks.

## Context

Stem export workflows vary significantly between DAWs. [[Cubase]] is frequently praised for its batch export capabilities. [[Ableton Live]] has historically been criticized for requiring manual solo-and-export workflows, though newer versions have improved this. [[Pro Tools]] offers solid stem export through bus routing. Proper stem delivery typically includes clearly labeled files, consistent start times, and documentation of tempo and [[Sample Rate]].
