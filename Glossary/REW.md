# REW

## Definition

Room EQ Wizard (REW) is free, open-source room acoustic measurement and analysis software. It generates test signals, captures microphone measurements (typically via a [[UMIK-1]] or similar calibrated measurement mic), and produces frequency response plots, waterfall plots, RT60 decay measurements, and other acoustic analysis data used to evaluate and optimize room treatment.

## Context

REW is the community's standard tool for measuring room acoustics before and after treatment. Josh Bowman's weekend renovation story — moving his desk because "it's insanely better looking on the REW graph" — exemplifies how REW data drives studio design decisions. The software pairs with calibrated USB measurement microphones (miniDSP UMIK-1 being the most common) and is used alongside [[Sonarworks SoundID]] for room correction.

The community consensus is that REW measurements should be taken before and after every treatment change to verify improvements rather than relying on subjective listening alone.
