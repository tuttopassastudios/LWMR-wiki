# Proximity Effect

## Definition

An increase in bass response that occurs when a sound source is placed very close to a directional (cardioid, figure-8, etc.) microphone. The closer the source, the more pronounced the low-frequency boost. Omnidirectional microphones do not exhibit proximity effect.

## Context

Proximity effect is a common topic in #newbie-questions when beginners notice their vocal recordings sound boomy or muddy. It's both a problem and a creative tool:

- **Problem:** Singers who "eat the mic" get an unnatural bass buildup that requires heavy EQ correction
- **Creative use:** Radio broadcasters and voiceover artists deliberately use proximity effect for a warm, full sound
- **Solution for beginners:** Maintain 6-12 inches from the microphone for a natural tonal balance, or use a high-pass filter to compensate

### Microphones and Proximity Effect

- **Cardioid mics** (most studio condensers and dynamics) — exhibit moderate proximity effect
- **Figure-8 / bidirectional** — exhibit the strongest proximity effect
- **Omnidirectional mics** — no proximity effect (one reason they sound natural for classical recording)
- **The SM7B** — has a built-in bass rolloff switch partly to compensate for proximity effect in close-miking applications
