# Parallel Compression

## Definition

A mixing technique where a heavily compressed copy of a signal is blended with the uncompressed original. Also called "New York compression" (popularized by New York recording studios in the 1970s-80s). The technique adds density, sustain, and perceived loudness while preserving the natural transients and dynamics of the original signal.

## Context

Parallel compression is one of the most widely recommended techniques in #mixing-talk (discussed within 2,443 compression-related messages). The community favors it on drums (using an [[UREI 1176]] in all-buttons mode on a parallel send), vocals (for adding body without squashing dynamics), and the mix bus (for subtle overall density).

The community strongly prefers using **dedicated aux sends** for parallel compression rather than plugin wet/dry knobs, as sends provide independent control over the compressed signal's level, EQ, and further processing.

Common settings for the parallel bus: high ratio (10:1 to all-buttons), fast attack, fast release — deliberately "crushing" the signal so it adds sustain and density when blended at low levels beneath the dry original.
