# Warp Mode

## Definition

[[Ableton Live]]'s system for time-stretching and pitch-shifting audio clips. Includes six algorithms, each suited to different types of audio material: Beats (rhythmic loops), Tones (monophonic melodic content), Texture (ambient/textural sounds), Re-Pitch (speed-based pitch change like tape), Complex (polyphonic content), and Complex Pro (highest fidelity for polyphonic material).

## Context

Warp modes are central to Ableton Live's workflow, enabling tempo-independent playback and creative audio manipulation. Choosing the wrong warp mode for a given piece of audio can introduce artifacts such as rhythmic stuttering, metallic tones, or smeared transients. Complex Pro offers the highest fidelity but consumes the most CPU. Other DAWs offer similar time-stretching algorithms under different names — [[Logic Pro]] uses Flex Time, [[Pro Tools]] uses Elastic Audio, and [[Cubase]] uses AudioWarp.
