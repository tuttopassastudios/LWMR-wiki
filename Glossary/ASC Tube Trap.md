# ASC Tube Trap

## Definition

Cylindrical bass absorbers manufactured by Acoustic Sciences Corporation (ASC). Tube traps are free-standing, portable acoustic treatment devices designed to absorb low-frequency energy, particularly effective in corners and behind the mix position. They feature a half-reflective, half-absorptive design that can be rotated to tune the room's high-frequency response.

## Context

Tube traps are widely discussed in the community as a premium but effective portable treatment solution. They are especially valued by engineers working in rented spaces who cannot make permanent modifications. Slow Hand compiled a tube trap resource document (13 reactions in #monitoring-talk) that became a community reference. Nomograph Mastering jokingly calls them "for suckers" while acknowledging their effectiveness — the humor reflects the community's awareness that proper built-in treatment is superior but tube traps remain the gold standard for portable bass management.
