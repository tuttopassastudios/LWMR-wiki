# Memory Location

## Definition

[[Pro Tools]]' marker and locator system for session navigation, allowing engineers to store and recall specific timeline positions, zoom settings, track visibility states, and selection ranges within a session.

## Context

Memory Locations are a fundamental Pro Tools navigation tool used extensively in professional sessions. They can store simple timeline markers (verse, chorus, bridge), but also complex window configurations including zoom level, track height, and which tracks are visible — making them powerful for switching between different editing and mixing views within the same session. In #pro-tools, andrew_yv discussed using Memory Locations as a workaround for arrangement markers, since Pro Tools lacks a dedicated arrangement track. The Memory Locations window provides a list view for quick navigation across long sessions.
