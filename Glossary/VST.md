# VST

## Definition

Virtual Studio Technology, a cross-platform audio plugin format developed by Steinberg. VST3 is the current version, offering improved CPU efficiency and features over the legacy VST2 format. VST is the most widely supported plugin format across DAWs.

## Context

VST and VST3 plugins are supported by [[Cubase]], [[Reaper]], [[Ableton Live]], and many other DAWs. Notably, [[Pro Tools]] does not support VST, requiring [[AAX]] instead. On macOS, VST coexists with [[AU]] (Audio Units), and many plugin developers ship both formats.
