# DI Box

## Definition

A Direct Injection (DI) box converts a high-impedance, unbalanced signal (from instruments like electric guitar, bass, or keyboards) to a low-impedance, balanced signal suitable for connection to a microphone preamp or mixing console. DI boxes also typically include a ground lift switch to eliminate [[Ground Loop]] hum.

## Context

"What is a DI and when do I need one?" is a recurring #newbie-questions topic. The short answer: whenever you want to plug an instrument directly into your audio interface or console without going through an amplifier.

### Types

- **Passive DI** — uses a transformer, no power required, handles high-level signals well. Good for active instruments (keyboards, active bass)
- **Active DI** — uses electronics (requires battery or phantom power), better for low-output instruments (passive guitar pickups). Provides cleaner signal with passive pickups
- **Tube DI** — adds warmth/harmonic coloring. Premium options like the [[A Designs REDDI]] are studio staples

### Common Uses

1. **Bass guitar recording** — DI + amp mic is the standard professional approach (see [[Bass Recording]])
2. **Guitar [[Reamping]]** — record a clean DI signal to re-amp later through different amps
3. **Keyboards/synths** — DI provides balanced, noise-free connection to the console
4. **Ground loop elimination** — the ground lift switch breaks hum-causing ground loops

### Popular Models

- **Radial JDI** (passive) — industry standard (see [[Radial DI]])
- **Radial J48** (active) — popular for passive instruments
- **Countryman Type 85** — studio classic
- **A Designs REDDI** — premium tube DI
