# Transient

## Definition

The initial, short-duration burst of energy at the beginning of a sound — the "attack" portion of the amplitude envelope. Transients are most prominent in percussive sounds (drums, plucks, consonants in speech) and are responsible for the perceived "punch," "snap," and "clarity" of a source. Transient shaping is the process of enhancing or reducing transients to control the perceived attack and sustain of a sound.

## Context

Transients are a fundamental concept in #mixing-talk discussions about compression, drum mixing, and mix bus processing. Key community insights:

- **Compressor attack time** directly controls how transients are treated — a slow attack lets transients through (preserving punch), while a fast attack clamps them down (reducing punch but adding control)
- **Clipping before compression** is a technique discussed for taming extreme transients (from drum hits) without causing compressor pumping — the clipper catches the peak, and the compressor handles the body
- **Transient designers** (SPL Transient Designer, Sonnox Oxford TransMod) allow independent control of attack and sustain, useful for reshaping drum sounds
- **Parallel compression** adds sustain and body while preserving the original transient — the dry signal keeps the attack while the compressed signal fills in the body

In drum mixing specifically, transient management is central: allowing kick and snare transients through bus compression (via slow attack settings) is a core technique for maintaining punch in a compressed drum bus.
