# Audio Unit Extension

## Definition

Apple's modern plugin format (AUv3) that runs in a sandboxed environment, used in [[Logic Pro]], GarageBand, and iOS music apps. Successor to the original Audio Unit (AU) format.

## Context

AUv3 plugins run as app extensions within Apple's sandboxing model, enabling cross-platform compatibility between macOS and iOS. This format allows the same plugin to run on an iPhone, iPad, and Mac. While AUv3 adoption is growing, many professional plugins still use the original [[AU]] format, and some DAWs support both simultaneously.
