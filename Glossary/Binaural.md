# Binaural

## Definition

Audio technique that uses two microphones or processing algorithms to create a 3D stereo sound experience, simulating how human ears perceive spatial audio.

## Context

In DAW workflows, binaural rendering is primarily used as a monitoring method for spatial audio and [[Dolby Atmos]] mixes when a full speaker array is unavailable. The Dolby Atmos Renderer and Logic Pro both provide binaural output modes for headphone monitoring. Apple Spatial Audio uses binaural rendering with head tracking on compatible headphones.
