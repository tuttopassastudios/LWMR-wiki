# DDP

## Definition

Disc Description Protocol — the standard file format for delivering mastered audio to CD manufacturing plants. A DDP image contains the mastered audio, PQ codes (track start/end markers), ISRC codes, CD-TEXT metadata, and UPC/EAN barcode information in a single package.

## Context

DDP replaced physical CD-R masters as the standard delivery method from mastering engineers to pressing plants. It eliminates the risk of burning errors, disc degradation, and shipping damage that physical masters are subject to.

In #mastering-talk, DDP is discussed primarily in the context of album mastering workflows and vinyl/physical delivery (657 vinyl/physical messages). Key points:

- DDP files can be verified with player software before sending to the plant
- Track spacing and transitions are encoded in the DDP (see [[Album Mastering and Sequencing]])
- Some mastering engineers offer "Platinum DDP" options as premium tiers (tongue-in-cheek community humor)
