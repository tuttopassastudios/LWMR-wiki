# AudioSuite

## Definition

[[Pro Tools]]' offline/destructive plugin processing system that renders plugin effects directly to audio files rather than processing them in real-time. AudioSuite processes audio selections and writes the result to disk, replacing or creating new audio files.

## Context

AudioSuite is considered one of Pro Tools' unique advantages — no other major DAW has an equivalent offline plugin processing system with the same depth and flexibility. It is essential for [[iZotope RX]] noise reduction, offline pitch correction, time compression/expansion, and batch processing. AudioSuite plugins can process selections of any length without consuming real-time CPU resources, making it invaluable for post-production workflows where large quantities of audio need consistent processing. The closest equivalents in other DAWs are [[Cubase]]'s Direct Offline Processing and [[Logic Pro]]'s [[Selection-Based Processing]], though the community considers both less refined than AudioSuite.
