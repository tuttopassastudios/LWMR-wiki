# Control Surface

## Definition

Hardware device with physical faders, knobs, and buttons used to control a DAW's mixing functions, providing tactile feedback similar to an analog console.

## Context

Control surfaces range from compact units like the Avid S1 to full console-style systems like the Avid S6 or SSL UF8. They communicate with DAWs via protocols such as HUI, MCU, or proprietary EUCON, allowing hands-on control of volume, panning, plugin parameters, and transport functions.
