# Bus

## Definition

A virtual audio pathway that combines multiple signals for group processing. Used for submixing (drum bus, vocal bus, instrument bus) and parallel processing. The term originates from analog console architecture where physical bus bars carried combined signals.

## Context

Bus routing is a core mixing technique. Common uses include grouping all drum tracks to a drum bus for cohesive compression and EQ, routing vocals to a vocal bus for group processing, and creating parallel processing chains. The routing capabilities and ease of bus creation vary by DAW — [[Cubase]] and [[Pro Tools]] are frequently cited for flexible bus routing, while [[Ableton Live]]'s Group Tracks serve a similar function with a different workflow.
