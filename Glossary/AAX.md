# AAX

## Definition

Audio plug-in format developed by Avid, required for use in [[Pro Tools]]. Stands for "Avid Audio eXtension." Replaced the older RTAS and TDM formats.

## Context

AAX is the only plugin format supported by [[Pro Tools]], which limits plugin choices compared to DAWs supporting [[VST]] and [[AU]]. Some community members have noted stability concerns with newer AAX plugins.
