# Summing

## Definition

The mathematical process of combining multiple audio signals into fewer channels, such as mixing multiple tracks down to a stereo output. All major DAWs perform summing identically using IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point arithmetic.

## Context

A persistent myth in audio production holds that different DAWs "sound different" due to their summing engines. [[Null Test]] comparisons have consistently demonstrated that when given identical input, all major DAWs produce bit-identical output. Any perceived differences are attributable to plugin processing, panning laws, or gain staging rather than the summing algorithm itself.
