# Split Sheet

## Definition

A document that defines the ownership percentages of a song among its creators. Split sheets establish who wrote what percentage of a composition, covering both lyrics and music, and serve as the foundational record for royalty distribution.

## Context

Split sheets are the single most recommended legal document in #biz-talk. The community emphasizes completing one before or immediately after every co-writing or co-production session — not weeks later when memories differ and tensions may arise. Even a simple email confirming splits can serve as documentation. Templates are widely available through [[PRO|PROs]] (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC) and online.
