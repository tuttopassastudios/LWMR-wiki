# Clip Gain

## Definition

Pre-fader gain adjustment applied directly to an audio clip/region before it reaches the channel fader and insert processing chain. Available in [[Pro Tools]], [[Logic Pro]], and most modern DAWs.

## Context

Clip gain is a fundamental editing tool for managing level inconsistencies within a single track before the signal hits compressors and other dynamics processors. By adjusting clip gain, engineers can even out performance dynamics at the source level, reducing the workload on downstream processing. In [[Pro Tools]], clip gain is displayed as a line overlaid on the audio waveform and can be automated per-clip.

## Use Cases from #pro-tools

Rob Domos described a use case for mass clip gain adjustment: setting clip gain to -infinity on hundreds of clips that need to be silenced without deleting them or using mute automation. This is faster than muting individual clips or drawing automation, and preserves the clip structure for potential future use.
