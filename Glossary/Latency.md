# Latency

## Definition

The delay between input and output in a digital audio system, primarily determined by [[Buffer Size]] and [[Sample Rate]]. Measured in milliseconds. Critical during recording and monitoring, less significant during mixing.

## Context

Latency is an inherent characteristic of digital audio processing. Round-trip latency includes the time for audio to travel from an input, through the computer's processing, and back out to the monitors or headphones. Most performers find latency above 10-12ms noticeable and distracting. Many audio interfaces offer direct monitoring to bypass software latency during recording.
