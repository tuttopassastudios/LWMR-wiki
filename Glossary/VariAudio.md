# VariAudio

## Definition

Cubase's built-in pitch editing and correction tool, integrated directly into the Sample Editor. VariAudio provides note-level control over pitch, timing, vibrato, and formants for monophonic audio — similar to [[Melodyne]] but without requiring a third-party plugin.

## Context

VariAudio is one of [[Cubase]]'s standout features, offering pitch correction that competes with [[Melodyne]] for standard vocal tuning tasks. Community consensus holds that VariAudio wins for speed and integration (no ARA overhead, instant access in the Sample Editor), while Melodyne offers superior polyphonic editing and finer control. Power users like Lee Rouse employ a multi-tool workflow: VariAudio for quick tuning passes, Auto-Tune for real-time tracking correction, and Melodyne for detailed polyphonic editing. SoundsLikeJoe highlights VariAudio's split-note function and vibrato control as underutilized features. The "free mode" allows dragging notes to non-chromatic positions for blue notes and microtonal work.

Lee Rouse's "delete block" technique: in VariAudio, deleting an analyzed segment disables tuning for that region without affecting surrounding corrections — useful for preserving natural phrasing on specific notes.
