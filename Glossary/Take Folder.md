# Take Folder

## Definition

A [[Logic Pro]] feature for managing multiple recording takes within a single track lane. When recording multiple passes over the same section, Logic automatically creates a **take folder** containing all takes stacked vertically. The user can then **quick swipe comp** across takes to assemble the best performance — similar to [[Pro Tools]]' playlist comping system.

## Context

Take folders are one of Logic Pro's most praised workflow features, considered superior to [[Ableton Live]]'s comping implementation (Ross Fortune, #daw-talk). The workflow involves:
- **Pack takes** — combine multiple audio regions into a take folder
- **Unpack folder** — extract individual takes back to separate tracks (useful for cross-DAW handoff)
- **Flatten** — commit the comped result to a single audio region
- **Quick swipe comping** — click-drag across take lanes to select the best sections from each take

When handing off sessions to other DAWs, the recommended approach is to unpack the take folder and export each take as a mono file (hyanrarvey, oaklandmatt, #logic-pro).
