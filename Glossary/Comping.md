# Comping

## Definition

The process of selecting the best portions from multiple recorded takes to create a single composite (or "comp") performance. Engineers record several passes of a performance, then assemble the strongest sections from each take into one seamless track.

## Context

Comping workflows are a key differentiator between DAWs. [[Pro Tools]]' playlist system is widely regarded as the gold standard for comping, allowing engineers to record multiple takes on playlists and quickly audition and assemble the best sections. [[Logic Pro]]'s take folders offer a similarly efficient visual comping workflow. [[Ableton Live]] added basic comping functionality in version 11, though it remains less refined than dedicated comping tools in other DAWs. [[Cubase]] and [[Reaper]] also provide competent comping workflows.

## Recording-Talk Perspective

BatMeckley's philosophy on comping from #recording-talk: "Very rarely is a take ALL bad. 'I especially loved the first three words and the last one. Let's focus on that energy' is helpful." The community emphasizes that comping should serve the performance, not replace it -- chasing technical perfection at the expense of emotion is considered a common mistake.

## Pro Tools Comping Deep Dive (from #pro-tools)

EliHeathMusic's pinned message in #pro-tools documents the essential keyboard shortcuts for playlist-based comping — the channel's only pinned message, reflecting its community value. Key comping insights from the channel:

- **Playlist navigation shortcuts** — EliHeathMusic's comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts for creating, duplicating, and switching between playlists during comping sessions
- **Dual-mic comping challenges** — when recording with two microphones (e.g., close and room mic), comping decisions on one track must be precisely correlated to the other to maintain phase coherence. This requires group editing or careful manual playlist management
- **Playlist color coding** — jerikcenteno uses Pro Tools' color palette to visually distinguish between playlists for faster navigation
- **Cut Time playlist limitation** — Matthew The Cooke discovered that Cut Time doesn't affect alternate playlists, potentially destroying take alignment during arrangement editing
