# Comping

## Definition

The process of selecting the best portions from multiple recorded takes to create a single composite (or "comp") performance. Engineers record several passes of a performance, then assemble the strongest sections from each take into one seamless track.

## Context

Comping workflows are a key differentiator between DAWs. [[Pro Tools]]' playlist system is widely regarded as the gold standard for comping, allowing engineers to record multiple takes on playlists and quickly audition and assemble the best sections. [[Logic Pro]]'s take folders offer a similarly efficient visual comping workflow. [[Ableton Live]] added basic comping functionality in version 11, though it remains less refined than dedicated comping tools in other DAWs. [[Cubase]] and [[Reaper]] also provide competent comping workflows.
