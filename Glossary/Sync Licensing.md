# Sync Licensing

## Definition

Licensing music for use in visual media — television, film, advertisements, video games, and online content. Sync (synchronization) licenses grant the right to pair a musical composition and/or master recording with visual imagery. Both the composition owner (publisher) and the master recording owner (label or artist) must grant permission.

## Context

The #biz-talk community identifies sync licensing as one of the most viable alternative revenue streams for music professionals, particularly as streaming royalties become increasingly concentrated at the top. Unlike streaming income, sync fees are typically negotiated as one-time payments (with potential backend for performance royalties when the content airs), making them more predictable. The community notes that retaining your publishing rights is critical for sync opportunities — if you've sold your publishing, you can't authorize sync placements.
