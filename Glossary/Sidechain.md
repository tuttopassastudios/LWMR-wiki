# Sidechain

## Definition

A technique in which one audio signal (the "key" or "trigger") controls a processor applied to a different audio signal. The most common application is sidechain compression, where a kick drum signal triggers a compressor on a bass or pad track, causing it to duck in volume with each kick hit, creating a rhythmic pumping effect.

## Context

Sidechain compression is ubiquitous in electronic music production and increasingly common across all genres for managing frequency conflicts between kick and bass. Beyond compression, sidechaining can be applied to gates, EQs, and other dynamics processors. The ease of sidechain routing varies by DAW — [[Ableton Live]] makes it straightforward through its routing dropdowns, while [[Pro Tools]] uses key input assignments on dynamics plugins.
