# Dolby Atmos

## Definition

Immersive audio format by Dolby that uses object-based audio and height channels (typically 7.1.4 bed) to create three-dimensional soundscapes.

## Context

Dolby Atmos has become increasingly relevant in music production as streaming platforms (Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music) support spatial audio playback. Atmos mixes combine a channel-based bed (7.1.4) with individually positioned audio objects, rendered by the Dolby Atmos Renderer for the listener's specific playback system.
